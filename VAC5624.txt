            PREFACE.
            WE turn, here, a few leaves in the great Book of Human Life. The writing thereon,
               though occasionally less grave than gay, is not without its lessons of wisdom. If, at
               any scene portrayed or any sentiment uttered, the reader should smile, we are sure it
               will not be at rude vulgarity, heartless Wit, or the triumph of strength over
               weakness. While we offer, in these pages, a pleasant recreation for leisure hours, it
               is such a recreation as will, we trust, leave the mind active with good purposes and
               kindly sympathies.

                     The Wife.
                  
               
               THE WIFE.
               "I AM hopeless!" said the young man, in a voice that was painfully desponding.
                  "Utterly hopeless! Heaven knows I have tried hard to get employment! But no one
                  has need of my service. The pittance doled out by your father, and which comes
                  with a sense of humiliation that is absolutely heart-crushing, is scarcely
                  sufficient to provide this miserable abode, and keep hunger from our door. But for
                  your sake, I would not touch a shilling of his money, if I starved."
               "Hush, dear Edward!" returned the gentle girl, who had left father, mother, and a
                  pleasant home, to share the lot of him she loved; and she laid a finger on his
                  lips, while she drew her arm around him.
               "Agnes," said the young man, "I cannot endure this life much longer. The native
                  independence of my character revolts at our present condition. Months have
                  elapsed, and yet the ability I possess finds no employment. In this country, every
                  avenue is crowded."
               The room in which they were overlooked the sea.
               "But there is another land, where, if what we hear be true, ability finds
                  employment and talent a sure reward." And, as Agnes said this, in a voice of
                  encouragement, she pointed from the window toward the expanse of waters that
                  stretched far away toward the south and west.
               "America!" The word was uttered in a quick, earnest voice.
               "Yes."
               "Agnes, I thank you for this suggestion! Return to the pleasant home you left for
                  one who cannot procure for you even the
                  plainest comforts of life, and I will cross the ocean to seek a better fortune in
                  that land of promise. The separation, painful to both, will not, I trust, be
                  long."
               "Edward," replied the young wife, with enthusiasm, as she drew her arm more
                  tightly about his neck, "I will never leave thee or forsake thee. Where thou goest
                  I will go, and where thou diest I will die. Thy people shall be my people, and thy
                  God my God."
               "Would you forsake all," said Edward, in surprise, "and go far away with me into a
                  strange land?"
               "It will be no stranger to me than it will be to you, Edward."
               "No, no, Agnes! I will not think of that," said Edward Marvel, in a positive
                  voice. "If I go to that land of promise, it must first be alone."
               "Alone!" A shadow fell over the face of Agnes. "Alone! It cannot—it must not
                  be!"
               "But think, Agnes. If I go alone, it will cost me but a small sum to live until I
                  find some business, which may not be for weeks, or even months, after I arrive in
                  the New World."
               "What if you were to be sick?" The frame of Agnes slightly quivered as she made
                  the suggestion.
               "We will not think of that."
               "I cannot help thinking of it, Edward. Therefore entreat me not to leave thee, nor
                  to return from following after thee. Where thou goest, I will go."
               Marvel's countenance became more serious.
               "Agnes," said the young man, after he had reflected for some time, "let us think
                  no more about this. I cannot take you far away to this strange country. We will go
                  back to London. Perhaps another trial there may be more successful."
               After a feeble opposition on the part of Agnes, it was finally agreed that Edward
                  should go once more to London, while she made a brief visit to her parents. If he
                  found employment, she was to join him immediately; if not successful, they were
                  then to talk further of the journey to America.
               With painful reluctance, Agnes went back to her father's house, the door of which
                  ever stood open to receive ceive her; and she went back alone. The pride of her
                  husband would not permit him to cross the threshold of a dwelling where his
                  presence was not a welcome one. In eager suspense, she waited for a whole week ere
                  a letter came from Edward. The tone of this letter was as cheerful and as hopeful
                  as it was possible for the young man to write. But, as yet, he had found no
                  employment. A week elapsed before another came. It opened in these words:—
               
                  "MY DEAR DEAR AGNES! Hopeless of doing any thing here, I have turned my
                     thoughts once more to the land of promise; and when you receive this, I will be
                     on my journey thitherward. Brief, very brief, I trust, will be our separation.
                     The moment I obtain employment, I will send for you, and then our reunion will
                     take place with a fulness of delight such as we have not yet experienced."
               
               Long, tender, and hopeful was the letter; but it brought a burden of grief and
                  heart-sickness to the tender young creature, who felt almost as if she had been
                  deserted by the one who was dear to her as her own life.
               Only a few days had Edward Marvel been at sea, when he became seriously
                  indisposed; and, for the remaining part of the voyage, was so ill as to be unable
                  to rise from his berth. He had embarked in a packet ship from Liverpool bound for
                  New York, where he arrived, at the expiration of five weeks. There he was removed
                  to the sick wards of the hospital on Staten Island, and it was the opinion of the
                  physicians there that he would die.
               "Have you friends in this country?" inquired a nurse who was attending the young
                  man. This question was asked on the day after he had become an inmate of the
                  hospital.
               "None," was the feebly uttered reply.
               "You are very ill," said the nurse.
               The sick man looked anxiously into the face of his attendant.
               "You have friends in England?"
               "Yes."
               "Have you any communication to make to them?"
               
               Marvel closed his eyes, and remained for some time silent.
               "If you will get me a pen and some paper, I will write a few lines," said he, at
                  length.
               "I'm afraid you are too weak for the effort," replied the nurse.
               "Let me try," was briefly answered.
               The attendant left the room.
               "Is there any one in your part of the house named Marvel?" asked a physician,
                  meeting the nurse soon after she had left the sick man's room. "There's a young
                  woman down in the office inquiring for a person of that name."
               "Marvel—Marvel?" The nurse shook her head.
               "Are you certain?" remarked the physician.
               "I'm certain there is no one by that name for whom any here would make inquiries.
                  There's a young Englishman who came over in the last packet, whose name is
                  something like that you mention. But he has no friends in this country."
               The physician passed on, without further remark.
               Soon after, the nurse returned to Marvel with the writing materials for which he
                  had asked. She drew a table to the side of his bed, and supported him as he leaned
                  over and tried, with an unsteady hand, to write.
               "Have you a wife at home?" asked the nurse; her eyes had rested on the first words
                  he wrote.
               "Yes," sighed the young man, as the pen dropped from his fingers, and he leaned
                  back heavily, exhausted by even the slight effort he had made.
               "Your name is Marvel?"
               "Yes."
               "A young woman was here just now inquiring if we had a patient by that name."
               "By my name?" There was a slight indication of surprise.
               "Yes."
               Marvel closed his eyes, and did not speak for some moments.
               "Did you see her?" he asked at length, evincing some interest.
               "Yes."
               "Did she find the one for whom she was seeking?"
               "There is no person here, except yourself, whose name came near to the one she
                  mentioned. As you said you had no friends in this country, we did not suppose that
                  you were meant."
               "No, no." And the sick man shook his head slowly.
               "There is none to ask for me." "Did you say it was a young woman?" he inquired,
                  soon after. His mind dwelt on the occurrence.
               "Yes. A young woman with a fair complexion and deep blue eyes."
               Marvel looked up quickly into the face of the attendant, while a flush came into
                  his cheeks.
               "She was a slender young girl, with light hair, and her face was pale, as from
                  trouble."
               "Agnes! Agnes!" exclaimed Marvel, rising up. "But no, no," he added, mournfully,
                  sinking back again upon the bed; "that cannot be. I left her far away over the
                  wide ocean."
               "Will you write?" said the nurse, after some moments.
               The invalid, without unclosing his eyes, slowly shook his head. A little while the
                  attendant lingered in his room, and then retired.
               "Dear, dear Agnes!" murmured Edward Marvel, closing his eyes, and letting his
                  thoughts go, swift-winged, across the billowy sea. "Shall I never look on your
                  sweet face again? Never feel your light arms about my neck, or your breath warm on
                  my cheek? Oh, that I had never left you! Heaven give thee strength to bear the
                  trouble in store!"
               For many minutes he lay, thus alone, with his eyes closed, in sad self-communion.
                  Then he heard the door open and close softly; but he did not look up. His thoughts
                  were far, far away. Light feet approached quickly; but he scarcely heeded them. A
                  form bent over him; but his eyes remained shut, nor did he open them until warm
                  lips were pressed against his own, and a low voice, thrilling through his whole
                  being, said—
               "Edward!"
               "Agnes!" was his quick response, while his arms were thrown eagerly around the neck of his wife. "Agnes!
                  Agnes! Have I awakened from a fearful dream?"
               Yes, it was indeed her of whom he had been thinking. The moment she received his
                  letter, informing her that he had left for the United States, she resolved to
                  follow him in the next steamer that sailed. This purpose she immediately avowed to
                  her parents. At first, they would not listen to her; but, finding that she would,
                  most probably, elude their vigilance, and get away in spite of all efforts to
                  prevent her, they deemed it more wise and prudent to provide her with every thing
                  necessary for the voyage, and to place her in the care of the captain of the
                  steamship in which she was to go. In New York they had friends, to whom they gave
                  her letters fully explanatory of her mission, and earnestly commending her to
                  their care and protection.
               Two weeks before the ship in which Edward Marvel sailed reached her destination,
                  Agnes was in New York. Before her departure, she had sought, but in vain, to
                  discover the name of the vessel in which her husband had embarked. On arriving in
                  the New World, she was therefore uncertain whether he had preceded her in a
                  steamer, or was still lingering on the way.
               The friends to whom Agnes brought letters received her with great kindness, and
                  gave her all the advice and assistance needed under the circumstances. But two
                  weeks went by without a word of intelligence on the one subject that absorbed all
                  her thoughts. Sadly was her health beginning to suffer. Sunken eyes and pale
                  cheeks attested the weight of suffering that was on her.
               One day it was announced that a Liverpool packet had arrived with the ship fever
                  on board, and that several of the passengers had been removed to the hospital.
               A thrill of fear went through the heart of the anxious wife. It was soon
                  ascertained that Marvel had been a passenger on board of this vessel; but, from
                  some cause, nothing in regard to him beyond this fact could she learn. Against all
                  persuasion, she started for the hospital, her heart oppressed with a fearful
                  presentiment that he was either dead or struggling in the grasp of a fatal malady.
                  On making inquiry at the hospital, she was told the one she sought was not there,
                  and she was about returning to the city when the truth reached her ears.
               "Is he very ill?" she asked, struggling to compose herself.
               "Yes, he is extremely ill," was the reply. "And it might not be well for you,
                  under the circumstances, to see him at present."
               "Not well for his wife to see him?" returned Agnes. Tears sprung to her eyes at
                  the thought of not being permitted to come near in his extremity. "Do not say
                  that. Oh, take me to him! I will save his life."
               "You must be very calm," said the nurse; for it was with her she was talking. "The
                  least excitement may be fatal."
               "Oh, I will be calm and prudent." Yet, even while she spoke, her frame quivered
                  with excitement.
               But she controlled herself when the moment of meeting came, and, though her
                  unexpected appearance produced a shock, it was salutary rather than injurious.
               "My dear, dear Agnes!" said Edward Marvel, a month from this time, as they sat
                  alone in the chamber of a pleasant house in New York, "I owe you my life. But for
                  your prompt resolution to follow me across the sea, I would, in all probability,
                  now be sleeping the sleep of death. Oh, what would I not suffer for your
                  sake!"
               As Marvel uttered the last sentence, a troubled expression flitted over his
                  countenance. Agnes gazed tenderly into his face, and asked—
               "Why this look of doubt and anxiety?"
               "Need I answer the question?" returned the young man. "It is, thus far, no better
                  with me than when we left our old home. Though health is coming back through every
                  fibre, and my heart is filled with an eager desire to relieve these kind friends
                  of the burden of our support, yet no prospect opens."
               No cloud came stealing darkly over the face of the young wife. The sunshine, so
                  far from being dimmed, was brighter.
               "Let not your heart be troubled," said she, with a beautiful smile. "All will come
                  out right."
               
               "Right, Agnes? It is not right for me thus to depend on strangers."
               "You need depend but a little while longer. I have already made warm friends here,
                  and, through them, secured for you employment. A good place awaits you so soon as
                  strength to fill it comes back to your weakened frame."
               "Angel!" exclaimed the young man, overcome with emotion at so unexpected a
                  declaration.
               "No, not an angel," calmly replied Agnes, "only a wife. And now, dear Edward," she
                  added, "never again, in any extremity, think for a moment of meeting trials or
                  enduring privations alone. Having taken a wife, you cannot move safely on your
                  journey unless she moves by your side."
               "Angel! Yes, you are my good angel," repeated Edward.
               "Call me what you will," said Agnes, with a sweet smile, as she brushed, with her
                  delicate hand, the hair from his temples; "but let me be your wife. I ask no
                  better name, no higher station."
            
            
               
               
                  
                     The Dead Dove.
                  
               
               THE DEAD DOVE.
               "IT is only a bird, Ada," said the young lover of the gentle girl; "why should you
                  grieve over its death?"
               "If the song sparrow had died, or the little wren, or even the robin," replied
                  Ada, sadly, "my heart would not have felt the pain that now oppresses it; but to
                  look upon a dead dove touches my feelings deeply."
               "But why should you feel more pain because a dove has died? Its life is the same
                  as the life of a robin, a sparrow, or a wren."
               "No, not the same, Henry."
               "Wherein lies the difference?"
               "Are not their bodies different?"
               "Oh yes."
               "It is because their lives are different that their bodies vary in appearance:
                  each is a form of affection; the sparrow of one affection, and the dove of
                  another. And this is the reason why, in looking upon one, we are affected
                  differently from what we are when we look at another."
               "A strange doctrine, Ada, is it not?"
               "Oh no. What makes the wolf differ from the lamb? Is it not his affection, of
                  which his body is the repulsive form? The wolf is embodied cruelty, and the lamb
                  is embodied innocence. And how good is our all-wise and merciful Creator in thus
                  placing before our eyes, in this world, embodied affections, that we may the more
                  fully understand their evil or good qualities! When we look upon a cruel beast, we
                  have a more perfect idea of the direful nature of those affections in our hearts
                  which originate in self-love; and when we look at an innocent lamb, or a gentle dove, we perceive the beauty of
                  good affections."
               "Yours is a beautiful theory, Ada; and, if true, how full of life! With what new
                  eyes would I look around me on the visible forms of nature, if I could believe as
                  you believe."
               "I cannot believe otherwise," said Ada, as she lifted her eyes from the bird in
                  her hand, and looked tenderly at her lover.
               "And this dove—to what affection does it correspond, and why are you so deeply
                  touched by its death?"
               "Need you ask, Henry? Is it not the embodied form of a pure, confiding love—such
                  love as only a woman's heart can feel? And do you wonder that I am pained to see
                  the death of such a love? Can I help thinking of woman's trusting heart
                  betrayed?—of affection trampled out under the foot of neglect and wrong?" And
                  tears came into the eyes of the pure-hearted girl.
               "Dear Ada!" said the young man, earnestly, "why will you let such painful thoughts
                  come into your mind? They have no business there: your heart will never know
                  betrayal; your affection will never be trampled out under the crushing foot of
                  neglect."
               "I did not think of myself," returned Ada, quickly; "I thought only of
                  others."
               The young man pressed his lips to hers, and then their eyes drooped from each
                  other's, and rested upon the form of the dead dove.
               "Never shall her heart feel the pangs of neglect; never, no, never!" said the
                  lover, in earnest self-communion.
               May his words prove a true prophecy; and if, in after life, his heart swerve, even
                  for an instant, from its affection, may the form of the dead dove present itself,
                  and warn him of the ruin his infidelity would occasion!
            
            
               
               
                  
                     Uncle Basil's Valentine.
                  
               
               UNCLE BASIL'S VALENTINE.
               UNCLE BASIL; dear old man! It's a shame for me to play off my tricks upon him. But
                  it seems as if I couldn't help it, sometimes. He's such a fine "subject,"—so
                  earnest-hearted, so strangely literal and simple-minded for a man who has passed
                  along through the world of business, and gained the ripe age of three score and
                  five years.
               Dear old man! Well may I say that; for he has been to me, since the light of my
                  fifth summer shone upon my head, in the place of father, mother and friend. And do
                  I not love him? How warmly my heart responds to the question!
               And yet, for all, I can't help teasing him, now and then. The fun is in me, and
                  must come out.
               "Hetty," said he, looking up from his newspaper one evening—he has such a passion
                  for newspapers—"Hetty, I suppose you know that Valentine's day is but a week
                  off."
               "Valentine's day!" The remark was so abrupt, and said in such a meaning tone,
                  that, in spite of me, I couldn't keep the blood from mounting to my face. I had no
                  cause for blushes, and yet the blushes came.
               "Yes, Valentine's day! What is the matter with the girl? Aha!"
               I blushed deeper still. How vexed I was. There was no cause for blushes. This, to
                  thee, reader, upon honour!
               "No lover, then?" On the word of a maiden of seventeen, no! You are
                  convinced, of course.
               "Aha! my little lady! what does all this mean?"
               
               And uncle Basil fixed his eyes keenly upon me.
               My face was now like scarlet. Finding all efforts to regain self-possession
                  fruitless, I sprang from my chair and left the room.
               For very vexation I cried on entering my chamber.
               "Never mind! you'll pay for this," said I, after my heart beat calmly again.
                  "You'll pay for this, my dear, good old bachelor uncle! Valentine's day, is it?
                  Very well."
               I punished the old gentleman by not letting him see the light of my countenance
                  again until the next morning at breakfast. Then I was all smiles, and in perfect
                  self-possession. He seemed to have forgotten the little incident of the previous
                  evening, but I had not.
               On that very day, I went out and selected a valentine. It had on it a great red
                  heart, pierced by an arrow from Cupid's quiver. Two whole hours were spent in
                  composing suitable verses to grace the love missive, which I laid carefully by
                  until the thirteenth of February, when it was committed to post-office
                  guardianship, directed to "Basil Jones, Esq."
               On the next morning, as we sat at breakfast, Uncle Basil looked at me archly and
                  said—
               "Has that valentine come yet?"
               I wanted to blush, but couldn't. I tried to look confused, but my countenance
                  would not play hypocrite. I was too merry at heart.
               Our meal ended, the old gentleman retired to the sitting-room, to read the morning
                  papers, and wait for John, who had gone, as usual, to the post-office, to return
                  with his letters. It seemed to me that John staid a long while. At last I heard
                  him enter, and listened to his steps as he made his way to my uncle's apartment.
                  As soon as he withdrew, I went, on tip-toe, to the door of the room, which
                  happened to be left ajar. Noiselessly pushing it open, I had a full view of uncle
                  Basil. He had already unsealed his love-letter, and was, gazing in ludicrous
                  bewilderment and astonishment upon its emblematic devices and "tender lines."
               "Why, uncle Basil!" I exclaimed, in a tone of affected surprise, bursting suddenly
                  in upon him, and snatching the letter from his hand. "What is the meaning of this?
                  A valentine, as I live! Uncle Basil! Who would have thought it? And at your age,
                  too! Fie!"
               As I live, the dear old man blushed almost as deeply as I had done a few evenings
                  before, and looked so ashamed and confused, that I half repented of what I had
                  done.
               "Come, come, you saucy jade!" he said, partially recovering himself, and reaching
                  out his hand. "Give me that letter."
               "Letter, indeed! I call this a valentine." And I held it high above my head. "Oh!
                  if I don't show this to everybody. Who could have sent it? Let me look at the
                  handwriting. It's the widow Williams's, as I live."
               "Hetty! Hetty! You mad young rattle-brain, give me that letter!"
               I darted playfully about the room, for a short time, but in the end permitted him
                  to pluck the valentine from my hand, which he did with an exhibition of more
                  agility than I thought in him. In a moment after he had grasped it, the hearts and
                  darts and tender lines were in a "blaze of glory."
               "O uncle Basil!" I lifted my finger and looked into his disturbed countenance,
                  with an arch and merry expression upon my own. "The widow Williams!"
               Just as I said this, my eyes rested upon the superscription of a letter lying upon
                  the floor—one of two or three just brought in by John—that had fallen as the old
                  gentleman started up when I snatched away from him his valentine. It was directed
                  to me. Stooping quickly, I caught it from the floor, and slipped it into my bosom;
                  not, however, so adroitly as to escape observation.
               "Aha! What's the meaning of that?" said uncle Basil, recovering himself in an
                  instant.
               It was now my turn to show confusion. To cover it, I beat a hasty retreat, and was
                  soon locked in my own room. How short, quick, and imperative, were the motions of
                  my heart, as it throbbed almost audibly in my bosom. It was some moments before I
                  was calm enough to break the seal of my "valentine."
               From whom had it come? How instinctive was this question. As I held it in my fingers, still looking
                  at the superscription, and trying to make out the hand-writing, I felt something
                  hard within. Instantly the seal was broken and the envelope removed. There was a
                  sheet of note-paper, bearing the words, "A Love Token," and enclosing a crumpled
                  piece of white tissue paper covering the hard substance that proved to be a
                  diamond ring and a diamond breastpin! For some moments I was bewildered. Then all
                  was clear. My uncle did not mean that I should be deceived as to the sender of my
                  valentine, for his well known, strong, mercantile chirography in the words, "A
                  Love Token," left nothing for my vagrant imagination to dream over.
               Dear old man! How rebuked I felt. A little while I sat thoughtful, and then went
                  bounding down stairs to the sitting-room.
               "A kiss for your Love Token," said I, as I threw my arms around his neck, and laid
                  my warm lips upon his venerable forehead.
               I had not the heart to tell him then that I was the widow Williams from whom his
                  valentine came. But we have since had more than one hearty laugh together over the
                  remembrance of his sudden surprise and confusion when I caught him absorbed in the
                  mysteries of a love-letter.
            
            
               
                  
               
               KATE'S VALENTINE.
               KATE, my sprightly niece, like most young ladies of her age, has her own opinions
                  on matters and things currently transpiring. She thinks independently, and
                  generally speaks what she thinks. Of course, her knowledge of human nature is not
                  very deep; nor is she as wise in all her conclusions as she is led to imagine. I
                  do not say this disparagingly, for Kate has quite as good sense as nine in ten who have only numbered her
                  years, which are about twenty-one.
               On one subject, Kate had, for a year or two, been particularly decided in her
                  expressions. The Valentine epidemic, which has raged so violently, she considered
                  a social disease emphatically. It was no healthy manifestation of right feelings,
                  in her estimation.
               As last St. Valentine's day approached, and as the store windows and counters
                  began to be filled with emblematic love missives of all kinds, from the most
                  costly, delicate, and refined, down to the cheapest, coarsest, and most vulgar,
                  Kate exhibited more and more strongly her antipathy to the custom about to be
                  honoured.
               "If any one were to send me a valentine," said she, "I would take it as a direct
                  insult to my common sense."
               "Oh, as for that," I replied, sportively, "lovers are not so silly as to address
                  the common sense of those whose favour they desire to win."
               "Whoever wins me," was her prompt answer, "must appeal to that. At no other point
                  will I be accessible."
               "We shall see."
               "And we will see."
               "I'll wager a new hat against a spring bonnet," said I, "that you receive a
                  valentine this year from a certain young man named—Never mind; don't blush so; I
                  won't name him."
               "I would discard any one who insulted me with a valentine," replied Kate,
                  indignantly.
               "Don't say that, for fear you will have cause to repent the indiscretion."
               "Yes, I do say it. No man of good sense would stoop to such trifling."
               "I don't know, Kate. A little trifling, now and then, is relished by the best of
                  men."
               "That's rhyme, which does not always go hand in hand with reason."
               "You'll grow wiser, Kate, as you grow older."
               "If that is the kind of wisdom age brings, I'm sure I don't want it."
               I answered with a laugh, for to be grave on such a theme was not in me. As the
                  fourteenth approached, Kate frequently repeated her expressions of disgust at the
                  silly custom of sending valentines that had become so popular, and declared, over
                  and over again, that such a liberty with her, would be taken as a direct insult,
                  and resented accordingly.
               Among the visiting acquaintances of Kate, was a young man named Loring, for whom,
                  I could see, she had kinder feelings than for any other male friend; but, either
                  in consequence of a natural reserve of character, or because he was in doubt as to
                  Kate's sentiments regarding himself, he never seemed perfectly at ease in her
                  company, though he sought it on every proper occasion. I had him in my mind when I
                  suggested the reception of a valentine from a certain young man, and Kate
                  understood me perfectly.
               Well, Valentine's day came round. At dinner-time, I came home as usual, and almost
                  the first word my wife said to me was—
               "What do you think? Kate's received a valentine."
               "Indeed!"
               "It's true. It came by the Despatch Post. I received it at the door, and sent it
                  up to her room."
               "Have you seen her since?"
               "No."
               "Of course, she's particularly indignant."
               "I don't know any thing about that. It was a handsome one I infer, from the size
                  and envelop; and had in it something hard, which I took for jewelry—a breastpin or
                  a bracelet."
               "Where do you think it came from?" said I.
               "I've guessed young Loring," answered my wife.
               "If he has sent it, he has committed a great mistake," I replied.
               "How so?"
               "You know Kate's antipathy to valentines."
               "Young ladies often talk a great deal without really knowing what they say; and
                  Kate is not altogether free from the fault," said my wife.
               I readily enough assented to this. When the bell rung for dinner, Kate came down
                  from her room. Her face was rather more sober than usual, and she did not join in the conversation with her
                  accustomed animation. She was first to retire from the table.
               "I don't think she is mortally offended," said I to my wife.
               "No, not if I am skilled in mental indications," was replied.
               During the afternoon, two or three more love missives came; but not a word
                  touching their reception, or the feelings produced thereby, was breathed by Kate.
                  It was plain, however, to one with even half an eye, that she was pleased at the
                  mark of attention, or, it might be, token of love. Evening, instead of being
                  passed as usual with the family, was spent by Kate in her room.
               On the next morning, at the breakfast table, I mentioned the fact that a certain
                  number of valentines had passed through the post-office on the day before. This
                  was in order to introduce the subject, and call out some remark from Kate; but she
                  remained silent on the subject, though not without indicating, by her heightened
                  colour and restless eye, that her thoughts were busy enough.
               "I rather think our young lady has changed her opinions," said I, smiling, after
                  Kate had left the table.
               "Circumstances alter cases, you know," replied my wife, smiling in turn.
               On the next evening, young Loring called in. Kate was longer than usual in making
                  her appearance, and when she came into the parlour, was dressed with more than
                  ordinary care. For the first time, I noticed on her wrist a new and beautiful
                  bracelet. She blushed, slightly, as she met Loring; seemed a little embarrassed,
                  but was soon conversing with him in an animated style.
               "Did you see that new bracelet?" asked my wife, when we were next alone.
               "I did."
               "Where did it come from?"
               "Didn't you say that in one of the valentines she received there was something
                  hard, like a piece of jewelry?"
               "Yes."
               "That bracelet, probably."
               "No doubt of it."
               "And, moreover," said I, "it is plain that she believes the valentine came from
                  Loring; for, at her first meeting with him, she wears it for the first time."
               "Thus," remarked my wife, "notifying him that she receives the token kindly."
               I laughed aloud, for I could not help it.
               "Why do you laugh?" asked my wife.
               "She was going to discard any one who insulted her with a valentine!"
               "That was idle talk. I've heard such things said before."
               Two or three evenings went by, and Loring came again. Since his former visit, the
                  new bracelet had not been seen. Now it was worn again. As we knew the young man
                  well, and liked him the better the more intimately we knew him, we saw no
                  impropriety in leaving the young couple alone in the parlour.
               From that time, there was a marked change in my niece. She was less sprightly and
                  more absent-minded than usual. Next, her appetite failed her, and she began to
                  grow thin and lose her colour—sure signs of a heart disease. Meanwhile, Loring was
                  a constant visiter; and whenever he came, the bracelet was displayed, evidently in
                  token that she knew from whence it came, and wished its full acceptance to be
                  understood. At last, I received a formal visit from the young man, and a formal
                  offer for the hand of Kate. Of course, I had no objections to urge. The matter
                  was, in my mind, already fully settled.
               After that, the bracelet aforementioned was always to be seen on the arm of Kate.
                  One evening, it was about a month before her wedding-day, as I sat talking with
                  Kate, for whom my affection had always been as tender as that of a father for his
                  child, I took her hand, and said, as I examined the bracelet—
               "That is very beautiful."
               "Yes, I have always admired it very much," she replied, the colour growing warmer
                  in her cheeks.
               "A love-token, I presume?"
               And as I said this, I looked at her archly. The hue of her cheeks became still
                  deeper.
               "A valentine?" I added.
               
               The blood mounted to her temples.
               "But it was not an ordinary valentine. It did not come from a trifler, and was not
                  received as an insult. I thought you were not the girl, Kate, to reject a sincere
                  offer."
               Kate blushed still more deeply.
               "This little love-token, dear Kate, is for thee:
               Accept it, and keep it, and wear it for me."
               As I repeated this couplet, the young girl started with surprise, and looked with
                  inquiring earnestness in my face.
               "But I'm afraid, Kate," said I, with a meaning smile, and a voice half-regretful
                  in its tone, "that you wore it less for the real than for an imaginary giver."
               She did not reply, but looked at me more earnestly, while a sudden light appeared
                  to break upon her mind.
               "Dear uncle," said she, at length, bending toward me, "had you seen this bracelet
                  before you saw it on my arm?"
               "Yes, love," was my tenderly spoken reply; and I pressed her pure forehead with my
                  lips as I spoke.
               "And you sent it?"
               She seemed half breathless as she awaited my reply.
               "Yes, dear."
               She covered her face suddenly with her hands and sat motionless for some moments.
                  In a little while, I saw a tear come stealing through her fingers. My feelings
                  were touched, for I feared lest I had done violence to hers by this little
                  confession of the truth. But, ere I had looked for composure of mind, she withdrew
                  her hands from her face, on which an affectionate smile shone like a rainbow amid
                  the parting drops of a summer shower, and said, as she arose—
               "Henceforth, I will wear it for the real giver."
               Bending to kiss me, she left a tear on my cheek, and then glided from the
                  room.
               On her wedding night, Kate wore her valentine bracelet; and I am weak enough to
                  believe—if the sentiment may be called a weakness—that she prized it even more
                  highly than if Loring himself had been the giver.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     The Red Ear.
                  
               
               THE RED EAR; OR, THE HUSKING FROLIC.
               IN rural districts, the merrymakings have a natural heartiness about them never
                  seen in cities, towns, nor villages. Overweening self-respect has not come in to
                  fetter the motions of the body, nor to smother the laugh in its free utterance.
                  Feeling and action are in close relationship. You come nearer to nature,
                  untrammelled by custom and unaffected by art.
               A merrymaking par excellence, is, (or was,) a
                  New England husking frolic. The husking frolic at the South is a different affair
                  altogether. There, it is a congregation of negroes from the various plantations
                  near at hand, who, while they work, make the air vocal almost for miles around
                  with their rude melodies, a few of which have been rendered familiar to ears
                  polite by the "Serenaders" who have so highly amused the public during the past
                  two or three years. But at the North, the "husking," like the "quilting," draws
                  together the gentle maidens and loving swains of a neighbourhood, who meet to
                  enjoy themselves in their own way. And such enjoyment as they have, in kind and
                  degree, is not to be met with every day. In former times, the "husking" was a
                  wilder affair than at present. Straight-laced conventionality is gradually finding
                  its way beyond the city limits, and binding the free spirits of our country
                  maidens. They meet oftener with the "city folks," gradually falling more and more
                  into their habits as they partake more and more of their spirit; and, when they
                  assemble for enjoyment, they check their
                  impulses, restrain their movements, and hush almost into silence the merry
                  laughter that seeks to leap forth like the singing waters of the fountain. No;
                  "huskings" are not what they were. Instead of seeing on the threshing-floor a
                  troop of young men and maidens, stripping from the bright ears of grain their
                  leafy coverings, amid laughter, music, and the mingling of sweet voices, as of
                  old, mere "labour" comes in too often to perform the service, and silently and
                  coldly does its work. Yet, here and there, a farmer, who cannot forget the
                  pleasant times when he was young, sends forth his annual summons after the maize
                  harvest is gathered, and then comes a merrymaking for old and young that is
                  enjoyed in a way never to be forgotten.
               Old Ephraim Bradley was a man of this school. If his head grew white under the
                  falling snows of many winters, the grass was fresh and green, and the flowers ever
                  blooming on his heart. With him, the annual "husking" was never omitted. It was,
                  like Christmas and Thanksgiving, almost a sacred thing, half involving sin in the
                  omission.
               Kate Mayflower, a wild romp of a girl from Boston—at least some in the city
                  regarded her as such—was spending a few weeks in D—, when invitations came to
                  attend a husking party at Ephraim Bradley's. The old man lived some three miles
                  from the village. Kate had heard about husking parties, and her young spirits
                  leaped up when the announcement was made that one was to be held in the
                  neighbourhood, and that she was invited to be present. It was a frolic that, from
                  all she had heard, would just suit her temperament, and she set off, when the time
                  came, to make one of the party, in the merriest possible mood.
               Evening had closed in on the arrival of the party from D—, who quickly joined some
                  score or two of young people in the large kitchen, where lay heaped up in the
                  centre a huge pile of Indian corn.
               "All that to be husked?" whispered Kate, as she entered the room.
               "Oh yes! all that and more, perhaps," was the smiling reply. "We have come to
                  work, you know."
               "Now, gals," said old Mr. Bradley, who stood looking on as the young folks
                  gathered, with bright faces, around the golden grain, "now for a good
                  old-fashioned time. If there are not half a dozen weddings between this and
                  Christmas, I shall say there is no virtue in red ears."
               As he ceased, down dropped, amid gay voices and laughter, the whole company upon
                  the floor, in all graceful and ungraceful positions, in a circle around the pile
                  of corn. Kate alone remained standing, for the movement was so sudden that she
                  could not act with it.
               "Here's room for you, Kate," cried one of the girls who had come with her, making
                  a place by her side; and down sank Kate, feeling, for the first time, a little
                  awkward and confused. Beside her was a stout rough country youth, whose face was
                  all 
                     merrriment
                     merriment
                  , and whose eyes were dancing with anticipated pleasure. The city girl
                  eyed his rough, brown hands, coarse garments, and unpolished face, with a slight
                  feeling of repulsion, and drew a little from him toward her friend.
               "Oh, plenty of room, miss! Plenty of room," said he, turning broadly around, and
                  addressing her with a familiar leer. "The tighter we fit in, the better. Lay the
                  brands close, if you want a good fire."
               Kate could not help laughing at this. As she laughed, he added—
               "All free and easy here." He had grasped an ear of corn, and was already stripping
                  down the husk. "A red ear!" suddenly burst from his lips, in a tone of triumph;
                  and, as he spoke, he sprang toward, or rather upon Kate, with the grace of a young
                  bear, and kissed her with a "smack" that might have been heard a dozen rooms off.
                  Ere she had time to recover from the surprise, and, it must be admitted,
                  indignation, occasioned by this unexpected assault upon her lips, the hero of the
                  first "red ear" was half around the circle of struggling girls, kissing both right
                  and left with a skill and heartiness that awoke shouts of applause from the young
                  "fellers," who envied his good fortune.
               That was a new phase of life to Kate. She had heard of kissing as an amusement
                  among young folks, and had often thought that the custom was too good to have
                     become come obsolete; but a practical
                  view, and a personal participation like this, was a thing that her imagination
                  had, in none of its vagaries, conceived. An old-fashioned, straight-backed,
                  flag-bottomed chair stood near, and, unwilling to trust herself again upon the
                  floor, Kate drew that into the circle, and seated herself close to the pile of
                  corn just as the young man had completed his task of kissing every girl in the
                  room.
               "First rate that!" said he, smacking his lips, as he threw himself at her feet.
                  "Wasn't I lucky?"
               Kate's indignation had, by this time, all melted away under a lively sense of the
                  ludicrous, and she could not help laughing with the merriest. Soon another red ear
                  was announced, and then the kissing commenced again. Such struggling, wrestling,
                  screaming, and laughing, Kate had never heard nor seen. The young man who held the
                  prize had all the nerve required to go through with his part, as Kate clearly
                  proved when it came to her turn to receive a salute. Springing from her chair, she
                  fled into the next room; but this only increased his eagerness to touch the lips
                  of "the beautiful girl from Boston," and he soon had his arms around her and his
                  hands upon her cheeks. The struggle was long and well sustained on the part of the
                  maiden; but her fate was to be kissed, and kissed by a rough young countryman whom
                  she had never met before. The deed was done, and then the blushing, panting girl
                  was led back in triumph to the room from which she had escaped.
               Red ears were in plenty that evening. It was shrewdly guessed that every young man
                  had come with at least two in his pockets, for all the girls avowed that never
                  before had Farmer Bradley's field of corn produced so many. As for Kate, she was
                  kissed and kissed, until making, as she alleged to her friend, a virtue of
                  necessity, she submitted with the kindliest grace imaginable; and, if the truth
                  must be told, enjoyed the frolic with as lively a zest as any one present.
               At length the great pile of corn disappeared, and the company arranged themselves
                  for dancing; but they had hardly been on the floor half an hour, when supper was
                  announced—and such a supper as that was! No pyramids of ice-cream or candied
                  oranges. No mock nor real turtle; nor oysters in a dozen styles. Turkeys there
                  were, but not scientifically "boned." No; there were none of the fashionable city
                  delicacies; but instead, "a gigantic round of beef in the centre of the table was
                  flanked on either side with vegetables. A bouncing junk of corned-beef was at one
                  end, and a big chicken-pie at the other. An Indian pudding, of ample dimensions,
                  stood forth between the middle and end of the end dishes, and a giant pot of beans
                  loomed up on the other side; while pumpkin-pies, apple-sauce, and a host of other
                  'fixings' filled up the spaces."
               This was the bill of fare for the evening, and our city belle looked on with a new
                  surprise, as she saw the articles disappearing one after another like frost work
                  on window-panes at sunrise. If the good wife did not say on this, as was said on a
                  similar occasion, "Lay hold, and help yourselves, gals—make a long arm; and let
                  the men folks take keer of themselves. If any on you likes turnips squat and buttered, squat and butter 'em to suit yourselves"—at
                  least as hearty and primitive an invitation to go to work on the good things was
                  extended, and no one could complain that it was not acted upon. What followed is
                  best given in the language of one who has already described a similar scene:—
               "The guests seemed to do ample justice to the viands; mirth and festivity reigned
                  around the board. Jokes, witticisms, and flashes of fun would occasionally 'set
                  the table in a roar.' All appeared determined to enjoy themselves at the 'top of
                  their bent.'
               "Soon as supper was over, all the girls lent a hand, and the table was cleared
                  away in a jiffy. Blindman's buff was then introduced; the company now was
                  uproarious! Dancing was the next consideration. Amos Bunker screwed up his viol,
                  resined the bow, and 'did up' the toe-and-heel inspiring notes of Fisher's
                  hornpipe; while a number of the party, who were somewhat skilled in the
                  terpsichorean art, put in the 'double shuffle rigadoon.' Presently the lookers-on
                  caught the enthusiasm, and the whole
                  company, old and young, adepts and novices, took the floor and did their utmost: 
                     
                        "Twas right and left, and down outside, six round and back to back:
                        Harum-scarum, helter skelter, bump together, whack.'
                     
                  
               
               "And thus was the husking kept up til the old clock, which stood in one corner of
                  the kitchen, beat out twelve; then broke up this jolly gathering."
               So it was at old Farmer Bradley's. When Kate went back to Boston, she was free to
                  own that she had enjoyed a new kind of merrymaking, and avowed her purpose to be
                  at old Ephraim Bradley's when the next husking came off.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     Cooks.
                  
               
               COOKS.
               MR. JOHN BROWN was a man of orderly mind and systematic habits. His business went
                  on like clock work; and he would have it so. If the least irregularity appeared,
                  you may be sure he would see it and know the reason.
               "All you have to do," he would sometimes say, "is to will to have things right. A
                  resolute purpose is every thing."
               This doctrine he uniformly preached to Mrs. Brown on the occasion of every
                  domestic irregularity; especially when she complained that she could not make
                  cook, nurse, or chambermaid do as she wished.
               "Establish a certain rule, and see that it is obeyed," he would say to her.
                  "That's my plan, and I have no trouble. An employé of mine knows that it is as much as his place is worth to go
                  contrary to rule; and, if you made the keeping of a place in your household
                  dependent on strict obedience to your orders, you would have far less
                  trouble."
               "It is very easy to talk," Mrs. Brown would generally reply to these
                  suggestions.
               "And just as easy to act,"would respond Mr. Brown. "I know. I've tried it. You
                  have only to resolve to have a thing done right, and it is done. Nothing more easy
                  in the world. There is Judson, my neighbour, an easy sort of a man, with no-order
                  in his mind. Well, of course, every thing around him is at sixes and sevens; and
                  he's always complaining that he can never get anybody to do as he wishes. Give him
                  the best clerk in the city, and he'll spoil him in three months. And why? There is
                  no order in the man's business. He has no system tem. I have two young men in my store who were so
                  worthless with Judson, according to his own account, that he had to send them off.
                  I wouldn't ask for better clerks. In the beginning, I let them understand I was a
                  man who would have things my own way, and they soon understood that this was not a
                  mere matter of words. It's the order, Jane—the order. Fix an order in your
                  household, and all this trouble will cease."
               "Order among intelligent clerks may be easily enough attained," said Mrs. Brown to
                  her husband, one morning, after some remarks of this kind, which had arisen from
                  the fact of company being expected to dinner; "but I'd like to see the order you
                  would maintain with a parcel of subordinates like our Biddy to deal with. I
                  imagine you'd find your hands full. Ignorant Irish girls are not so easy to bring
                  into order."
               "A good system and a good resolution are all that is wanted."
               "You think so?"
               "I know so."
               "I wish you had the trial for a week."
               "You'd see a different state of things," confidently replied the husband.
               "No doubt of it," returned Mrs. Brown; who was hurt by her husband's rebuking
                  manner, and showed it in her tone of voice.
               Mr. Brown 'was a kind-hearted man—what cannot always be said of very
                  orderly people—and was pained to see the effect of his words.
               "Oh well, never mind, Jane," said he soothingly. "We can't all do alike. I know
                  you manage excellently on the whole. But won't you, to-day, watch Biddy a little
                  closer, and see that she has dinner at the hour? She is so apt to be late. I
                  wouldn't like Mrs. Clark and Mrs. Agnew to notice any thing irregular in our
                  household economy."
               "I presume our household arrangements are fully as good as theirs," said Mrs.
                  Brown a little sharply, for she was more fretted in mind than her husband
                  supposed.
               "That may all be; but won't you see that Biddy has dinner precisely at three?"
               "I'll do the best I can, but can't promise any thing," said Mrs. Brown, whose mind
                  her husband had chafed so much that she did not attempt to conceal her
                  annoyance.
               Mr. Brown went away grumbling to himself, and Mrs. Brown went into the kitchen,
                  and, in no very amiable tone of voice, said to Biddy—
               "We're to have company to dine with us to-day, and Mr. Brown expects dinner on the
                  table precisely at three. Now, pray, don't let it be a minute later."
               Biddy always made it a point to be cross whenever there was company. This
                  announcement alone, no matter in how amiable a tone it had been made, would have
                  sufficed to arouse her ill-nature; but coming as it did, in a fretful voice, she
                  was filled instantly with a spirit of opposition. Not the slightest reply did she
                  make—not the smallest sign that she heard escaped her.
               Mrs. Brown stood a few minutes and then said, angrily—"Did you hear what I
                  said?"
               "I'm not deaf, marm," pertly returned Biddy.
               "Then why didn't you answer me?"
               Biddy turned away with a contemptuous toss of the head, and resumed her work.
               "See here, my lady!"—But Mrs. Brown checked herself, for she knew Biddy's temper,
                  and understood that, in entering into a regular contest with her, the question of
                  victory would be doubtful. In all probability, it would end in her being compelled
                  to order the insolent creature out of the house; and then who was to cook the
                  dinner? This thought caused Mrs. Brown to curb her feelings, and to put a bridle
                  upon her tongue.
               "Biddy," said Mrs. Brown, after pausing a few moments to compose herself—she spoke
                  calmly—"we are to have company to-day, and I wish dinner on the table precisely at
                  three o'clock."
               Then Mrs. Brown left the kitchen, and went up to her sitting-room, feeling, as may
                  well be supposed, no little "out of sorts." As to dinner being ready at three
                  precisely, she had no expectation of the thing whatever. Mr. Brown would be
                  seriously annoyed, and all her pleasures would, of course, be destroyed. No very
                  agreeable anticipation this, in view of having company.
               
               An hour after Mr. Brown went away, one of his men brought home a basket of
                  marketing. On its arrival, Mrs. Brown descended once more to the lower regions of
                  her house, in order to ascertain the nature of the provision that had been made,
                  and to give some directions to her cook. Biddy received her mistress in no very
                  amiable mood. In fact, she cast upon her a glance of defiance as she entered. The
                  basket looked over, and a few brief directions given, Mrs. Brown retired. There
                  was to be trouble that day with Biddy—nothing was more apparent.
               About twelve o'clock, the ladies who were engaged to dine, arrived. Their husbands
                  would come at three, with Mr. Brown. Mrs. Brown's heart was full; and, as from the
                  abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, she entertained her visitors during the
                  first hour with her troubles with servants. The subject was an interesting one to
                  them, for they were housekeepers, and prepared to sympathize. They had also their
                  own trials to relate, and were eloquent upon their sufferings. As for cooks, they
                  were all voted to be a most horrible set of creatures, and the authors of more
                  domestic misery than was to be charged to any other account. In the midst of an
                  interesting discussion of this kind, Mrs. Brown excused herself, and went to pay a
                  visit of exploration into Biddy's department. Things didn't look very encouraging.
                  She had been entrusted with the work of preparing certain articles of desert; but
                  Mrs. Brown saw at a glance they were destined to be spoiled unless she took charge
                  of them herself. So, without remarking on the subject, she told Biddy to go up to
                  her room and get her an apron.
               This was done with a certain air, the meaning of which was not mistaken. But Mrs.
                  Brown didn't choose to be drawn into a regular quarrel. She took the apron, and,
                  tying it on, went to work at the puddings, and soon had them just to her liking.
                  After giving careful directions to have the ovens in good order, before they were
                  put in, she went up stairs and rejoined her company. At two o'clock, Mrs. Brown
                  visited the kitchen again. Nothing was as forward as it should have been, and cook
                  was in as bad humour as ever.
               "You'll be late, Biddy, after all," said Mrs. Brown. "This is no kind of a
                  fire."
               "The coal won't burn," replied Biddy.
               "It always has burned. Strange that it doesn't burn now!"
               And Mrs. Brown began to examine the range.
               "No wonder," said she, "with this damper half closed, How could you expect coal to
                  burn without a free draft? There, you can see the fire increasing already. Now do,
                  Biddy, stir yourself; it's after two o'clock."
               Biddy didn't deign an answer to this appeal; and Mrs. Brown, after standing as an
                  observer of her movements for a little while, went up stairs, satisfied that no
                  dinner would be ready at three o'clock.
               Just at a quarter before three, Mr. Brown arrived, with Mr. Clark and Mr. Agnew,
                  whose wives had already made their appearance.
               "Dinner most ready?" said he to Mrs. Brown, whom he found in the dining-room, soon
                  after his entrance.
               "I believe so," replied Mrs. Brown.
               "It's ten minutes of three."
               "I can't help it," said Mrs. Brown.
               "But I hope, Jane, that dinner isn't going to be late." Mr. Brown spoke in a
                  nervous manner.
               "It won't be ready at three, that's certain. Biddy's been in a dreadful humour all
                  the morning, and has done nothing right."
               "Oh, dear. This want of punctuality does distress me! Why do you keep such a
                  creature about you?"
               "Do, Mr. Brown," said his wife, in an appealing voice, "go into the parlour and
                  wait as patiently as you can until dinner is ready! I'm so nervous now that I can
                  hardly hold a thing in my hands."
               Mr. Brown did as he was desired to do; but his organ of punctuality was in a state
                  of active excitement. Ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty, even forty minutes passed, and
                  there came no welcome sound of the dinner-bell. Unable to curb his impatience any
                  longer, Mr. Brown left the parlour, and once more sought his wife. She was still
                  in the dining-room, where the table was set, but where no sign of the
                  hunger-quelling banquet was discernible.
               
               "In Heaven's name, my dear!" said Mr. Brown, "what has made all this delay?"
               "Go and ask Biddy," replied the over-tired lady; "and, if you get any satisfaction
                  from her on the subject, you will be more fortunate than I am."
               Upon this hint, and acting on the spur of the moment, Mr. Brown hurried off toward
                  the kitchen. He would regulate the matter in quick order. He would have dinner on
                  the table in a twinkling, or know the reason! Such were his thoughts and purposes.
                  Mrs. Brown, anticipating trouble, followed close after her husband.
               "See here, my lady!" was the salutation with which Mr. Brown met Biddy, as he
                  entered the kitchen. "What's the meaning of all this work to-day? Why isn't dinner
                  ready? Are you to be the arbiter of affairs in my house?"
               Now Biddy, as the reader understands by this time, was in a defiant humour. The
                  kitchen she felt to be her castle, and was ever inclined to dispute with any and
                  every one the right of entrance. Had Mrs. Brown kept away during the morning,
                  dinner would have been ready at the hour. But every time the mistress appeared,
                  the cook's temper was more and more ruffled, and her spirit of opposition more and
                  more aroused. Since her husband's arrival, Mrs. Brown had manifested herself to
                  Biddy not less than half a dozen times, and, at each appearance, made some fretful
                  and irritating remarks touching the lateness of dinner. The climax to all this was
                  the sudden entrance of the incensed Mr. Brown. As he came in, Biddy was in the act
                  of turning from the range with a dish in her hands, on which was a large sirloin
                  of beef. The words of Mr. Brown did not have the effect of subduing the spirit of
                  Biddy, as he had anticipated. For a moment, she glared at him with a look of
                  defiance, while her face grew scarlet with anger; then tossing the dish and its
                  contents with a crash at his feet, and plentifully scattering the gravy over his
                  pantaloons and the silk dress of his wife, who came to his side at the moment, she
                  exclaimed, fiercely—
               "There's your dinner! And I hope you're satisfied!"
               There was a long pause of consternation on the part of Mr. and Mrs. Brown, during
                  which Biddy retired from the kitchen with a dignity that may be imagined, but not
                  described. Mr. and Mrs. Brown also retired, and in a manner quite as
                  indescribable; and, seating themselves in the dining-room, collected their
                  scattered wits for a council of war. The lady's silk dress was a sight to be seen.
                  It was perfectly ruined, large patches of grease being freely distributed over the
                  front breadth for a distance of more than half a yard from the bottom. The
                  gentleman's pantaloons were in no better condition.
               "Oh, dear! what is to be done?" said Mrs. Brown, with pale face and panting bosom.
                  "I declare, I'm right sick!"
               "Well, if that doesn't get ahead of me!" exclaimed Mr. Brown, who, struck with the
                  ludicrousness of the scene, hardly knew whether to laugh or to give an angry vent
                  to his feelings.
               "But what are we to do? It's nearly four o'clock now, and the beef is lying upon
                  the kitchen floor!" said Mrs. Brown, in great distress.
               Mr. Brown was a man for an emergency. He was not to be put down teetotally under
                  any circumstances. He had met and conquered many difficulties in his time, and he
                  was not to be overcome by this one.
               "Do the best we can, Jane," said he, speaking with a sudden cheerfulness of
                  manner. "Go and tell Nancy to come down and serve up the dinner, while you change
                  your dress as quickly as possible. I will see our friends in the parlour, and make
                  an apology for the delay. Put a good face on it. Laugh at the joke, and all will
                  be well."
               Mrs. Brown, after demurring a little, went up and did as her husband suggested,
                  while he, becoming more and more alive every moment to the ludicrousness of the
                  scene he had just witnessed, entered the parlour laughing. Here, to the amusement
                  of all parties, he related, in his own way, what had just occurred, exhibiting, at
                  the same time, some evidence of the recent scene in his soiled garments.
               "And now, ladies," said he, smiling, "if you'll take pity on my poor wife, who is
                  changing her dress, and go down and see that Nancy, our good-humoured
                  chamber-maid, serves up the dinner in some kind of order, you will help to turn a serious matter into a source of
                  merriment."
               Up sprang the two ladies at this hint, and were off to the kitchen in a jiffy,
                  and, with such right good-will did they go to work, that the dinner-bell rang ere
                  Mrs. Brown had finished her toilet.
               A pleasanter dinner-party never assembled at the table of Mr. and Mrs. Brown
                  before nor since. There was good humour, and free and easy conversation in plenty.
                  The cooking stories that were told, if written out, would fill a volume. Cooks
                  were voted to be the veriest torments on the face of the earth. Mrs. Clark and
                  Mrs. Agnew, in relating some of their experiences, frequently set the whole party
                  in a roar.

               COUNTRY BOARDING.
               
                  PART I.
                  Looking for a Nice Farm-house.
                  SUMMER after summer had Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins spent amid the heat and dust and
                     noise of the city, while many of their friends and neighbours sped away to the
                     country, and passed the sultry months where the pure airs played among the
                     cooling shadows, and the bright streams danced along refreshingly through green
                     meadows, or gave a new charm to wood and valley. Often and often had they
                     sighed for a rural season; but, somehow or other, they could never just make it
                     convenient to follow their inclinations in this particular.
                  One day last summer—it was in July, and the thermometer had been ranging from
                     ninety-six to a hundred for nearly a fortnight—on the return home of Mr.
                     Jenkins, at the approach of evening, his good lady said to him, in a fretful
                     tone of voice—
                  "What am I to do with these boys, Mr. Jenkins? The holidays have begun, and
                     they are to be home for two months."
                  "Oh dear!" returned Mr. Jenkins, evincing considerable perplexity of mind at
                     this intelligence. "Two months' holiday! It will be their ruination."
                  "And the death of me," said Mrs. Jenkins. "I can never stand it in the world.
                     I'm almost worried out of my life with them on Saturdays; and what will it be
                     when there are two months of Saturdays? I can't turn Tom and Dick into the street, and let them go
                     into all sorts of company."
                  "No, indeed; that will not do," replied the father.
                  "And they'll never content themselves in the house. That's impossible," said
                     Mrs. Jenkins. "Moreover, it would be cruel to shut them up like prisoners in
                     their own house. I declare, I feel utterly at a loss."
                  "Hadn't we better try to get into the country for a couple of months?"
                     suggested Mr. Jenkins.
                  "I've been thinking of that," replied the wife. "I don't see what better we can
                     do. It would be very pleasant for all of us. We might get boarding in some nice
                     farm house, where there was plenty of good milk, fruit and vegetables. Oh! it
                     would be delightful for the children; and I would enjoy it almost as much as
                     any of them."
                  Mrs. Jenkins's imagination warmed at the very thought.
                  "It's the best thing we can do," said Mr. Jenkins. "The only drawback, is the
                     necessity for my being in the city every day."
                  "Oh, as for that, you know," returned Mrs. Jenkins, confidently, "it will be
                     easy to get a place so near to the city that you can come in early in the
                     morning, and go out before dark in the evening. Cars, steamboats, and stages,
                     afford every facility of this kind."
                  "I'm not so sure of that," said the husband. "Still, there is nothing like
                     trying. How would you like a place in Germantown? The cars run frequently, and
                     pass over the distance in some twenty minutes."
                  "I wouldn't like that at all," was promptly answered. "Germantown isn't the
                     country. I want to go right into the country."
                  "That would be better, certainly."
                  "A plain country farm-house, well shaded, with good, substantial country fare,
                     will be cheapest and best. If we go to the country, let us go to the
                     country."
                  "Perhaps you are right. Well, if we go, we must not hesitate nor delay about
                     the matter. Here it is mid-summer, and the season rapidly passing away."
                  "I'm really in earnest," said Mrs. Jenkins.
                  "I like the idea very much," returned Mr. Jenkins.
                  And they continued to talk and think about the matter during the evening, and
                     lay awake canvassing it for an hour or two after retiring to bed. The result
                     was, a unanimous decision to go into the country as soon as a suitable place
                     could be found.
                  On the next morning, Mr. Jenkins referred to the "Boarding and To Let" column
                     of the Ledger, with an interest never before felt in that department of the
                     paper. To his great satisfaction, he found several advertisements headed
                     "Country Boarding," two of which appeared to suit his case exactly. One of
                     these read thus:—"A respectable family can obtain country boarding, at a
                     farm-house delightfully situated a few miles from the city, in one of the
                     healthiest and most romantic districts of country in the vicinity of
                     Philadelphia. Terms moderate. Inquire at No.—, Market street." The other was in
                     these words:—"A small family, desiring genteel country boarding in a
                     farm-house, with all the comforts of a home, will hear of such a place by
                     inquiring at No.—, Second street."
                  With these two advertisements in his pocket-book, Mr. Jenkins started forth
                     after breakfast, eager to secure one of the places in advance of any other
                     application. His first call was in Market street, at a store where some kind of
                     botanic medicines were sold. A man was behind the counter putting up a package
                     for a customer.
                  "You advertised something about country boarding," said Mr. Jenkins,
                     confidently.
                  "Country boarding?" returned the man, as if he was not certain that he heard
                     aright.
                  "Yes; at a farm-house near the city."
                  "I don't know any thing about it," said the man, indifferently, looking down at
                     the package he was tying up.
                  "Is this No.—?" inquired Mr. Jenkins, as he took the advertisement from his
                     pocket-book, and examined it carefully.
                  "Yes, sir; that is my number," was replied.
                  "Did you put in this advertisement?" and Mr. Jenkins handed him the bit of
                     paper he had cut from the Ledger.
                  
                  The man looked at it for some time before light broke in upon his mind.
                  "Oh!" he at length said. "Now I remember. Yes, yes. It's up the Schuylkill,
                     about a mile from Spring Mill."
                  "Is it a pleasant place?" inquired Mr. Jenkins.
                  "Well, I guess so. But I don't know much about it. Never was there."
                  "Who put in this advertisement?" asked Jenkins.
                  "The man who lives there."
                  "At the farm-house?"
                  "Yes."
                  "What's his name?"
                  "Hodge."
                  "Where can I see him?"
                  "He's in town twice a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Or you can go out to his
                     place."
                  "How can I get there?" asked Jenkins.
                  "You go out to Spring Mill on the Norristown railroad; but I don't know how you
                     get over to Hodge's place."
                  "It's a mile from the river, you say?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Do you know his terms?"
                  The man shook his head, and answered—
                  "The fact is, I don't know any thing about it. Mr. Hodge said he would refer to
                     me, and he has done so; but I have no particular information to give
                     applicants."
                  "He'll be in town on Wednesday, you say?"
                  "Yes," replied the man; and Jenkins departed.
                  Next he applied in Second street, and learned that the "farm-house," which
                     promised all the comforts of a home, was situated in Bucks county, about nine
                     miles from Bristol. This wouldn't do. It would take up too much of his time to
                     travel some sixty miles daily, and he couldn't think of being separated from
                     his family.
                  Twenty acquaintances were asked that day if they knew where country boarding
                     was to be had. From some who had tried the experiment he did not get very
                     flattering accounts; others said they had been endeavouring for weeks to find a
                     place that suited them, but without success. Then one spoke discouragingly of a
                     farm-house or private family, and advised a country tavern, where formal
                     preparations for boarders were made; another said, "Go over into New Jersey, by
                     all means;" while another said, "Go anywhere but in New Jersey." By the close
                     of the day, Jenkins was quite bewildered on the subject of country boarding. A
                     little conversation with his wife, however, brought his mind clear again. The
                     location was to be a farm-house in Pennsylvania, a few miles from the city,
                     easy of access, and plentifully surrounded with shade-trees.
                  On the next morning, two or three new advertisements appeared in the Ledger.
                     One of these seemed the very thing. It described a farm-house, pleasantly
                     situated amid romantic scenery, and easy of access by stages several times a
                     day. As inquiry was to be made on the premises, Mr. Jenkins concluded to go out
                     in the afternoon; and, for this purpose, hired a wagon. The distance was
                     between four and six miles on the West Chester road; and he was not long in
                     reaching the neighbourhood he sought. On inquiring, he learned that the
                     farm-house he wished to visit was half a mile from the turnpike, on a cross
                     road, which he took and kept on his way. In due time, he arrived at the place
                     to which he had been referred; but looked around, in vain, for the elegant
                     situation his mind had pictured.
                  "Can you tell me where Mr. Crabtree lives?" inquired Jenkins, of a man whom he
                     met.
                  "There," said the man, pointing to a small, dingy-looking house a short
                     distance from the road, near which shot up three or four unsightly and decaying
                     Lombardy poplars, and around which clustered a few bits of shrubbery, and one
                     or two old pear-trees, that, if good for fruit, were nearly guiltless of any
                     effort at shade.
                  "That can't be the place of which I am in search." And Jenkins shook his head
                     positively. "I'm looking for a Mr. Crabtree, who takes summer boarders."
                  "There's no other Mr. Crabtree in the neighbourhood," replied the man.
                  "Are you certain?"
                  "I ought to be; for I've lived hereabout all my life."
                  "Does this person take summer boarders?"
                  
                  "He's going to this summer. I heard him say so."
                  "What kind of a man is he?" now inquired Jenkins.
                  "A very nice man," was the unqualified answer.
                  "He seems to have a poor kind of a house."
                  "I wish I had as good a one," was replied to this.
                  "And you're sure that is the place?" said Jenkins.
                  "I'm sure Mr. Crabtree lives there," answered the man.
                  "How will I get to the house?"
                  "Keep along until you come to the old cherry-tree yonder, and turn off into the
                     lane."
                  Jenkins thanked the man for his information and rode on, the ardour of his
                     anticipations sensibly cooled. At the old cherry-tree he turned off, and
                     approached the house, which did not greatly improve in his eyes as he came
                     nearer and nearer. It was built of stone, and was two stories high; but all its
                     dimensions were contracted. Over the door was a narrow portico, supported by
                     wooden posts that had once been white. Upon this clambered a neglected
                     honeysuckle. No walk led to the door, and the grass grew rankly, interspersed
                     with weeds, in front. The ordinary entrance to the house was, evidently, on the
                     other side.
                  The lane terminated at a barn, where Jenkins dismounted and fastened his horse.
                     Then he entered a small gate, and, by a pathway, advanced to the house. He had
                     moved along the path a few rods, and was near the dwelling, when, suddenly,
                     with a deep-mouthed yell, out sprang a savage-looking dog, and made toward him
                     with the evident purpose of trying the quality of his flesh.
                  "Get out!" roared Jenkins, in sudden terror—for the animal was as large and
                     fierce-looking as a wolf—and he stooped to pick up a stone.
                  "Get out!" responded a louder and hoarser voice than his. "Get out, Nero!"
                  And Farmer Crabtree ran from the house, and called off the savage beast just as
                     he was about springing, with mouth extended, upon Jenkins. The dog retired,
                     suspicious and growling at the strange intruder; and the farmer said—
                  "Don't be alarmed, sir. He won't bite you."
                  "Oh no! I'm not alarmed," returned Jenkins, in a voice that trembled so much
                     that he could scarcely articulate.
                  "Come in," said Farmer Crabtree; and Jenkins followed him into the house.
                  "You advertised to take summer boarders," remarked Jenkins as they entered.
                  "Yes, sir," replied the farmer. "We think of taking a family or two. We have a
                     snug place here, and some room to spare. Do you wish to get boarding?"
                  "I do."
                  "For yourself alone?"
                  "For my family. But I hardly think you have room here for so large a family as
                     mine." And Jenkins glanced around the apartment.
                  "How many have you?" asked Crabtree.
                  "Nine. Myself and wife, six children and a nurse."
                  "How old are the children?"
                  "My oldest boy is fourteen, and my youngest three."
                  "Plenty of room for even more. Will you walk upstairs and look at the
                     chambers?"
                  Jenkins expressed a willingness to do so, when the farmer called his wife, and
                     they ascended to the next floor.
                  "This is our spare room," said the farmer's wife, "and a snug room it is. If a
                     body couldn't be comfortable here, they couldn't be comfortable anywhere."
                  The room was about ten feet by twelve, and had windows on two sides. A
                     four-post bedstead, that looked as if it might have been made prior to the
                     Revolution, stood in one corner, and on this was a plethoric feather bed,
                     covered with a patchwork quilt. The rest of the furniture consisted of four
                     Windsor chairs; a tall, three-legged toilet-table, covered with a white cloth,
                     whereon rested a new toilet-glass, the price of which was somewhere in the
                     neighbourhood of fifty cents; and a small, stained pine-table, or stand for
                     holding a washhand-basin and pitcher. The floor was covered with a
                     rag-carpet.
                  "This is our best room," said the farmer's wife, with the tone and manner of
                     one who felt some pride in her housekeeping.
                  After Jenkins had fully surveyed the apartment, he was shown a small chamber adjoining, that
                     covered the entry. Above were two garret-rooms, each one half the size of the
                     "best room."
                  "Of course," said Mrs. Crabtree, "your two youngest children sleep in the room
                     with you."
                  Jenkins assented to this.
                  "Two could sleep in the little room over the entry, and two in one of the
                     garrets, while your servant could have the other garret all to herself."
                  This was a very nice arrangement. It seemed as if the house had been built for
                     the especial accommodation of Jenkins's family; though it must be confessed
                     that Mr. Jenkins did not feel very much flattered by the apparent foresight of
                     the builder.
                  "What are your terms?" next inquired Mr. Jenkins.
                  "Five dollars for grown persons, and three for children and servants," was the
                     ready answer.
                  "Rather a high price for such accommodations," said Jenkins.
                  This remark was not at all relished by the farmer's wife, who was about making
                     a tart reply, but was restrained by a glance from her more prudent husband, who
                     said—
                  "We might take your family for thirty dollars."
                  Jenkins was by no means tempted, and hesitated not to say that he did not think
                     their terms would suit him. The Crabtrees then retraced a little, and finally
                     agreed to take the family for twenty-five dollars.
                  "Your rooms are too small," said Jenkins.
                  "They're a very fair size, contended the farmer's wife. "And, moreover," she
                     added, "you don't expect to stay in your rooms all the time. People come into
                     the country to get fresh air. Your children will live out of doors."
                  The house stood on rising ground, and commanded a very fine view. To this the
                     farmer called the attention of Jenkins, who was charmed with the prospect. Then
                     the farmer praised every thing appertaining to the place. The water was the
                     best within five miles, and there wasn't a healthier situation to be found. His
                     wife was one of the best cooks in the world, and kindness itself.
                  So earnest was the farmer in his laudations, that Jenkins began to doubt the
                     evidence of his own eyes, and at length came to think that he had found a very
                     desirable location. Finally he went away, promising to bring his wife out to
                     look at the place. As he rode homeward, and saw along the way one elegant seat
                     after another, the few attractions he had observed in the farm-house entirely
                     faded from his imagination. Still, he did not make an altogether unfavourable
                     report, though he spoke in rather qualified terms.
                  Three or four more days were passed in looking after a suitable place for the
                     family to rusticate in for a couple of months; but nothing offered that had not
                     some objection of too serious a nature to be overcome.
                  "I don't see what we are to do, unless we take that place on the West Chester
                     road," said Jenkins, discouraged at last in his efforts to find country
                     boarding. "There'll be one advantage. We'll have the house all to ourselves.
                     It's a secluded place, and the children will be safe."
                  "You said the rooms were small," remarked Mrs. Jenkins, glancing around the
                     large, airy, handsomely furnished chamber in which they were seated.
                  "Yes: they are rather small. But that is the case generally, at least so far as
                     the chambers are concerned, in country houses. Suppose you ride out with me
                     tomorrow and look at the place?"
                  "Do you think it worth while for me to do so?" asked Mrs. Jenkins. "You have
                     been there, and can judge of it as well as I can."
                  "It seems to be that or nothing," said Jenkins.
                  "Then you'd better go out and secure it for the season. We only want boarding
                     for a couple of months, and things will have to be bad indeed, if we can't
                     endure them for that length of time. The main thing is to get our children into
                     the country during the holidays, and give them a breath of pure air and a
                     chance to run."
                  So it was concluded to engage boarding with Farmer Crabtree, which was
                     immediately done.
               
               
                  
                  PART II.
                  Trying the Experiment.
                  IT was a happy day in the house when Mr. Jenkins made known the fact that he
                     had secured summer boarding with Farmer Crabtree; for every mind, natural
                     enough to think, was filled with pleasant anticipations. Dick and Tom were
                     almost wild with delight, and Mrs. Jenkins felt so excited about the matter
                     that she hardly knew what to do with herself.
                  "How much we shall enjoy the summer!" said the latter over and over again.
                     "What a change from hot, sweltering walls to cool and pleasant woods and
                     fields! From the stifling, stagnant air of a crowded city to a pure and breezy
                     atmosphere! And, then, I shall feel so relieved about the children. Tom and
                     Dick will have a free range."
                  "Above all," would remark the husband, "we shall secure health, that greatest
                     of all blessings."
                  Here was the broadest resting-place for Mr. Jenkins, as his thoughts went on
                     toward the untried future—the future of country boarding. That somebody would
                     be disappointed, he had serious misgivings; but health would compensate for any
                     drawbacks to personal comfort which might happen to arise; and that such
                     drawbacks would come he felt too well assured, as the image of that little
                     house and its little rooms stood forth distinctly before the eyes of his
                     mind.
                  Well, in due time the family of Mr. Jenkins was ready for its summer migration.
                     Carpets had been taken up and packed away in tobacco, little valuables
                     distributed, for safe keeping, among friends not so fortunate as themselves
                        A Remonstrance.
                     
                      selves in being able to escape from
                     the city, and all the varied necessary arrangements for leaving the town-house
                     completed. The superintendence of all this, with a great part of the actual
                     labour, fell upon Mrs. Jenkins, who was, by the time every thing was ready for
                     the move, so completely worn down with fatigue that she could hardly stand.
                  It was late in the afternoon of one of the hottest and most oppressive days of
                     the season, that Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins, a domestic, and four children (Dick and
                     Tom had gone out in the morning in a furniture wagon, by which had been sent
                     trunks of clothing and a few articles of furniture,) took their seats in a
                     carriage and started for their summer retreat.
                  "Oh, how my head does ache!" said Mrs. Jenkins, placing her hand upon her
                     forehead. "It has ached all day as if it would burst. I really feel sick."
                  "You have over-fatigued yourself. The day has been excessively hot, and you
                     have worked too hard. But a season of rest and renovation is before you."
                  "And thankful I am for it. How glad I shall feel when I can lay my head upon my
                     pillow to-night, far away from the heat and noise and stifling airs of the
                     city!"
                  The carriage was moving on briskly, and it was not long before they were over
                     the bridge and beyond West Philadelphia, with the country all around them.
                  "How beautiful!" exclaimed Mrs. Jenkins, as they passed one of the neatest and
                     most highly improved places on the road.
                  "It is indeed very beautiful," returned Mr. Jenkins, half sighing as he spoke;
                     for, in strong contrast came up in his imagination the really unimproved,
                     comfortless, and uninviting domicil of Farmer Crabtree, and he felt that in the
                     mind of Mrs. Jenkins were types and shadows of things in country life not to be
                     realized.
                  "Beautiful! very beautiful!" came from the lips of Mrs. Jenkins, as one
                     handsomely improved residence after another was passed. "How much I shall enjoy
                     myself!" she would add, every now and then. "I always liked the country."
                  
                  After turning off from the main road, Mrs. Jenkins ceased her admiring remarks
                     and leaned back in the carriage. They had ridden about half a mile farther, and
                     were near the old cherry-tree pointed out to Mr. Jenkins on his first visit to
                     that neighbourhood, when the lady said, as she glanced from the
                     carriage-window—
                  "That's a mean-looking place."
                  The eyes of Mr. Jenkins followed the direction taken by those of his wife, and
                     rested on the not very attractive residence of Farmer Crabtree. Even less
                     attractive than before did it now appear in his eyes. He did not reply to his
                     wife's remark; for he could not find it in his heart to tell her the truth: and
                     yet the truth must come, and that right speedily.
                  "Turn off here," said Mr. Jenkins to the driver as they reached the old
                     cherry-tree.
                  "That isn't the place!" came, in a quick voice of surprise and disappointment
                     from the lips of Mrs. Jenkins, as she leaned from the carriage-window, and took
                     in, at a glance, all the beauties of the farm-house.
                  "Yes; this is the place!" returned Mr. Jenkins, with assumed cheerfulness. "You
                     have the worst view from this point," he added, in a tone of apology.
                  Mrs. Jenkins made no further remark, but sank back in the carriage, while a
                     shadow came stealing over her face.
                  "How my head does ache!" she murmured, a few minutes afterward.
                  Arrived at last, the family descended from the carriage, and were received by
                     Mr. and Mrs. Crabtree with all due formality. Poor Mrs. Jenkins tried to be
                     cheerful and look pleased. But it was a vain effort. She was really sick—sick,
                     as well from disappointment as from exhaustion and fatigue. And this was the
                     nice farm-house where she was to spend the summer so delightfully!
                  "Will you show me our room?" asked Mrs. Jenkins, soon after their entrance.
                  Mrs. Crabtree conducted her to the room which had been duly set apart as the
                     one she was to occupy with her husband, and, as she entered it, remarked—
                  "I think you will find it very comfortable here, ma'am. This is our spare
                     room."
                  The eyes of Mrs. Jenkins were thrown around the apartment eagerly.
                  "It's very small," was her only remark.
                  "We think it quite a sizeable room," returned Mrs. Crabtree, in a voice that
                     showed a slight movement of displeasure.
                  "Will you ask my husband to come up?" said Mrs. Jenkins.
                  "Certainly, ma'am." And Mrs. Crabtree left the room.
                  When Mr. Jenkins entered the chamber, he found his wife sitting near one of the
                     windows with her bonnet still on.
                  "Can't they give us a larger room than this?" she asked.
                  "No, my dear. It's the largest chamber in the house," replied Mr. Jenkins.
                  "We can never breathe in a closet like this. I feel suffocated already. How
                     close and impure the air is!"
                  Mr. Jenkins raised two of the windows that were closed.
                  "Rag carpet! Ugh! I never could bear rag carpets!" now muttered Mrs. Jenkins,
                     as she cast her eyes upon the floor. Then she looked toward the narrow,
                     mountain-like bed, and, instantly rising, threw herself upon it, sinking, as
                     she did so, some two feet among the feathers.
                  "A feather bed, as I live! Goodness! I can never sleep on that."
                  "We'll tell them to give us a mattrass," said Mr. Jenkins, calmly.
                  "Ten chances to one if they have such a thing in the house," replied Mrs.
                     Jenkins.
                  And so it proved; for the chances were all against the mattrass.
                  "Oh dear! oh dear!" murmured poor Mrs. Jenkins.
                  "If this is one of the pleasures of country boarding, and there are to be many
                     more of the same kind, we will have a delightful time of it."
                  "We're here now, and must try and make the best we can of it," replied Mr.
                     Jenkins. "You will soon get used to
                     little inconveniences. Health, pure air, and a free range for the children are
                     the main things. We cannot expect all the comforts and elegancies of a city
                     residence."
                  Mrs. Jenkins sighed. For a little while longer she remained half irresolute.
                     She was seriously considering the propriety of going back forthwith to the
                     city. Then she quietly laid aside her bonnet, and began to make preparations to
                     remain. Nearly her first act was to go to the washstand for the purpose of
                     laving her hands and face in cool water. But the pitcher was empty. No, not
                     exactly empty; for in the bottom lay a dead bird, from which came a strong
                     decaying odour as she lifted the pitcher from its place in the basin.
                  "Nice preparations for boarders," said the lady fretfully, "and a pleasant
                     earnest of things to come. I wish you would go down and tell Hannah to bring up
                     Mary and Edward."
                  Mr. Jenkins did as desired. From that time until tea was ready, Mrs. Jenkins
                     was busy with the children and other little matters of preparation. During this
                     period Tom and Dick had come in with red, sunburnt faces, and clothes soiled to
                     an extent that almost agonized the mother, who was a woman, be it known, who
                     had "an eye for dirt." They had found a running stream near by, and also a
                     good-sized pond. Between damming the stream and sailing on old planks on the
                     pond, they had managed to pass a delightful day, at the expense of a good deal
                     of suffering on the part of their clothes.
                  At tea-time, Mrs. Crabtree looked grave. Her first impressions in regard to
                     Mrs. Jenkins were not good. Mrs. Jenkins was quite as favourably impressed in
                     regard to herself.
                  "Have you a mattrass?" asked Mrs. Jenkins, while they yet sat at the
                     tea-table.
                  "A mattrass!" Mrs. Crabtree did not comprehend the meaning of the question.
                  "Yes. I never sleep on a feather bed."
                  "Oh! a mattrass! No, ma'am. We haven't a mattrass. But you'll find that a very
                     nice, comfortable bed. It has in it over seventy pounds of the very best
                     feathers."
                  "I would die before morning!" said Mrs. Jenkins, with little effort to hide her
                     feelings. "I will thank you to have the bed removed, and we will sleep on the
                     sacking to-night. To-morrow we can have a mattrass brought out."
                  "There is no sacking-bottom to the bed," replied Mrs. Crabtree. "It is
                     corded."
                  "Corded!"
                  "Yes, ma'am."
                  "Oh dear! Then what shall we do? I'd rather sleep on the floor than on that
                     feather bed."
                  "It's a good, clean feather bed, ma'am," said Mrs. Crabtree, an indignant flush
                     in her face and an indignant tone in her voice. She did not yet fully
                     comprehend the objection of Mrs. Jenkins.
                  "We do not in the least doubt that," said Mr. Jenkins, who saw that their
                     landlady's mind was somewhat in the dark. The feather bed is all that one could
                     desire; but we never sleep on any thing but a mattrass, winter or summer.
                     Perhaps you have a straw bed?"
                  "Oh yes. There is a good straw one under the feather bed.
                  "Just the thing!" replied Mr. Jenkins. "Take away the feather bed, and we'll do
                     very well."
                  So that difficulty was settled.
                  The night that followed proved to be a most sultry one. The youngest child lay
                     in a crib beside the bed, on which reclined—we will not say slept—Mr. and Mrs.
                     Jenkins with another child. On the side next the crib were two windows; but
                     neither of them could be left open, because the crib was not three feet from
                     them, and what little air was stirring came from that quarter, and it was not
                     safe to let it blow on little Mary, who was subject to croup. Into the other
                     two windows, at the foot of the bed, which were partly raised, came not a
                     breath to fan into something like living motion the sluggish air of the
                     chamber.
                  Not for years had Mrs. Jenkins slept without a light in her chamber. But she
                     was doomed to make the experiment on this occasion. Such a thing as an oil lamp
                     there was not in the house. A long tallow candle was lit on retiring to bed,
                     with the hope that it would burn all night. Twice had Mr. Jenkins been roused
                     by his wife from a transient doze,
                     once to snuff this candle, and once to remove a fragment of wick that was
                     causing it to "gutter" at a most alarming rate.
                  "I wish you would see what o'clock it is," said the restless lady, arousing her
                     husband for the third time. "It can't be long from morning."
                  "It's just one o'clock," replied Mr. Jenkins, as he brought his watch to the
                     candle.
                  "Only one o'clock! It will never be daylight!" exclaimed Mrs. Jenkins.
                  "Try and get to sleep," said Mr. Jenkins.
                  "Sleep! There isn't a wink of sleep in me. There! What is that?"
                  Mrs. Jenkins raised herself up as a bird flew in at the window, and commenced
                     dancing about the room.
                  "It's a bat. Take care!" replied Mr. Jenkins. "Don't let it fall on your head.
                     They bite terribly."
                  This was enough to cause Mrs. Jenkins to drop down as if shot, and bury her
                     face in the clothes. Mr. Jenkins lay for a minute or two, watching the bird as
                     it flew about the room. Then rising, he tried to drive it out. While engaged in
                     this interesting employment, the bat darted against the candle, and instantly
                     the room was in darkness. Here was a dilemma! There were no matches at hand,
                     and Mrs. Jenkins was afraid to let her husband go down-stairs to relight the
                     candle. To add to the perplexity of the moment, little Mary awoke and commenced
                     crying for a drink of water. Feeling his way in the dark, Mr. Jenkins succeeded
                     in finding the pitcher, and, after a further search of nearly a minute, made
                     out to turn up a tumbler. Twice, during the time occupied in this effort, the
                     bat swept so close to his face that its wings brushed his cheek. At length a
                     glass of water was brought to the child's lips, and she ceased crying and
                     commenced drinking. But only a mouthful or two had been taken, ere she pushed
                     the glass away and spouted the water from her mouth, saying that there was
                     something in the water. Eyes being of no use under the circumstances, Mrs.
                     Jenkins thrust her fingers into the tumbler, and found, to her horror, as many
                     as two or three bugs therein, about the size of grains of coffee.
                  "Oh, mercy!" she exclaimed, "Mary has swallowed a bug, as sure as the world!
                     The tumbler is full of them."
                  At this Mary began to cry afresh—the words of her mother had frightened her—and
                     she continued to cry for the next hour. That was a night long to be remembered
                     by Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. It seemed to them as if daylight would never come.
                     Dripping with perspiration, and almost suffocated in the dark, close, sultry
                     air, they lay murmuring over their discomfort until morning. As for Mrs.
                     Jenkins, she declared, unequivocally, she would not remain in that place a day
                     longer. But, after the sun had arisen, a sober consultation was held, in which
                     all the pros and cons were fully discussed. The result was a decision to remain a
                     week or two at least, and give the place a trial. But, in order to do this, it
                     was determined that Mr. Jenkins should send out, on that very day, a mattrass,
                     gauze frames for the windows, to keep out bats and bugs at night, oil for a
                     lamp, matches, and some dozen other articles that were now seen to be
                     indispensable.
                  At breakfast-time the family met at the table in the small dining-room. Bread
                     and butter, fried bacon, and coffee composed the meal. Mr. Crabtree was absent;
                     he had started for the city with his marketing before daylight, taking with him
                     all the fresh-laid eggs and new-made butter, which were to be served to a
                     boarding-house with which he had a contract for the supply of these articles.
                     The butter on the table was scarcely eatable; at which Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins
                     somewhat wondered. As for the coffee, it was poor, watery stuff, and the
                     "cream" with which Mrs. Crabtree sought to improve its quality was nothing more
                     nor less than skim-milk.
                  The meal passed in silence, and then Mr. Jenkins started for the city. He had
                     to walk half a mile in order to meet the stage. In the afternoon, having sent
                     out the mattrass and other things needed for their comfort, he left in the
                     stage.
                  There were heavy masses of clouds in the west, which Mr. Jenkins did not
                     observe until after leaving the city. He did not, therefore, provide himself
                     with an umbrella. Blacker and blacker grew these clouds, and by the time he had to leave the stage they had
                     curtained the whole heavens. Mr. Jenkins, fearful of being caught in a summer
                     shower, hurried on his way; but he had not gone half the distance from the
                     turnpike to Mr. Crabtree's, before down came the rain in a perfect torrent. He
                     sought the shelter of a tree, after getting soaked to the skin, and stood there
                     for a whole hour. But still it rained on, while the lightning flashed vividly,
                     and the thunder rolled with an almost incessant jar. At last, beginning to feel
                     chilled in his wet garments, Mr. Jenkins concluded that it would be best for
                     him to get home; so off he started, in the face of the driving storm, along a
                     road now ankle deep in some places with mud.
                  On arriving at the house, Nero, who either did not know him, or affected
                     ignorance on the subject, made a dash at him, as on a former occasion, and this
                     time got a good mouthful out of his pantaloons before he was called off by
                     Farmer Crabtree, who gave the dog a sound thrashing for his over-watchfulness.
                     For this Mr. Jenkins was not forgiven by Nero, who rarely ever suffered him to
                     get peaceably into the house on his daily return from the city.
                  That night was a more comfortable one for Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins, as the storm
                     cooled the atmosphere, and they had better sleeping arrangements than at first.
                     But, on the next morning, Mr. Jenkins found himself suffering from an attack of
                     rheumatism—an old friend of his, for whom he had no very particular regard.
                  It took over a week for the family of Mr. Jenkins to get sufficiently well
                     acquainted with things around them to understand exactly their true position.
                     By this time they had seen a little deeper into the economical arrangements of
                     the Crabtrees; but not deep enough to enable them to comprehend why, being in
                     the country, and on a farm, they should have so few of the luxuries confidently
                     anticipated. But on this head they were in due time enlightened.
                  "I know the reason," said Tom, the oldest boy, to his mother, after they had
                     been in the country about two weeks, "why we never have good butter."
                  "Well, what is the reason?" asked Mrs. Jenkins.
                  "They send it all to market."
                  "Not all. Some is kept back for the family."
                  "Indeed, then, and not a pound is kept back," said Tom. "Mr. Crabtree takes all
                     they make to town, and sells it for thirty-five cents, and then buys butter for
                     us at a quarter. Mrs. Crabtree says it's good enough for boarders."
                  "How do you know?" inquired Mrs. Jenkins.
                  "I heard her say so."
                  "Are you certain?"
                  "Indeed I am. And all the fresh eggs are taken to market, too. The fact is,
                     they take every thing to market. You know the two nice pears I bought you the
                     other day. Well, Mr. Crabtree scolded Dick and me like every thing because we
                     knocked some of them from the tree, and said it was no better than stealing.
                     Yesterday he stripped the tree, and to-day all the fruit was taken to market.
                     It's too bad. I don't like it at all. I thought when I came to the country, I'd
                     get plenty of fruit; but I've hardly had a taste."
                  When Mr. Jenkins came home that evening, his wife was able to enlighten him on
                     the subject of bad butter.
                  "Can this really be true?" asked that gentleman, in an incredulous tone of
                     voice. "Send their good butter to market and buy bad for us, when we are paying
                     them twenty-five dollars a week? I'll see about that."
                  On the next morning, at breakfast-time, Mr. Jenkins said, after tasting the
                     butter, and then replacing the small portion he had taken upon the
                     butter-plate—
                  "The fact is, Mr. Crabtree, I can't eat your butter. You must have very bad
                     grass, very bad cows, or else be very bad butter-makers."
                  The faces of both Mr. and Mrs. Crabtree coloured at this unexpected remark.
                     They had good grass, good cows, and were good butter-makers, and they knew it;
                     the allegation of Mr. Jenkins, therefore, touched them to the quick.
                  "This isn't our butter," was stammered out in some confusion by Mrs.
                     Crabtree.
                  "Not your butter!" exclaimed Mr. Jenkins, in affected surprise. "Oh, I was not
                     aware of that. Pray, then, let us have a taste of yours for this is execrable
                     stuff."
                  
                  Mrs. Crabtree could do no less than order a print of her nice yellow butter to
                     be brought upon the table.
                  "Ah! that is butter!" said Mr. Jenkins, as he tasted it.
                  The way nearly a pound print disappeared was distressing to the eyes of Mr. and
                     Mrs. Crabtree.
                  After breakfast Jenkins took the farmer aside.
                  "Mr. Crabtree," said he, "how is it that you have been giving us such miserable
                     butter, when your own is of good quality? I don't understand it."
                  "All my butter is engaged in the city," replied the farmer.
                  "It is?"
                  "Yes, sir; and I must serve my customers."
                  "And all your eggs, too?"
                  "Yes, sir."
                  "So I had begun to think, not having seen a fresh egg on the table since I have
                     been here. All your cream is made into butter?"
                  "It is."
                  "I now understand why our coffee is so poor. Well, Mr. Crabtree, all I have to
                     say is, there will have to be an immediate reform, or you will lose twenty-five
                     dollars a week. Perhaps it pays you better to sell your butter and eggs than to
                     feed them to your boarders. If so, go on with your system, and we will go back
                     to the city. We pay you for the best of every thing, and the best we must have.
                     So now you understand me."
                  There was, of course, quite a buzzing in the Crabtree hive. But when the farmer
                     and his wife made a calculation of loss and gain on the butter-selling and
                     butter-feeding operations, they wisely concluded to adopt the latter
                     system.
                  After that the Jenkinses fared a little better. Still, as to real comfort, they
                     had nothing of the article. In the daytime the sun poured his rays all around
                     the little, unprotected farm-house, keeping Mrs. Jenkins and the younger
                     children in-doors or confined to a narrow range without, and night shut them up
                     in small, close rooms, where it seemed almost impossible to breathe. Once or
                     twice every week Mr. Jenkins missed the stage, and had to walk in the hot sun
                     to West Philadelphia for an omnibus bus. And every now and then he was drenched
                     with rain in going from the stage to the farm-house. Dick and Tom were about
                     the only ones who really enjoyed themselves, and they managed every day to get
                     their clothes in a condition that completely horrified their mother.
                  Until the latter part of August this country comfort was endured, when, on
                     returning from the city one evening, Mr. Jenkins found two of the children,
                     Dick and Mary, quite sick. They had considerable fever, and Dick was a little
                     out of his head. About a mile away lived a doctor, who was summoned
                     immediately.
                  "What do you think ails them?" asked Mrs. Jenkins, after the doctor had
                     examined the children.
                  "They have intermittent fever, I presume," replied the physician.
                  "Intermittent fever!" ejaculated Mrs. Jenkins.
                  "Intermittent fever!" said the father.
                  "No doubt of it. It is prevailing about here to a great extent," replied the
                     doctor.
                  "Oh dear!" sighed Mrs. Jenkins. "Has it come to this? So much for country
                     boarding!"
                  "It isn't always prudent to come into the country at this season," remarked the
                     doctor.
                  "I had no idea that it was sickly about here," said Mr. Jenkins.
                  "It isn't ordinarily. But there is a good deal of intermittent and bilious
                     fever just at this time."
                  "We must go back immediately!" said Mrs. Jenkins.
                  "Yes, immediately!" added her husband.
                  And so, on the next day, the Jenkinses made a precipitate flight to the city,
                     with two sick children.
               
               
                  
                  PART III.
                  The Sequel.
                  ONE of the hottest of August's hot days was that on which Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins
                     returned home with their family. Their flight from the country took place, as
                     did their flight from the city, late in the afternoon.
                  "Thank Heaven, that experiment is over!" exclaimed Mrs. Jenkins, as the
                     carriage in which she had taken her seat began to move from the door of Farmer
                     Crabtree.
                  "Country boarding! Save the mark!" muttered Mr. Jenkins, in an under tone.
                  "Oh, how glad I shall be to get home again with my poor children!" added Mrs.
                     Jenkins. Dear Mary! How sick she is! Ah me! I'm afraid we shall pay dear for
                     our experiment."
                  "A change of air and good medical attendance will bring all right again, I
                     hope," remarked Mr. Jenkins.
                  "I have my fears," said Mrs. Jenkins, with a sigh. "Mrs. Wheeler's Milly got
                     the chills year before last somewhere up the Schuylkill, and was sick all
                     winter. Poor little fellow! He suffered a great deal. Just to think that our
                     children, who have always been so healthy, should get such a miserable
                     disease!"
                  "If this is summer boarding," said Mr. Jenkins, breaking the silence a little
                     while afterward, "save me from a second trial of its pleasures!"
                  "Such a life as I have lived for the last six weeks! Gracious! What would
                     induce me to go over it again?" remarked Mrs. Jenkins. "Shut up from all
                     society in that little den, upon which the sun poured down from morning till
                     night with melting fervour, and deprived of
                        A Sequel to Country Boarding.
                     
                      almost every thing made necessary to
                     my comfort by habit, I have merely endured existence. And then, we have all
                     lived like heathens. For six weeks neither I nor the children have seen the
                     inside of a church. As for Tom and Dick, they have run perfectly wild, and
                     learned more low slang, and, I fear, vice, from the farm hands and boys about
                     the neighbourhood than they would have learned in the city for years."
                  Mr. Jenkins sighed at this strong array of evils attendant on their
                     summer-boarding experiment. Nor had he escaped without some pretty serious
                     inroads upon his personal comfort, to say nothing of the return of his old
                     friend the rheumatism, brought back by more than one drenching in a
                     thunder-shower. Quite as glad was he as his wife to quit the scene of their
                     rural felicity.
                  "Oh! this is delightful!" exclaimed Mrs. Jenkins, sitting down near an open
                     window in a large, airy chamber, soon after arriving at home. Hot as the day
                     had been, and sultry as the atmosphere still remained, there was yet a cool
                     draft of air passing through the chambers, in one of which Mrs. Jenkins was
                     seated. "How foolish we were to give up real comfort like this!" she added.
                  "And for what?" said her husband.
                  "Yes, and for what? You may well ask that question."
                  "Oh, Mrs. Jenkins!" cried the nurse at this moment, in a voice of alarm, "what
                     is the matter with Mary?"
                  Mary's chill had come on just as the family was leaving Farmer Crabtree's. It
                     was more violent than the preceding ones, and was succeeded by a very high
                     fever, which, commenced rising before they reached the city.
                  The startling words of the nurse caused Mrs. Jenkins to go hurriedly into the
                     adjoining chamber, where Mary lay upon a bed.
                  "What is the matter?" she asked anxiously.
                  "Oh, Mrs. Jenkins! See how she looks!" said the nurse. "Her eyes are set, and
                     she keeps twisting her face and working her body so strangely.
                  "Oh, mercy! Mr. Jenkins! Run for the doctor, quickly! What is the matter?"
                  Mr. Jenkins, who had hurried in after his wife, exclaimed, as soon as he looked
                     at the child—
                  
                  "Bless me! She's in convulsions!"
                  "Convulsions! Oh, dear! What shall we do? Oh, Mr. Jenkins, run, run for the
                     doctor!"
                  And the frightened mother, who had never seen a child in convulsions, wrung her
                     hands like one distracted.
                  "Get her into a hot bath as quickly as possibly," said Mr. Jenkins, assuming a
                     calm exterior, although he felt much alarmed, "and I will go for the doctor.
                     Make the water as hot as your hand can bear it, and keep her in for a good
                     while. I will be back very soon."
                  And saying this, Mr. Jenkins hurried away. A quarter of an hour elapsed before
                     he returned with a physician; and full three hours passed ere the dreadful
                     spasms that convulsed the frame of the child subsided.
                  On the next day, the chill returned, succeeded by another raging fever. With an
                     anxious heart did the mother sit by Mary's bedside, hour after hour watching
                     eagerly the little sufferer's face, and trembling all the while lest there
                     should be another return of convulsions. Happily there was no recurrence of
                     these frightful symptoms; but the poor child's system was so shocked by the
                     first attack that she remained in a partial stupor for two or three days,
                     giving rise to the fear that her brain had received some permanent injury.
                     This, however, was not the case. Still the fever held on with a clinging
                     tenacity, that for a time defied all the efforts of medicine. Week after week,
                     both in the case of Dick and Mary, there was a daily return of the chill and
                     fever, until the natural strength of good constitutions began to fail under the
                     pressure of disease and the debilitating effects of strong and active
                     remedies.
                  Frost, so long and anxiously looked for, as having power to break the chills,
                     came; but the only difference in the state of the young sufferers was, that a
                     tertian ague took the place of daily chills and fevers. This continued until
                     Christmas, when, with a feeling of thankfulness that they could not express,
                     the parents saw the fever leave their children. But troublesome consequences
                     remained. Poor little Mary was swollen around her waist to a third beyond her
                     usual size; and the doctor gave Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins the not very consoling
                     information that one or two years might pass before she was entirely recovered
                     from the bad effects that too often follow attacks of ague and fever. Moreover,
                     both she and Dick would be liable to a return of the disease in the ensuing
                     fall.
                  Alone with the children did not rest the evil consequences of this
                     country-boarding experiment. Rheumatic twitches, aches, and pains, the result
                     of sundry exposures to drenching rains, took a more serious character in the
                     case of Mr. Jenkins as cold weather made its approaches; and before winter was
                     fairly over, he had to take his place in his chamber, and endure the pangs of a
                     four weeks' visitation of inflammatory rheumatism.
                  "Are you going to the country this summer?" said a friend to Mr. Jenkins, early
                     in June last.
                  "For what?" asked Jenkins, rather tartly.
                  "Why, for comfort."
                  "Comfort!"
                  "Yes. For comfort during the hot months."
                  "Yes. I engaged a place at a snug little farm-house yesterday."
                  "Hope you may find more comfort than we did last year," said Jenkins.
                  "Ain't you going?"
                  "Not we. One season cured us of our country-boarding aspirations; and you will
                     be cured ere September, if you get as snugly fixed as we were at farmer
                     Crabtree's."
                  "Crabtree's! There's where we are going," said the friend.
                  "Is it, indeed ! Well, all I can say is that you'd better stay at home."
                  At this, the friend had a dozen or more questions to ask; and Mr. Jenkins was
                     in no way choice of his words in answering them. We have only to add that
                     farmer Crabtree was not successful in filling his house with boarders last
                     summer.
                  Of course, all who go into the country are not so thoroughly disappointed as
                     were Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins, though few are fortunate enough to realize their
                     pleasant anticipations. Going away from home for comfort, either in summer or
                     winter, is not the most certain way of securing the object desired.
               
            
            
               
               
                  
               
               LARGE STORIES.
               "WONDERFUL!" exclaimed one of a group of listeners, who were hanging on the words
                  of a moustached, whiskered, out-at-the-elbows-looking fellow, who had evidently
                  seen something of the world, though clearly to no great advantage to himself. "As
                  large as your fist?"
               "Yes, sir!" replied the relater.
               "Solid gold?"
               "Solid and pure as an ingot. Why, I saw a man from one of the 'diggins' on Feather
                  River, with a raw-hide sack that would hold half a bushel, full of lumps that he
                  had gathered in a little over ten days; not one of which was smaller than a
                  walnut."
               "You don't say so!" fell from two or three voices.
               "It is just what I do say."
               "Had you any luck in digging?" inquired one.
               "Certainly I had. I staid only a month in the 'diggins,' and came down to
                  Sacramento with over twenty thousand dollars' worth of the real stuff."
               "Twenty thousand!"
               "Yes, and over."
               "What did you do with your gold?" asked one.
               Whiskerendo shrugged his shoulders, compressed suddenly his lips, and elevated his
                  eyebrows.
               "Come easy, go easy;" said he. "It was spent in a month after I reached the
                  sea-coast."
               "What did you do then?"
               "Got a situation as clerk in a store, at three hundred dollars a month."
               "Good wages," remarked one of the listeners.
               "First rate. Grand place, that California. A man's a fool to plod out his life
                  here."
               "So I should think, provided you are not romancing," said one of the company.
               "Romancing! There's no need to romance, my friend," returned the adventurer. "The
                  simple truth is wonderful enough. In fact, the half has never been told; and, I
                  believe, never will be told. The riches of that El Dorado are scarcely yet opened.
                  Take my advice, every one of you, and make all haste for this golden region. There
                  is room enough left for thousands to work and secure untold riches."
               Among the listeners was an old fellow named Grimes, who had said nothing, but who
                  had occasionally let his eye rest upon the talker with a half-sarcastic,
                  half-comical twinkle.
               "See here, my friend," said California, drawing up a chair to the table at which
                  this personage was sitting, and addressing him in a familiar way, "why don't you
                  pull up stakes, and travel off to this land of promise? A man's a fool to vegetate
                  in this part of the country, pursuing
                  suing the vanishing shadow of a fortune, when he has only to step across the
                  isthmus, glide up the coast, and fill his pockets with a hundred or two thousands
                  of dollars in a few months."
               "That can be easily done, can it?" said the old fellow.
               "Pho! I washed ten thousand dollars out of a few bushels of sand in a single
                  day."
               "You did?"
               "Certainly. Any body can do it."
               "Then why didn't you stay there, my friend?" coolly asked the other.
               Whiskerendo shrugged his shoulders, arched his eyebrows, pursed his lips, and made
                  sundry other dumb motions.
               "You seem to be pretty well out at the elbows, and pretty well out in the pocket,"
                  continued the other. "Where are all these heaps of shining gold you talk so much
                  about?"
               "Come easy, go easy;" and California shrugged his shoulders again. "Spent ten
                  thousand dollars in Sacramento city in a fortnight. Great place, that."
               "Why didn't you go back to the mines again?"
               "Didn't like the company there. Horrible place!"
               "Oho! And yet, a moment since, you pictured it as the most desirable spot on the
                  earth! But why didn't you stay in Sacramento, on a salary of three hundred dollars
                  a month, eh? Tell us that, my friend. You can't make three hundred dollars a year,
                  I fancy, in these diggins'!"
               "Do you mean to insult me, sir?" exclaimed California, at this, growing fierce,
                  and beginning to finger his moustache. "I never permit a man to insult me."
               "I only asked a very natural question," coolly replied the interrogator, without
                  moving, or taking his eyes from the other's face. "You're not the first man I've
                  seen from the gold region, who came back with empty pockets and large stories. I
                  always ask such adventurers why they didn't stay there, but have yet to receive an
                  answer to my question. Pray, sir, gratify my curiosity."
               California couldn't stand this; the more especially as one and another of the
                  group he had been edifying, repeated the interrogation. So he took refuge under a
                  torrent of bad language, and retired from the company in high indignation.
               "I can tell you why he left," said one, who had, until now, been silent.
               "Why?" "Why?" was repeated all around.
               "You know him, do you not?"
               "Yes." "Yes." "Charles—."
               The man drew a letter from his pocket and read—
               "You remember Charles—. Well, he left in the last steamer for Panama, and took
                  with him some three or four thousand dollars in gold dust, belonging to a friend.
                  He's a bad man, and conducted himself scandalously while here. It would hardly do
                  for him to return."
               "Hum-m-m!" "Oho!" "Aha!" Such were the low ejaculations that followed this little
                  piece of information. "That explains his coming back."
               California never again appeared in that company, nor repeated his large stories in
                  the presence of old Grimes.
            
            
               
               "ANY THING OVER TO-DAY?"
               JENKINS was an honest, simple-minded man, little versed in the ways of the world.
                  Being without capital, and having a salary, as clerk in a mercantile house, only
                  sufficient for the support of himself and those dependent on him, no thought of
                  going into business entered his mind. A clerk he was, and a clerk he expected to
                  remain. One after another of his fellow-quilldrivers had broken through their
                  cerements, and arisen into the station and dignity of merchants; but he was still
                  at the desk, and anticipated no such change for himself. One day, a young man
                  named Tompkins, who had started out in life two or three years before, said to
                  him—
               "Jenkins, my old friend, why don't you go into business? You are wasting the best
                  years of your existence."
               Jenkins shrugged his shoulders, and half sighed the word
               "Capital!"
               "You don't need any capital," replied Tompkins.
               Jenkins elevated his eyebrows with a look of wonder.
               "Credit is capital," said Tompkins.
               "Oh! But where's the credit to come from?"
               "There are plenty of men who will sell you goods. I've never found any difficulty.
                  I started without a hundred dollars, and am now doing business to the amount of
                  fifty thousand dollars a year."
               "So much?"
               "Yes, every dollar of it; and, if my good luck goes on, I'll do seventy thousand
                  dollars worth next year.
               "And your only capital was your credit?"
               
                  
                     Anything over To-day?
                  
               
               
               "I hadn't a dollar in hard cash."
               "Possible?"
               "It's truth."
               "You bought on four and six months?"
               "Yes."
               "But a stock of goods can't be turned in six months. That's admitted on all
                  hands."
               "A good deal can be turned if a man pushes his business."
               "Suppose sixteen thousand out of twenty are turned—and that's a liberal
                  calculation—how are the four thousand to be made up?"
               "You must borrow."
               "Borrow?"
               "Yes."
               "It's easy enough to say 'Borrow,' but who's to lend?"
               "Every body lends. You are short to-day, and your neighbour is over—he lends you.
                  To-morrow he is short and you are over, and you lend him. Hundreds of thousands of
                  dollars circulate in this way."
               "But suppose my neighbour isn't over when I happen to be short?" said Jenkins.
               "Go to another neighbour. Somebody will be over. I have never found any
                  difficulty."
               "All that's too temporary, and a little too risky for me. The
                  borrowed amount must go on increasing until the sum becomes unmanageable."
               "By that time," replied Tompkins, "your credit will be so well established that
                  you can get an accommodation in bank. Money in business, you know, is always worth
                  its interest."
               "Yes, I am aware of that."
               "Borrowed capital is therefore just as good as if it were your own, for all
                  business purposes."
               Jenkins assented to this, although he didn't exactly feel that it was true.
               "Can this be readily done?" he inquired.
               "Certainly," was the confident answer. "I can do it."
               "I'm afraid I couldn't," said Jenkins.
               "Why not?"
               "Oh, I don't know; but that's my impression."
               
               "Nonsense; you can do it as well as any one else. You're too timid. Nothing
                  venture, nothing gain. Here you are, wearing out your life on a salary of a
                  thousand dollars, when you might just as well be making two or three thousand. Use
                  your abilities for your own benefit, not for the good of others, to be turned out
                  to die, like an old horse, when you get old."
               A few interviews like this with Tompkins, who manifested a warm interest for his
                  old friend, finally overcame all objections in the mind of Jenkins, and he became
                  possessed of go-into-business-and-get-rich spirits. Credit was capital. That was
                  an admitted axiom. And, with capital, any fool could make money. That was its twin
                  brother. Jenkins found less difficulty in obtaining goods on a six months' credit
                  than he had anticipated. He had a quiet, thoughtful air about him, and his old
                  employers gave him credit for being a man of the most honest purposes, and a good
                  knowledge of business.
               During the first six months Jenkins was able to discount many of his own notes.
                  This made his credit A No. 1 with a good many of the wholesale men from whom he
                  bought, and they congratulated him that he was getting on so well; but, at the
                  expiration of six months, when about six or seven thousand dollars fell due in the
                  course of a couple of weeks, Jenkins found his vessel passing from a smooth sea
                  into troubled waters.
               "Any thing over to-day, Jenkins?" or, "Will you have any thing over to-morrow?"
                  had been sounded in his ears half a dozen times daily for the last three or four
                  months; and he had made temporary loans of small sums again and again to his
                  neighbours. Tompkins had been a liberal borrower. He was on the street daily. It
                  was now Jenkins's turn to ask a reciprocation of favours, which had, thus far,
                  been all on one side.
               For the first notes which fell due, to the amount of two thousand five hundred
                  dollars, Jenkins was prepared; but one morning he found himself with a thousand
                  dollars to pay, and nothing in bank. The young merchant felt sober. This large
                  amount must be borrowed—but could he borrow it? That was the doubtful question.
                  Moreover, he felt a natural repugnance to asking favours of the kind, and his
                  heart sank in him at the very thought of doing so; but in no other way could the
                  money be raised. Temporary loans must be had until the regular sales brought all
                  right again. Business was very good, and profits fair. The prospect ahead was
                  encouraging. The present difficulty surmounted, and all would be smooth sailing
                  again.
               Naturally enough, Jenkins' first visit was to his friend. "Any thing over to-day,
                  Tompkins?" he asked, confidently—for here he fully counted on important aid. The
                  smile on the face of his friend instantly faded.
               "Not a cent, Jenkins, I'm sorry to say," was the reply. "I'm short two thousand
                  myself, and fully counted on you for five hundred."
               "I must raise a thousand to-day," said Jenkins, in a husky voice, and with every
                  sign of disappointment visible. "I fully counted on you."
               "If I should possibly have any thing over at two o'clock you will be most welcome
                  to it," said Tompkins; "but you musn't depend on me. No doubt you will raise what
                  you want easily enough. Have you tried Smith?"
               "Not yet."
               "You've accommodated him?"
               "Yes, twenty times."
               "Then go to him. I think he's flush to-day."
               To the store of Smith, Jenkins proceeded; but not with the easy confidence he
                  experienced in calling upon Tompkins. The first disappointment had dashed his
                  feelings. Smith was a spruce, active little fellow, who advanced to meet Jenkins,
                  rubbing his hands as the latter came in.
               "Ah, Jenkins, how are you—how are you?" said he, smiling like a prima donna. "I
                  was just about calling in to see you. Any thing over to-day?"
               Now this was almost too much for poor human nature; or, at least, for that of Mr.
                  Jenkins. His countenance, which had lighted up, fell; and he stammered out—
               "No, no, not a cent. The f-f-fact is, I'm on a borrowing tramp to-day, and have
                  come to ask a lift from you."
               "Indeed! I'm sorry I can't help you. Why, I thought you one of the most
                  comfortable men in the street."
               
               "So I have been. Never before asked for a dollar since I was in business. But
                  several heavy payments are crowded into this and next week, and I shall be short
                  for a time. It won't last long, however."
               "Wish I could help you, Jenkins. My will is good," said Smith; "but I must take
                  care of number one to-day. If I have any thing over to-morrow you shall be welcome
                  to it with all my heart. Have you tried Jones?"
               "No."
               "Call on him. He had in three or four customers from the West yesterday, and I
                  think they left him, as they say, 'a right smart chance' of money. He's borrowed
                  from you, I know."
               "Yes, often."
               "He'll help you. Call on him."
               "Any thing over to-day?" asked Jenkins, meekly, of Jones, whom he found at his
                  desk, looking particularly dismal.
               "No, not a red cent," sharply returned Jones, frowning as he spoke, and glancing
                  involuntarily toward a rack full of bank notices. He had been meditating for half
                  an hour before Jenkins came in, with these full in view; which fact will account
                  for his unamiable temper.
               Jenkins turned away without speaking, and went back to his own store. He had never
                  had just such feelings as now oppressed him. A thousand dollars were to be paid in
                  bank before three o'clock, and he had, thus far, nothing toward meeting the
                  obligation. Moreover, three thousand dollars additional fell due in the course of
                  a week, all of which must be met, or he would fail in business. "Fail!" How the
                  word, as it formed itself in his thoughts, made him tremble inwardly.
               "Where is the money to come from?" he sighed, as he seated himself in his store.
                  For ten minutes he remained inactive; then, suddenly rising, he murmured—
               "But this won't do. It must come from somewhere. I will try Wilkins; he's had many
                  favours of me."
               To Wilkins's store Jenkins repaired.
               "Any thing over to-day?" he asked, betraying in his voice and countenance the
                  extremity of his need.
               "Well—I don't—know," replied Wilkins, thoughtfully and deliberately. "Let me
                  see."
               And, opening his fire-closet, he took out a large pocketbook, and commenced
                  examining its contents.
               "How much do you want?" he at length asked.
               "Three or four hundred dollars."
               "Is it to go in bank?"
               "Yes."
               "If uncurrent money would answer, I might help you some."
               "How near is it?"
               "Virginia."
               "Two per cent. discount."
               "Yes; but you can have it for a couple of weeks, if it's any accommodation."
               "How much have you?"
               "Three hundred and fifty dollars."
               "Hold on to it, if you please, for an hour or two; and if I can't make up what I
                  want I will accept your offer."
               "Very well; it is at your service. I would do better for you, if I could; but I
                  just let Tompkins have all my current funds."
               Half a dozen more applications were made during the next hour; and all poor
                  Jenkins could raise was two hundred dollars, which must be returned on the next
                  day by twelve o'clock. This sum, with the three hundred and fifty dollars
                  uncurrent money, on which he would have to lose seven dollars in discount, left
                  him short four hundred and fifty dollars.
               It was near one o'clock, and he had already gone the entire rounds—so far as those
                  who had, on former occasions, taken the liberty to borrow of him were concerned.
                  As a money-hunter, he must now extend his walks farther. He must go to those who
                  had never come to him.
               There was, only a few doors from Mr. Jenkins, a retail dealer in the same line,
                  who had been one of his old employer's best customers. As a clerk, Jenkins had
                  frequently sold him goods, and waited upon him for the settlement of many bills.
                  Peters—that was the man's name—had always been very polite to Jenkins, both before
                  and since his entrance into business; and Jenkins, in consequence, liked Peters, and thought him very
                  much of a gentleman. In his extremity—one o'clock having arrived, and there being
                  yet four hundred and fifty dollars to make up—he determined to try Peters. At
                  first thought he shrunk from doing so; but necessity spurred him to the act.
               As Jenkins placed his foot within the store of Peters, his heart almost failed
                  him; but it was too late now to turn back, so he advanced. Peters was standing at
                  a desk in the back part of the store, busily engaged in making certain
                  calculations on a small slip of paper. Two or three parcels of bank notes were
                  lying before him, and near these were several bank notices. The fact was, Peters
                  was himself short; and whenever that was the case he, being of a nervous
                  temperament, was never very amiable. He had just discovered a little error in his
                  calculations, which showed him even worse off than he had believed, by several
                  hundred dollars, when a faltering voice near him pronounced his name. He turned
                  quickly, and, as his sharp eyes and knit brows were encountered by Jenkins, the
                  latter seemed almost to shrink into himself as he instinctively took off his
                  hat.
               "Mr. Jenkins," said Peters, not relaxing a muscle.
               "Mr. Peters, how are you?"
               "So so."
               Still the brows were unbent.
               "Any thing over to-day?" faltered Jenkins.
               "No!"
               That "No" must have been heard, to form a correct idea of the emphatic force with
                  which it was uttered. Poor Jenkins staggered back a pace or two, and then hastily
                  retired.
               "The tenth time I've had to say that in the last hour," muttered Peters, savagely,
                  as he turned to his desk.
               This last experience in borrowing from those who were "over," settled the matter
                  with Jenkins. It would have been about as easy to have forced him up to a cannon's
                  mouth as to have induced him to make another application of the kind.
               "I'd better fail and be done with it," said he to himself, as he went back with
                  hurried strides to his store; but the idea of failing became more and more
                  terrible to him the nearer the view he took.
               "I must prevent it, if I can." This, which was thought rather than uttered, marked
                  the reaction in his mind.
               "But how, how, how?" And he paced the floor backward and forward half a dozen
                  times.
               "Yes, yes, I'll do that. It's a straw, but I'll catch at it." And, so saying, he
                  started forth again. This time he went to the store of his old employers, and
                  asked an interview with the senior member of the firm, a kindhearted, liberal
                  man.
               "Mr. B—,"said Jenkins, as soon as they were alone, speaking frankly and without
                  embarrassment, "I've committed a great blunder."
               "In what?"
               "In going into business."
               "How so?"
               "I hadn't a dollar of capital."
               "I thought you had saved something."
               "No; I went into business on the sole basis of a credit."
               "That was a blunder."
               "So I have discovered; but, unfortunately, when it is too late to retrieve my
                  error."
               "You can't pay your notes, I presume."
               "Not out of my current business. I must borrow."
               "A poor dependence, Jenkins."
               "So I have found, this day, to my grief and disappointment. I have been trying for
                  nearly five hours to get a thousand dollars, but nobody has any thing to spare; so
                  I must let my paper lie over, and make a failure of it."
               "That won't do, Jenkins," said Mr. B—.
               "I'd rather fail twenty times than keep up a half dead and alive business
                  existence by 'shinning it.' No, no; that won't suit me, no how. One day's
                  experience is enough. How people stand it who run about daily from nine o'clock
                  until half-past two, to get money to meet their notes, is more than I can tell. It
                  would kill me in a month. I'd rather fail at once, and be done with it. Failure
                  must come at last."
               
               "Well, what do you want to say to me on the subject?" asked B—.
               "Simply," replied Jenkins, "to call my store yours, and me your clerk, for a few
                  months, until the business can be settled up—you, in the mean time, paying the
                  notes that fall due, in order to keep all concerned free from the loss that
                  inevitably follows a failure in business. There's enough to make you perfectly
                  safe."
               "You are certain of that?"
               "Oh yes; I've made very fair profits, and lived frugally. You can furnish goods
                  from your own store to keep up the stock while I'm selling off what is now on
                  hand. In this way you will be able to more than pay the expenses of the store, and
                  bring all out safely in the end."
               "I must have a little time to think about this, Jenkins," said B—. "I wish you had
                  mentioned the subject a week or two ago, so that I could have looked into the
                  affair before your extremity came. You want a thousand dollars to-day?"
               "Yes."
               B— sat and thought for some three or four minutes. "You must have it, I suppose,"
                  said he, at length. "I don't like these failures in business. Their reaction upon
                  trade is bad. I'll give you a check for a thousand dollars to-day. Pay your notes,
                  and then go to work and get up a statement of your exact condition. If it all
                  looks right, perhaps—but no matter what. Do as I wish, and let me see you
                  to-morrow."
               A heavy weight was suddenly rolled from the feelings of Jenkins. He felt as light
                  as a feather as he went back to his store, holding tightly in his hand a check for
                  one thousand dollars.
               On the next day, after a long interview with Mr. B—, who had always felt a
                  friendly interest in Jenkins, it was decided to continue the business, B— to be a
                  silent partner, and furnish a certain amount of capital. That settled the fortunes
                  of the young man. He is still in business, and doing well. While Tompkins and
                  dozens of others like him are on the street, daily, from nine till half-past two,
                  as eager money-hunters, you will find him at his counter, attending to customers,
                  or at the auctions, ready to secure any good bargains that may happen to offer.
                  And you will, moreover, find him a prosperous merchant, when Tompkins, and eight
                  out of ten of such able "financiers," are driven under, and the ripples on the
                  surface of trade that marked the place of their disaster are no longer to be
                  seen.
               To start in business with only credit for a capital, is to lean
                  upon a broken reed. Thousands have learned this to their sorrow.
            
            
               
               THROWING DUST IN PEOPLE'S EYES.
               THERE are many ways in which this is done—we mean throwing dust in people's eyes.
                  In all the varied walks of life, from the leaders of political parties down to the
                  scavengers who clean the streets, a certain set of individuals find especial
                  delight in the work. In most cases, it is the hand of self-interest that throws
                  the dust, and persons are blinded in order that they may not see the false moves
                  about to be made against them.
               It generally happens that your dust-throwing fraternity are, in the end, pretty
                  well understood; and those who have once been blinded, manage to keep at least one
                  eye clear, and fixed intently upon them. In a word, throwing dust may do very well
                  for a time, but, like all evil work, it has its day and its hour. In the end, more
                  is lost than gained.
               "Aping their betters," but without the motive of self-interest, and in the mere
                  wantonness of ill-nature, your street-scavengers manage to do a pretty large share
                  in the work of throwing dust in people's eyes, and their mode of doing it is of
                  the most literal character. If the day happens to be windy, and you see one of
                  this industrious fraternity approaching a box, barrel, or basket of dry
                  coal-ashes, take our advice and cross the street, for the moment eschewing all
                  dainty regard for flag-stones. In all cases of this kind, we are clear in the
                  opinion that discretion is the better part of valour, and practise on the rule
                  invariably. Even a soiled boot is to be preferred to dust in the eyes.
               Patrick Mooney—he was, probably, third cousin to
                     Throwing dust in people's eyes.
                  
                   Peter Mulrooney, who did, or, rather,
                  who did not sell Mr. Urban's strawberry cow; though Patrick was an ill-natured
                  boy, compared with Peter—Patrick Mooney had been six months in "Amereky," and in
                  that short space of time had made the discovery that we are all lords here, and
                  that he was as good as anybody, and a little better, too, if the truth were known.
                  So Patrick, in his independence, not only stuck out his elbows so far that they
                  sadly annoyed other people's ribs, but even ventured, occasionally, to give said
                  elbows a sort of an outward flying motion, by which the ribs aforesaid were rather
                  severely bruised. Of course, Patrick had to take the consequences; but he did not
                  seem to grow much wiser for all that. One or two good places were lost because the
                  independent citizen asserted, as was thought, rather too broadly his independence,
                  and he finally came down to the necessity of accepting the office of City
                  Collector—of ashes.
               Patrick was rather humiliated by this fall of a man who was "as good as anybody;"
                  but he soon saw that he had it in his power to be revenged on society for the
                  wrong he sustained at its hands; and revenge in just the way that suited his
                  direct aims and purposes. He could throw dust in people's eyes to his heart's
                  content, and well did he do his work.
               But emptying ash-pans and ash-barrels did not yield a very handsome income for the
                  somewhat ambitious Mooney, and he kept on the look-out for some more desirable
                  occupation.
               "Pathrick," said Mrs. Mooney, one evening, to her husband, on his return home from
                  his day's work—"Ise got news for yees. Andy Muckleroy's dead."
               "Andy Muckleroy, is it, indade! Faix! and it's an ill wind that blows nobody good.
                  He's lost a grand place."
               "And ye must thry and get it, Pathrick."
               "Dad! and I'm just the boy to try. I'll be made up if I can get the
                  siteation."
               "Ye doesn't know Musther Blakely?"
               "No; but I've got friends. Dad! but I'll go about it bright and early the morrow
                  mornin."
               
               So, early on the next day, Patrick ran around among a few friends, and got them to
                  sign a recommendation, preparatory to his application for the place made vacant by
                  the death of Mr. Blakely's porter. With this he called at the merchant's store
                  about nine o'clock, but was not so fortunate as to find him in. He stated his
                  object, however, to the principal clerk, who gave his some encouragement.
               "Leave your paper with me," said that individual, "and call again about three
                  o'clock. You will be certain to find Mr. Blakely here at that time."
               So Patrick Mooney retired, and went about his work of collecting ashes. He was
                  unusually elated at the prospect of a speedy elevation above his present grade in
                  society, which, it must be owned, had never been very flattering to his vanity;
                  and this state of mental excitement caused him to throw his ashes about with an
                  emphasis that kept the vicinity in which he happened to be in a perfect cloud of
                  dust. Wo to the pedestrian, male or female, who happened to be to the leeward of
                  Patrick, when he discharged the contents of an ash-pan into his cart; and, it
                  cannot be denied, that he managed to make the contents of each box or pan do, to
                  its full extent, the annoying duty he desired it to perform. Of course, Patrick
                  did not seem to be aware of the blinded eyes and bedusted garments
                  that followed in his wake, but he was keenly alive to the whole performance, and
                  enjoyed it amazingly.
               While thus employed, Mooney observed a well-dressed man approaching, and resolved
                  to give his glossy black coat and shining hat a fine powdering. So he poised a tub
                  of ashes in his hands and waited until he had him just in the wind, then
                  dexterously throwing the contents into the air, he had the satisfaction of seeing
                  a large portion blown directly into the face and over the person of the
                  handsomely-dressed pedestrian. The man stopped, and after rubbing his eyes clear,
                  looked steadily at the Irishman, who could not keep back the chuckle that was in
                  his heart. Angry words were on his lips; but he restrained them and passed on.
               Punctually at three o'clock, Mooney was at the store of Mr. Blakely.
               "Is the jontilman in?" he asked of the clerk he had seen in the morning.
               "You will find him back in his office," was answered.
               "Has he seen my racamindation?" inquired Mooney.
               "He has."
               "He hasn't ony one engaged yet?"
               "No."
               "Do ye think he will take me?"
               "We want a man immediately, and I think your chance is good. But, step back and
                  see Mr. Blakely yourself."
               With hat in hand, and a face all meekness, Patrick Mooney presented himself to the
                  merchant. But what was his surprise to find himself in the presence of the man in
                  whose face and over whose person he had but a few hours before scattered ashes in
                  the most wanton and outrageous manner. The recognition was mutual.
               "Well, sir?" Mr. Blakely spoke in a quick, indignant voice.
               "Me name is Pathrick Mooney, y'r honour," stammered the Irishman in much
                  confusion. "Yee's wants a—a—porther, sir, in the place of Andy Muckleroy. I left
                  my racamindation the morning."
               "I don't want you, sir," returned the merchant, controlling himself, and partly
                  turning from the applicant as he spoke. "A man that don't know his place as a
                  scavenger, will not be likely to know it as a porter."
               The Irishman retired something wiser than when he came in. It was, to him, the
                  turning of a new leaf in the book of human life. He is still a scavenger, but has
                  had quite enough of throwing dust in people's eyes, and rarely indulges in the
                  sport.
            
            
               
               THE PUNCTUAL MAN.
               MR. JENKINS was a punctual man—a very punctual man. He was not only up to time in
                  every thing, but usually a little in advance of time. Of such a thing as being too
                  late for an engagement, no one ever knew him to be guilty. On the other hand, Mrs.
                  Jenkins had very little regard to the passage of time. Ask Mr. Jenkins what
                  o'clock it was at any period of the day, and his answer, promptly given, and
                  without consulting his gold lever, would rarely vary ten minutes from the real
                  time. Ask Mrs. Jenkins the same question, and if she came within two hours of it,
                  the fact would be remarkable.
               "Now, my dear, do hurry! We shall be too late."
               Never did Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins go upon a journey, or attend church or party,
                  without a dozen repetitions of this admonition, mildly urged in the beginning,
                  but, in a nervous, impatient tone of voice, ere the lingering spouse deemed her
                  person all in trim for the contemplated movement. In most cases, even with all the
                  punctual husband's efforts to bring his wife up to time, but little advance was
                  ever gained. Service had usually commenced ere they reached the church on Sunday,
                  notwithstanding Mr. Jenkins's nervous horror of disturbing by an untimely entrance
                  a worshipping assembly, and notwithstanding his weekly repetition of—
               "Now do, my dear, try and be ready in time to-day." They were usually among the
                  last at a tea-party; and upon them rested the guilt of disturbing the temper,
                  wearing out the patience, and spoiling the oysters of the fair hostess. More than
                  once had the prophecy—
                     The Punctual Man.
                  
                   "We'll be too late for the steamboat,"
                  met a literal fulfilment.
               One would naturally think that frequent experiences of this kind must work a
                  change. Far from it. It was just as natural for Mrs. Jenkins to take no note of
                  time, as for her husband to be noting it all the while.
               Last summer they decided on a trip to Boston, and after all needful preparation
                  the day arrived that was to witness their departure.
               "Come, dear!" said Mr. Jenkins, just as day began to dawn. "It's time to get up.
                  We shall be late."
               "Late! It's only a little past four o'clock, and the boat doesn't leave until
                  nine."
               And Mrs. Jenkins, who had been aroused from a pleasant slumber, composed herself
                  for another nap.
               "Come! come! We shall be late."
               Mr. Jenkins spoke now in a more earnest voice, for the first rays of the uprisen
                  sun were streaming in at the chamber window.
               "Plenty of time," returned Mrs. Jenkins, showing no very strong inclination to
                  rise.
               Mr. Jenkins, who was up and partly dressed, now bethought himself of consulting
                  his watch, when to his surprise he found that it was full an hour later than he
                  had supposed it to be.
               "Come! come!" said he, impatiently. "It is nearly half-past six o'clock."
               "Oh no," returned his wife.
               "It is then, and no mistake. See for yourself!" and he held the gold lever before
                  her eyes.
               "I declare! I had no idea that it was so late."
               Mrs. Jenkins sprung from the bed and commenced dressing herself hurriedly. Twice
                  the bell rang for breakfast before she was ready to obey the summons. But at
                  length she took her way to the dining-room, and, much to her husband's relief, she
                  left the table in full time to finish all needful preparations for the
                  journey.
               The breakfast scene, which finally ended so much to Mr. Jenkins's satisfaction, is
                  worthy of a passing note.
               Mr. Jenkins received his cup of coffee from the hand of his wife with a nervous
                  jerk, and in bringing it down upon the
                  table beside him, managed to spill a third of it upon the white cloth. Then, in
                  putting his cup too eagerly to his lips, he scalded his mouth.
               "Here! give me some cream. This coffee is as hot as fire!" he exclaimed, as he
                  handed back his cup.
               More cream was supplied, and then the cup of coffee was emptied at a single
                  draught.
               The work of breaking an egg and pouring out its contents came next in order.
                  Usually, Mr. Jenkins could perform this delicate operation with considerable
                  skill. On the present occasion he spilled a portion over the side of his egg-cup,
                  soiled his fingers, and made "such a time of it," that he pushed egg and cup from
                  him with an impatient—
               "What a mess I'm making of it!"
               Mr. Jenkins next attacked the toast, and bolted a couple of slices in a twinkling.
                  Having done which, he drew forth his watch, to consult it, and see how the time
                  was passing.
               "We must hurry," said he, involuntarily. "Time goes quickly."
               "Well, I declare," returned Mrs. Jenkins, "you're the most nervous, impatient man,
                  I ever saw! Now do eat your breakfast. There is plenty of time."
               But Mr. Jenkins arose and walked the floor of the dining-room until his wife had
                  concluded her morning meal.
               At half-past eight the carriage was to be at the door. The trunks were strapped,
                  and Mr. Jenkins ready for the removal some time before that period; and to Mrs.
                  Jenkins's credit be it spoken, she was ready to the minute.
               "That man ought to be here," said Mr. Jenkins, as the hand of his gold lever
                  approached the figure four. "I don't like this putting off things until the last
                  moment."
               And he went to the door and stood for some time looking down the street. But no
                  carriage appeared in sight. Then he returned into the house, and walked the
                  parlour floor for a minute and a half, at the end of which time he drew forth his
                  watch for another consultation. Five minutes more, and it would be half-past eight
                  o'clock.
               "If he should disappoint me!" said Mr. Jenkins, nervously.
               "Oh, he'll be here," returned Mrs. Jenkins, with much composure. Don't be
                  uneasy."
               "But I am uneasy. I'm almost certain the man will disappoint us. I wish I'd taken
                  his number."
               "What good would that have done?" asked Mrs. Jenkins, calmly.
               "I'd have him before the Mayor."
               Mr. Jenkins went to the door again, and gazed anxiously down the street. No
                  carriage was in sight.
               "Half-past eight!" he ejaculated, coming into the parlour where Mrs. Jenkins sat
                  all ready for departure. "What is to be done?"
               "Don't feel uneasy. I am certain he will be here," said Mrs. Jenkins. "He can
                  drive down easily in a quarter of an hour. So there is plenty of time to
                  spare."
               "No, there isn't plenty of time to spare. Besides, I told him to be here by
                  half-past eight, and not a minute later."
               Five, ten, fifteen minutes went stealing by, and yet no carriage appeared. The
                  reader may imagine the state of mind into which Mr. Jenkins was thrown.
               But a quarter of an hour remained ere the steamboat would leave the wharf.
                  Fortunately for Mr. Jenkins, a porter came by just at this juncture, with his
                  empty wheel-barrow.
               "Here, good fellow!" cried Jenkins; "are you engaged?"
               "No, sir," was answered.
               "Then come in quickly and get my trunks. The carriage has disappointed me, and I
                  must be at the New York boat by nine o'clock."
               The porter obeyed with alacrity. In a few minutes he was on his way, with the
                  trunks, toward Walnut street wharf, and Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins, the former with
                  carpet-bag in hand, hurrying after him. But the steps of Mrs. Jenkins were far too
                  deliberate for those of her excited husband.
               "Indeed, you must move quicker, or we will be too late," he said, at every half
                  square.
               Great was the speed at which they swept along the street.
               
               "Just four minutes left," said Mr. Jenkins, as they passed the exchange.
               At length they reached the foot of Walnut street.
               "Has the boat gone yet?" breathlessly inquired Jenkins of a coloured porter.
               "Oh no," was replied, with a broad smile on Ethiop's face.
               At this moment the eyes of Mr. Jenkins rested upon the upper works of the
                  steamboat, which were in motion.
               "She's off!" he ejaculated. "Quick! quick!" And he sprang several paces in advance
                  of his wife, running down the avenue to the dock from which the boat had
                  moved.
               "Stop! Stop a moment!" he cried to the captain, who was on the upper deck. "Stop!
                  Hold up! Just a moment!"
               But the boat was loosened from her fastenings, and quietly moved down the stream.
                  On her way she kept, as steadily as if no Mr. Jenkins stood calling out and
                  gesticulating on the shore.
               "Too bad! too bad! I'll have that fellow fined for disappointing me."
               "It is too bad," said Mrs. Jenkins, panting from over exertion, "to be
                  disappointed after all this!"
               "The boat's coming back again," said a man who stood near.
               "Coming back again!"
               "Oh yes. She's merely heading round. It isn't time for her to start by an
                  hour."
               "But it's nine o'clock," said Mr. Jenkins, drawing out his watch.
               "Oh no, sir; only eight."
               "Eight!"
               Mr. Jenkins stood with a bewildered air for a moment. Then light broke in upon his
                  mind.
               "Only eight!" he repeated. "Right! Sure enough! Well, that is a good one!"
               "Only eight!" said Mrs. Jenkins. "That's strange! Does your watch say nine?"
               "Yes. But now I remember, it is just an hour too fast."
               "Why, Mr. Jenkins! How comes this?"
               But Mr. Jenkins, who was caught in his own trap, did not venture to explain that
                  he had, on the night before, set his watch an hour ahead, in order to cheat his
                  wife into being ready in time for the boat! Yet, this was really so. Mrs. Jenkins,
                  however, who was a pretty shrewd woman, guessed at the real truth as they sat, a
                  few minutes afterward, in the cabin of the John Stevens, the only passengers for
                  New York who had yet made their appearance, and she charged the fact upon him so
                  directly that equivocation was of no avail. He has not heard the last of the
                  affair yet.
               For all this and other little experiences on the part of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins, no
                  particular change has taken place on either side. Mr. Jenkins remains the same
                  nervously-punctual man, and Mrs. Jenkins the same even-tempered,
                  immovably-unpunctual woman. And so it is likely to be with them to the end. So
                  little do men and women profit by the experiences of life when they react upon
                  constitutional weaknesses, defects, and peculiarities of character, confirmed by
                  long habit.
            
            
               
               
                  
               
               SHORT OF FUEL.
               IT was the first week in March—a raw, blustering day.
               The month had come in like a lion, giving the pleasing hope that it would go out
                  like a lamb. I had finished my breakfast, and, having donned my overcoat, was
                  drawing on my gloves, when my wife called to me from the dining-room, where she
                  still sat at the table, in an earnest voice—
               "Oh, I declare, I forgot to tell you that the coal was all gone. We must have more
                  to-day."
               "Coal gone!" I exclaimed. "Impossible!"
               "Yes. Biddy says there isn't enough to last until night."
               "She must be mistaken," said I in a positive voice. "I laid in twenty tons in
                  October."
               "'Deed, an' there isn't the full of a coal-scuttle in the cellar," spoke out
                  Biddy, who was in the dining-room. "I put the last in the furnace this
                  morning."
               "The furnace coal gone also?"
               "Yis, indeed," replied Biddy, who, the huzzy! it was evident from her tone of
                  voice, enjoyed my astonishment and discomfiture; "I've been using the range coal
                  in the furnace these two weeks."
               "Well, that beats all," said I, drawing off my gloves and approaching the
                  dining-room door; "twenty tons of coal in five months! four tons a month! What
                  have you done with it, Biddy? You never could have burned it all, if you had
                  tried."
               "I didn't ate it nor stale it!" replied Biddy, in a huff.
               "But what has been done with it? I can't make that out. Four tons of coal a month,
                  and only three fires. There must be some mistake. It can't possibly be all
                  gone."
               "Yees can go and see for yerself," said Biddy, in her independent way.
               I shook my head and looked as grave as an alderman with a case before him. A dozen
                  times through the winter I had found occasion to remonstrate with Biddy touching
                  her manner of using coal. Both the range and furnace had been newly put up in the
                  fall, and careful directions left for their proper use.
               "You see, Biddy," said I to her, after the range was set and a fire made in it by
                  one of the workmen, "you must never let the coal come above this fire-brick. If
                  you do, it will neither burn so freely nor give such a good heat."
               "Oh yis, sir; I understands all about it. I'm used to ranges," replied Biddy,
                  unhesitatingly.
               "Moreover," I continued, as though I had not heard her, "if you build the fire up
                  to the top plate, you will crack that and the front piece with the intense
                  heat."
               
               "And do yees think I would destroy your things in that way?" said the girl, half
                  indignantly.
               "No, not wilfully, Biddy," I soothingly answered, "but ignorantly."
               "Troth, and I'm not such an ignoramus as yees take me for. As if I'd never seed a
                  range in all my born days! D'ye think there are no ranges in the ould
                  counthry?"
               "No doubt they're as plenty there as blackberries, Biddy," said I, beginning to be
                  a little out of patience; "but that doesn't signify here nor there. I want you to
                  regulate this one according to instructions—to follow your orders, if you break
                  your owner."
               "Troth and I can soon break it for yees, if that's what ye want."
               "I haven't the least doubt of that, Biddy," I retorted; "for you're good at that
                  work. But I'm particular in wanting this range preserved from all such
                  catastrophies. I wish it taken good care of; so, all you have to do is to follow
                  my directions in using it; and, if any damage is done, I will be responsible."
               "If yees wants to be cook," said Biddy, tartly, "I'll act as scullion."
               Finding that I was getting into a humour that threatened to lead me into words and
                  acts not over dignified for the head of a family, I retired from the kitchen
                  without another word. I had invaded my wife's province, and the sharp-witted Irish
                  girl only let me see the instant failure of respect that took place in her
                  mind.
               On the morning after this interview, I took occasion to look into the kitchen on
                  some pretence. It was as I had expected. The fire-chamber of the range was so full
                  of coal that portions of the ignited fuel projected in the shape of a cone through
                  the hole in the top plate, which was red with heat. I was about entering a
                  strongly uttered protest against such a proceeding, when a remembrance of the
                  girl's intractable temper, as displayed on the day before, warned me to
                  desist.
               "Biddy will destroy that range in a month," said I to my wife, as I went back to
                  the room where she was sitting.
               "In what way?" was asked.
               "She keeps the fire-chamber full of coals to the top plate, when I expressly told
                  her that it must not be made above the fire-brick. By doing so, she not only
                  checks the draft, but injures the range, and destroys a third more fuel."
               "I told her of that yesterday. But she says the oven won't bake unless the chamber
                  is full of coal."
               "It's not true. A free fire will give more heat than a smothered one, as anybody
                  of common sense may know. I wish you would insist upon her managing it right."
               "I'll do all in my power; but I can't be always in the kitchen," replied my wife,
                  a little coldly.
               I said no more; for I felt that, though master in my own house, there was a limit
                  to my authority. But I could not always tamely submit to the destruction and
                  disorder that ranged in the lower departments of the household. Occasionally, I
                  would suggest to Biddy that she was not managing the range as I had directed;
                  while at other times I would jog her memory more roughly. All, however, availed
                  not. The coal was still piled to the top plate, that, in a few weeks, was cracked
                  in two pieces from the intense heat to which it was constantly subjected.
               As for the furnace, or heater, of which Biddy also had the care, it was managed
                  about as well as the range. Whenever I had occasion to go into the cellar, I found
                  the coal in the fire-cylinder piled far above the brick lining and almost rolling
                  from the feeder, while the sheet-iron above the fire-brick was red for the space
                  of several inches. Of course this consumed more coal, injured the furnace,
                  vitiated the air, and diminished the amount of heat usually obtained from a given
                  amount of fuel.
               Two or three times I took Biddy into the cellar and explained all this to her. But
                  I might as well have talked to the wind. She generally resented the interference
                  on my part as a trespass upon her particular province, and a charge of ignorance;
                  neither of which she could or would tolerate for a moment.
               Thus it had been during the winter. I therefore knew Biddy's character pretty
                  well, and quickly came to the conclusion that from her no satisfaction, touching
                  the departed twenty tons of coal, was to be obtained. As to her invitation to dive down into the cellar and see
                  for myself, I felt in no humour to accept of it.
               "Don't neglect," said my wife, as I still stood in the dining-room door, "to send
                  us some coal immediately. Biddy says there isn't enough to last until
                  dinner-time."
               "Indade and there a'n't," spoke up Biddy, in a kind of triumphant voice; "I
                  scraped up the last this very mornin'. There's not the full of a coal-scuttle in
                  the whole cellar."
               "You're sure of that," said I.
               "'Dade, and I am jist. Sure, yees can go and see for yerself."
               As talking would not put a ton of coal in the cellar, I broke short the interview,
                  and, turning away, left the house.
               "Twenty tons of coal in five months," said I to myself, musing, as I walked along.
                  "It's incredible! How she could have burnt up that quantity, even with the end of
                  waste in her mind, passes my comprehension. These Irish girls do beat the Old
                  Harry himself in destruction. Half starved, and half frozen over their turf-fires
                  at home, they come over here, and finding things in plenty around them, go to work
                  with the purpose, it seems, of ascertaining how much they can waste and destroy;
                  and, goodness knows! they are successful experimenters, as every housekeeper feels
                  to his sorrow."
               But grumbling was of no avail. More coal must be purchased. So, on my way down
                  town, I called at a coal-office and ordered three more tons to be sent home.
               "Be particular in sending it this morning," said I. "We are entirely out of
                  fuel."
               The dealer promised that it should be done, and I went on my way. At two o'clock I
                  returned home to dinner. It was one of those raw, cold, wet, shivering days
                  peculiar to March; and by the time I had reached my house, I was about as
                  uncomfortable as I could wish to be. The melted snow on the pavement had
                  penetrated my boots, completely saturating my stockings. I was conscious, from my
                  sensations, that I was taking cold, and felt anxious to get into a warm room, and
                  change my stockings, drawers, and pantaloons for others that were dry.
               As I opened my door, I was not affected, as usual, with the warmth of a genial
                  atmosphere. I walked into the parlours, and putting my hand against the register,
                  discovered that not a particle of heat was entering the room. I perceived that the
                  dining-room door was closed, so I returned to the passage. Ascending to the first
                  landing, from which this door opened, I entered the room, and found my wife, with
                  a shawl drawn around her shoulders, hovering with the children around the
                  radiator-stove, in which was faintly visible, through the transparent mica in the
                  door, the remains of a departing fire.
               "Hasn't that coal been sent home?" I asked, in surprise at the omission.
               "No coal has come to-day," replied my wife, shivering; "and we are almost
                  perished. The fire has gone out in the furnace and range, and is going out here.
                  Not a mouthful of dinner has been cooked."
               "Dear! dear! dear! That's too bad! too bad! I ordered coal the first thing as I
                  went down; and told the dealer particularly to send it home this morning, as we
                  were entirely out."
               "He hasn't done it then. What shall we do? I've taken cold already, and the
                  children will get their deaths."
               "Surely, enough coal might have been scraped up to keep the fire alive," said
                  I.
               "I sent Biddy down twice, and told her to rake and scrape up every piece she could
                  find; but she could only get the scuttle a third full."
               "I'll be bound I can find coal there," said I, positively, and away I turned and
                  plunged down into the cellar. It was so dark that, for a few moments, I could see
                  nothing. But I groped my way to a window, and removed a blind made for the purpose
                  of excluding cold in winter. Then I went back to the coal-bins. In one, I found a
                  large pile of dust, several feet in thickness. On probing this with a stick, I
                  discovered that it contained an abundance of coal, in large and small lumps, which
                  it only needed a little trouble to extricate. There was not less than half a ton
                  concealed in this pile of dust and refuse. Another bin was examined, and about a
                  quarter of a ton discovered there. As much more was concealed in the third bin. Then, scattered about in all
                  directions, under the wood, covered with chips, and lurking in corners, where it
                  had been carelessly left, was full half a ton more of good coal; making, in all,
                  about a ton and a half; and yet the house was as cold as winter, and no dinner had
                  been cooked for want of fuel.
               "Well, this does beat all!" said I to myself, as I glanced around in wonder.
               "Do you find any there?" called my wife to me, in an incredulous voice, from the
                  top of the stairs.
               "Any! Yes; a couple of tons or so," was my reply.
               "Indade, thin," cried Biddy, who was at the side of my wife, "and there isn't the
                  full of a hod there that I could see."
               "None so blind as them that won't see," I retorted, angrily. "Bring me down some
                  matches and a newspaper, and I'll soon have a fire in the furnace."
               I was now pretty well up, so far as temper was concerned, and when that is the
                  case, I generally make all stand around me, as they say. In a few minutes Biddy
                  came down with the matches, her countenance somewhat fallen in its aspect. I was
                  at work clearing out the ashes and cinders from the furnace. That done, I took the
                  newspaper from her hand, and thrust it down into the cylinder. On this I poured
                  about a peck of charcoal, and, closing the door, touched a match to the paper
                  below. In a moment or two all was in a blaze, and the igniting charcoal crackling
                  as it absorbed the heat. Next I took a shovel, and in a few hurried applications
                  of it to certain half-hidden receptacles of coal that I had discovered, scraped
                  together enough to last for a couple of days.
               "Do you see that?" said I, speaking with no great show of amiability.
               "Sure, and it's very strange!" meekly replied Biddy.
               "Indeed it is; passing strange!" I retorted. "With nearly two tons of coal in the
                  cellar, and not a fire in the house. There's half a ton in that bin, mixed up with
                  coal-dust. See there!" and I dashed my shovel into the centre of the bin, and
                  raking open the heap of dust, showed a solid bed of large-sized coal at the
                  bottom; adding, as I did so: "And now please to take a scuttleful up into the
                  dining-room, with some charcoal, and set that fire going in the quickest possible
                  time."
               Biddy did not linger, you may be sure, in obeying this direction. She had seen me
                  worked up before, and was pretty well aware of the fact, that it would not take
                  much more provocation to make me turn her out of the house, bag and baggage.
               By this time, the charcoal I had thrown into the furnace was thoroughly ignited.
                  In order to get up the heat that was needed, as quickly as possible, I turned in
                  about half a bushel more of charcoal on top of this, and then filled it up with
                  the hard coal. As I closed the door of the feeder, the draught roared
                  encouragingly, and gave promise of a speedy change in the chilling aspect of
                  affairs above. On ascending and placing my hand over the register, the inward
                  pressure of warm air was already perceived; and long before the dining-room fire
                  had begun to burn freely, my shivering wife and children were gathered in the
                  parlour, and beginning to rejoice over the presence of a more agreeable
                  atmosphere.
               Of course, we had no regular dinner. It was too late in the day for the
                  preparation of that meal. But, by the time the dining-room was warm enough for
                  occupation, the kettle had been boiled, and a cup of tea, with some bread and
                  butter, solaced us for the loss of a more substantial repast.
               Through some mistake my order for coal was not attended to, and consequently we
                  had no new supply. I waited patiently and curiously for the result. Steadily, as
                  of old, there was a rush of hot air into the parlours, and when I glanced into the
                  kitchen, I saw the range piled to the top plate as before; while there was no lack
                  of heat in the dining-room. I did not renew the order for coal, for I wanted to
                  see how long this state of things would last.
               One morning, about three weeks from the time when Biddy could not "find the full
                  of a scuttle" of coal in the cellar, that young lady, who had been particularly
                  active and obliging since the occurrence described, whispered something in the ear
                  of my wife as we sat at the break-fast-table. On her leaving the room, my wife
                  said—
               
               "Biddy wishes me to tell you that she has scraped up all the coal in the cellar it
                  is possible to find, and that there is not more than enough to last through the
                  day and make up the fires in the morning."
               "Oh, very well. I will see that there is a new supply." And I laughed outright as
                  I spoke.
               I did not go into the cellar to make any further examinations, for I was well
                  convinced that we were now "short of fuel," and no mistake; but as it was near to
                  the first of April, and the day was mild as spring, I did not suffer very severely
                  in view of the extra expense for coal required to enable us to pass through the
                  season. The order for a fresh supply, that I gave as I passed to my business, was
                  more promptly filled than the one previously given.
            
            
               
                  
               
               THE FIRST CIGAR.
               THROUGH many temptation, Harry Lawson had kept himself pure from the vice of
                  smoking until he arrived at the age of manhood. To him it was a most disgusting and filthy practice; and there were
                  certain of his acquaintances whose persons were so offensive, from the fact that
                  they ever bore about them a sickening odour of tobacco smoke, that he disliked to
                  come near them. How delicate ladies could endure the presence of men whose clothes
                  were ever reeking with fumes from the nauseous weed, was to him a subject of
                  especial wonder. Young men are very apt to fall into the habit, on first entering
                  life, of speaking lightly of the other sex; they generally learn better ere many
                  years pass over their heads. Harry fell into this habit about the time he attained
                  his majority; but his light remarks were never meant for more than a playful
                  retaliation upon his sister Helen, whose wit was rather sharp when men came within
                  reach of a good thrust.
               "If any animal but man," he used sometimes to say, "with an odour half as
                  offensive as that which a smoker bears about him in his clothes and hair, were to
                  come into a lady's presence, she would faint on the instant. But 'the man's the
                  man for a' that!"'
               Helen was usually highly indignant at such insinuations, and would declare that,
                  for her part, she could much better endure the presence of a whole menagerie than
                  one tobacco-smoker.
               "Ugh! To have a man breathe his rank breath into your face until you grow faint
                  under the infliction! To have the atmosphere of the room in which you are sitting
                  so tainted by the filthy clothes of a smoker—young, accomplished, well-dressed,
                  and good-looking though he be—as to be obliged, as I have been, to air it for
                  hours before the offensive smell could be obliterated! To have your handkerchief
                  filled with the sickly odour, and your lips coated with a disgusting, bitter
                  film"—
               "Lips, Helen! Lips!" exclaimed the brother, when this remark was made. "Why, is it
                  possible that you let young men, and smokers at that, kiss you!"
               "Now, Harry, that is too bad! Kiss me!" and a shiver ran through the young girl's
                  frame. "I might endure to be kissed by a dog or a monkey, but by a tobacco-chewer
                  or smoker—never! Ugh! The very thought makes me shudder."
               "Then how could your lips be so strangely contaminated?"
               "Easily enough, as you very well know; for I have heard you, dozens of times,
                  complain of the very same thing, and seen you over and over again, wash your lips
                  with cologne, after having endured the presence of a smoker, in order to free them
                  from the bitter, sickening deposit they had received from the air he had filled
                  with a nauseous vapour."
               "It is horrible; there's no denying that," was the usual admission of Harry, in
                  closing a light sparring contest of this nature. "How a 'human' who makes any
                  pretensions to decency, can render himself so disgusting, passes my
                  comprehension."
               Harry Lawson was a young attorney but recently admitted to the bar. He occupied,
                  as an office, the front parlour of the house in which his family resided, and
                  there, patiently or impatiently, according as his temper of mind happened to be,
                  awaited the appearance of some members of that class of individuals who know their
                  rights and are willing to contend for them. Daily he sat and read for hours, or
                  wandered into the court-room to note the cases on trial and mark the peculiar
                  modes of attack and defence as carried on by legal belligerents. Idle time on his
                  hands led him to seek company and modes of overcoming the dullness of waiting for
                  something to do. Riding out, tavern-lounging, meeting with young attorneys in
                  their offices, and such other ways of killing time as happened to turn up, were
                  all resorted to by the incipient lawyer. Of course—
               "Have a cigar, Harry?" was asked of him daily; for, among his associates, nine of
                  ten used the weed.
               "Don't smoke! Is it possible?' in nearly all cases met his refusal of the cigar,
                  even by those whose offer of a regalia he had declined some forty times before.
                  And then would follow looks or nods that made him feel that he lacked a manly (?)
                  accomplishment. Often he was the odd one in a party of three or four, all of whom,
                  but himself, were sending up their gracefully wreathing columns of smoke, which
                  fairly darkened the room in which they sat, and almost suffocated him. So far,
                  when this was the case, from partaking
                  of or adding to the general enjoyment, he rather took from the pleasure of his
                  companions and felt uncomfortable himself.
               One day Harry was offered a cigar by a friend, in whose office he was sitting.
               "No, I thank you," came as usual from his lips. "I never use them."
               "No? Why, man, you don't know what you lose. There is nothing that I enjoy like a
                  good cigar."
               "Smoking seems to me an idle, useless habit," said Lawson, in reply to this.
               "That only shows what you know about it. There is nothing equal, as a digester, to
                  a good cigar. I don't think I could live without a cigar after dinner. And then,
                  when you sit down alone, or with a friend in the evening, after the excitement and
                  care of the day are over, it tranquilizes your feelings and gives wings to your
                  thoughts. You don't know what you lose, Harry. Take my advice and learn to smoke.
                  Here," and he tossed a cigar into the hat of Lawson, "is one of the mildest and
                  purest flavoured cigars I ever had. Try it."
               Harry shook his head, and lifting the cigar, reached it to his companion; but the
                  latter pushed back the hand, saying—
               "No—no. I want you to try that. If not now, take it home with you. It's as mild
                  and sweet-flavoured as a rose."
               When Harry got home, the cigar was still in his hat; and, as he removed the latter
                  from his head, it fell upon the floor. He picked it up and looked at it. Next he
                  inhaled its fragrance.
               "It smells pleasant enough," said he. There was a glowing grate before him, and
                  lamp-lighters on the mantel. To set fire to the little roll of tobacco was the
                  easiest thing in the world. Something whispered him to make the experiment, and,
                  in a moment of weakness, he yielded to the temptation. Next the cigar touched his
                  lips; and then he drew his mouth full of offensive smoke. After puffing this out,
                  he tried it again; and repeated the operation for half a dozen times in quick
                  succession. Then there was a brief pause for reflection and observation of the
                  sensations produced. The latter were not remarkably pleasant. With a sort of blind
                  desperation he put the cigar again to his mouth, and drew away upon it for two or
                  three times more. As he removed it from his lips, he experienced rather a
                  disagreeable feeling about the epiglottis; water, at the same time, beginning to
                  pour rather freely from the glands into his mouth. Not liking this sensation, he
                  arose and commenced walking about the floor; but it increased instead of
                  diminishing. In a little while he sat down upon a sofa that was in the room,
                  feeling decidedly sick. Just at this moment, Helen entered the office and on
                  seeing her brother looking very pale, exclaimed—
               "Why, Harry, what ails you?"
               The young man felt in no mood to answer questions. But an answer was not needed.
                  The smoky atmosphere, and the tell-tale cigar still lying between his fingers,
                  revealed the whole truth.
               "Really! Upon my word!" fell from the young girl's lips. "Smoking! Why, Harry!
                  You're sick, are you! I'm glad of it! Serves you right! Now, ain't you ashamed of
                  yourself!"
               But Harry was, by this time, too sick to feel shame or any other emotion kindred
                  thereto. And Helen, seeing that he grew paler, began to be a little alarmed.
               "Do you feel very sick, Harry?" she asked, in a changed voice.
               "Sick as death!" murmured the young man, as the burning token of his folly dropped
                  from his fingers, and he threw himself back at full length upon the sofa with a
                  groan. His face was pale as the ashes his falling cigar had strewn about the
                  floor.
               Frightened at this, Helen ran from the room, and announced to the other members of
                  the family, in an agitated voice, that Harry was extremely ill. Mr. Lawson, the
                  father of the young man, started up in alarm and ran down to the office, followed
                  more slowly by the mother, whose limbs trembled so that she could scarcely
                  walk.
               In a few moments the experimental smoker was surrounded by some half dozen
                  persons, old and young, including even the servants of the family; yet was he still so deathly sick
                  and faint, that he did not open his eyes, nor answer the questions put to him,
                  except in a confused, scarcely audible murmur. But he could hear all that was
                  said; and some of the remarks did not in any way improve his feelings.
               "What's this?" he heard his father ask, in a quick, surprised voice. "Oh!" and the
                  tone was changed. "A cigar!—Upon my word! Here's the secret! He's been smoking.
                  Well, he deserves to be sick, that's all I have to say; the foolish fellow!"
               "Hadn't we better send for the doctor?" asked Harry's mother.
               "No. Let him get over it," replied the father. "There's no danger of his
                  dying."
               "But he's very sick."
               "The sicker the better. Served perfectly right."
               While this pleasant little chit-chat, all of which reached the ears of Harry, was
                  going on, Helen commenced bathing his face and forehead with cold water, and then
                  applied salts to his nostrils. This had the effect to revive him, and to throw off
                  the violent sickness he felt. But when he attempted to sit up his head reeled, and
                  he sank back again upon the sofa, afflicted with a most dreadful nausea.
               Finally, he was assisted to his chamber, where he hid himself in bed, and there
                  remained until the next morning, when he reappeared, feeling much like a man who
                  had been caught with a stolen sheep on his back.
               That was Harry Lawson's first cigar, and—his last one.
            
            
               
                  
                     January Bills.
                  
               
               
               JANUARY BILLS.
               THE year 18—proved a very good year for Mr. Archibald Lane. His business steadily
                  increased from the first of January, and his profits were as fair as they had ever
                  been. Heretofore, his expenses had kept so closely side by side with his income,
                  as to leave his mind oppressed with care, and in some doubt as to future success;
                  but during 18—, all had been so brisk in matters of trade, and so easy in matters
                  of money, that his mind was uniformly cheerful, and sometimes elated. He felt
                  that, at last, he was entering the way to prosperity; a way he had so long been
                  seeking earnestly to find.
               As the year drew toward its close, Mr. Lane experienced a feeling of
                  self-satisfaction unusual at such time. A doubt as to which would over-balance the
                  other, his expenses or his profits, had usually made the last week of the year one
                  of great sobriety to Mr. Lane. In 18—it was different. As the year waned, he had
                  none of the old feelings, for he was well satisfied that he would have several
                  hundred dollars on the profit side of the account, above and beyond all expenses,
                  something that had not occurred in former times.
               "If I have made both ends meet, I will be satisfied," was his usual mental
                  declaration, when he proceeded to make up his account for the year. It was
                  different now.
               "If I don't have five or six hundred dollars over, I shall be much mistaken." This
                  was the pleasant remark of Mr. Lane to himself, as he began the work of
                  ascertaining the result of his year's business. All came out pretty much as he had
                  expected. There was a balance in his
                  favour of about six hundred dollars, after a liberal margin had been allowed for
                  certain bad and doubtful accounts.
               "Things begin to look a little brighter," said Mr. Lane, as he sat alone with his
                  wife on New Year's eve. The younger children were in bed, and the two oldest
                  daughters, Kate and Emily, were out, spending the evening with a friend. This was
                  said after taking a cigar from his mouth, and letting the smoke curl lazily about
                  his head, which was reclining on the back of a cushioned rocking-chair.
               "I'm glad to hear you say so," replied Mrs. Lane. And she spoke from her heart.
                  New Year's eve had not always been a cheerful time.
               "I've been looking over my affairs to-day," continued the husband, "and find
                  myself better off than I was at this time last year, by at least six hundred
                  dollars."
               "That is encouraging."
               "I feel it so. I trust things are to be easier in future, and that we will get a
                  little beforehand in the world. It is time; for I will soon be in years, and less
                  able to give active attention to business."
               "I'm pleased on more than one account," said Mrs. Lane, "to hear that you have
                  done so well this year. I've been a good deal worried to-day about a bill that I
                  had no idea would be half as large as it is. It was sent in this morning."
               "Whose bill is that?" asked Mr. Lane, with an apparent change of feeling.
               "Mr. Mercer's bill for dry goods."
               "I didn't know there was a bill there."
               "Oh yes. Don't you remember that you told me to get whatever the family wanted
                  from him?"
               "I didn't mean to run up a bill, though."
               "It was so understood by me. But that makes little difference. If the money had
                  been paid down, the cash would not be on hand now."
               "How much is the bill?"
               "I'm 'most afraid to say."
               "How much?"
               "One hundred and thirty dollars."
               "Why, Anna! Bless my heart! How in the world could you run up a bill like
                  that?"
               "I've bought very little for myself," replied the rebuked wife, in a subdued and
                  choking voice. "Nearly all has been used for you and the children."
               "A hundred and thirty dollars! Oh dear! dear! dear!" ejaculated Mr. Lane, throwing
                  his cigar into the grate, and beginning to rock himself violently. "So much of my
                  six hundred dollars' profit scattered to the winds! I wonder how many more bills
                  you will have coming in!"
               This was downright cruel; and so Mrs. Lane felt it. She did not, however, punish
                  him for the ungenerous remark with tears, for she was not a woman disposed on all
                  occasions to give way to this weakness. Her reply was:—
               "None that the wants of the family have not required to be made."
               "But I wished you to pay cash, Anna. You know that, last January, when we were
                  almost smothered with bills from all quarters, we made a resolution to pay cash
                  for every thing during the coming year; and I thought this had been done."
               "I know very well that such a thing was talked about," replied Mrs. Lane; "and, I
                  believe, acted upon for a time. And I also know that you yourself told me to open
                  an account at Mercer's, in the spring, when I asked you for money to purchase
                  summer clothing for the family."
               "I didn't mean to have it go beyond that," said Mr. Lane, modifying his tone. "But
                  what other bills are there?"
               "There is a bill at Cheeseman's for groceries."
               "That can't be much, for I have bought almost every thing in quantities."
               "No, I don't suppose it will amount to any thing of consequence."
               "Any other bills?"
               "No; none, except the bread bill.'
               "I thought you paid cash for bread?"
               "We never did that, Mr. Lane. The baker serves us daily, marking on his
                  tally-stick the number of loaves; and once in three or six months sends in the
                  bill, when it is paid."
               
               "How long has his bill been running?"
               "Six months, I believe."
               "And will be forty or fifty dollars."
               "Not half of it," replied Mrs. Lane.
               "Well, what else is there?"
               "Nothing more, I believe."
               "I hope not. Here are about two hundred dollars cut off at a blow from the
                  supposed profits of the year. Confound these bills! I wish there was no such thing
                  as credit."
               Mr. Lane was, as a matter of course, unhappy from that moment. Had these bills not
                  existed, and the surplus of the year shown the pleasant aggregate of four hundred
                  dollars, he would have been quite as happy as when he figured it up at six
                  hundred. But, in imagination, he had been better off by two hundred dollars than
                  the truth now discovered him to be, and the loss was felt as real. The remainder
                  of the evening passed gloomily enough. When Mr. Lane retired to bed, he could not
                  sleep for thinking of the dry goods, grocery, and bread bills. While he thus lay
                  awake, memory assisted him to the knowledge of two or three other little matters
                  of the same kind. There was an unsettled tailor's bill that might take twenty-five
                  or thirty dollars to balance; and the boot-maker had something against him. Ten
                  bushels of potatoes and three barrels of apples that he had ordered sent home in
                  October, were yet to be paid for. At least fifty dollars more of his year's
                  profits vanished.
               At last, Mr. Lane fell asleep, and dreamed all night of bills that came almost in
                  a shower around him. On New Year morning, he sat silent and moody at the
                  breakfast-table, eating but little, and looking no one in the face. All were
                  oppressed by his state of mind, though none but his wife knew its nature and the
                  cause from which it was produced.
               It was early when Mr. Lane went to his place of business on the morning of the
                  first of January; not so early, however, but that one or two persons had preceded
                  him, and left behind them visible tokens of the fact. On his desk were a couple of
                  sealed notes. He opened them with a vague presentiment of something disagreeable,
                  and he was not disappointed. The first contained a narrow slip of paper, with a
                  printed head, and certain written characters and figures below, which plainly
                  enough expressed the fact that he was indebted to a certain dealer in groceries in
                  the sum of seventy-six dollars.
               "Oh dear!" was the mental exclamation of pain that followed the perusal of this
                  bill. That a little piece of paper, three or four inches wide and six inches long,
                  should have such power over the feelings of a man!
               The next billet was opened with a more nervous state of mind. As he broke the seal
                  and displaced the envelope, another narrow piece of paper, folded over from the
                  ends in three sections, dropped upon the desk. It was the bread bill for six
                  months, and called for forty-four dollars and ten cents.
               "Is it possible? Too bad! too bad! too bad! I had no idea of this."
               Thus the unhappy man expressed his feelings. While yet holding this bill in his
                  hand, a lad entered the store; and, coming back to the desk where he sat, politely
                  handed him an ominous piece of paper, and retired. He opened it, and read:—
               "Mr. Archibald Lane—Bought of," &c.
               The particulars were, an air-tight stove, at twelve dollars; a cooking-stove, at
                  thirty; and various other matters of Russia pipe, fire-boards, etc., in all,
                  amounting to fifty-five dollars.—Though the genial heat from the air-tight stove
                  had comforted Mr. Lane every evening since it came home, and he had enjoyed the
                  improved cooking of the new addition to the kitchen department, he had entirely
                  forgotten that the bill for these increased advantages had never been settled.
               "I declare!" he exclaimed, half aloud, and striking the desk as he spoke. "How
                  came I to forget that bill! I meant to have paid it when the articles came home,
                  and told Jenkins to send it in."
               Soon after this, Mr. Lane's young man came in from the post-office. There were
                  three letters, each with the city post-mark, and each with a bill enclosed. One,
                  the tailor's bill, called for forty-eight dollars; another was from a hatter, and
                  demanded five; and the third came from
                  a jobbing carpenter, who had been called in at sundry times to mend and make, and
                  asked for the sum of twenty-three dollars, ninety-two cents.
               Mr. Lane read them over, and then placed them under a paper-weight on his desk,
                  uttering, at the same time, a long-drawn sigh.
               The morning paper was yet unread. It lay on the desk beside Mr. Lane; and from
                  habit more than from any desire to know its contents, he opened it and commenced
                  reading. An occurrence of some interest had taken place in a neighbouring city;
                  and he was in the midst of a narrative of the event, and much interested in it,
                  when he started and turned quickly at the sound of a voice near him. A man had
                  entered, and was standing at his elbow.
               "Good morning, Mr. Lane," said the man.
               "Good morning, Williams," returned Mr. Lane. "Can I do any thing for you to-day!"
                  he added, in a tone of affected cheerfulness.
               "Not much," said the visitor, removing his hat as he spoke, and taking therefrom a
                  small package of papers, which he commenced turning over.
               "You hav'nt a bill against me?" Mr. Lane spoke confidently.
               "What do you call that?" replied the man, as he drew a slip of paper from the
                  package in his hand, and presented it.
               "One barrel of flour; five hams; a bushel of corn-meal, and a sack of salt. Bless
                  me! Didn't I pay for these at the time?"
               The man smiled, and shook his head.
               "Why, it's nine months since I made the purchase! And I'm certain I told you to
                  send in the bill. I never like small matters of this kind to stand."
               "It's been overlooked. But the money will be just as good now," was the pleasant
                  answer.
               With as good a grace as it was possible for him to assume, Mr. Lane turned to his
                  desk, and drawing forth his pocket-book, counted out thirteen dollars; saying, as
                  he did so,
               "The next time I make a bill at your store, I wish you to send it in before the
                  first of January."
               "I won't promise," was good-humouredly replied, as the man bowed and withdrew. The
                  pleasure was all on his side, and he could afford to be in a good humour.
               "I hope that's the last," said Mr. Lane," said Mr. Lane as he would this string of
                  his great pocket-book around and around its distended sides, and then laid it
                  carefully back in his desk. But he was in error. Ere the day passed, his bootmaker
                  sent in his bill, amounting to fifteen dollars; and from a ladies' shoemaker came
                  a like token, footed up with the sum of twenty dollars more. An upholsterer had
                  been called upon to make a chamber-carpet, and do sundry little matters about the
                  house during the year; and he called for eight dollars and thirty-four cents. Then
                  the jobbing cabinet-maker had his account to settle with Mr. Lane, for sundry
                  applications of his art to broken-backed chairs, rickety tables, loose veneering,
                  etc. etc., for all of which he wanted sixteen dollars. Thus it went on, hour after
                  hour, until toward evening. The glazier called for two dollars and a half; the
                  tinner presented a bill for five dollars; and the gas-fitter for eight.
               By this time, human patience, at least so far as Mr. Lane was concerned, had
                  become wellnigh exhausted. He felt like making a very severe application of his
                  foot to any man or boy who might again invade his premises with a bill. He was
                  sitting at his desk, in this not very amiable mood, with the bills he had received
                  since morning spread out before him, and a slip of paper in his hand, upon which
                  the whole of the sums they called for, amounting to four hundred and sixty-nine
                  dollars and eighty-six cents, had been added up, when he heard the door open and
                  shut. Turning, with a nervous start, he saw the familiar face of an old negro who
                  had polished his boots for the last half dozen years. He knew his errand, and felt
                  that this was like adding insult to injury. Peter came shuffling back toward the
                  desk at which Lane remained seated with contracted brows, revealing, at each step,
                  more and more, of his polished ivory.
               "Little bill, massa Lane," said the negro, producing, as he spoke, a dingy piece
                  of paper.
               This was too much. It was an ordeal beyond what overtried patience could bear.
               
               "Clear out, you black rascal!" exclaimed the sufferer, in a passionate voice. "If
                  you say 'bill' to me, I'll cut your ears off!"
               Such an unexpected reception from "Massa Lane," who had been looked upon by Peter
                  as one of the most amiable men in the world, completely astounded the poor negro;
                  and he beat a hasty retreat, glancing back every now and then to see if an
                  inkstand or paper-weight were not advancing in the direction of his head with
                  something like lightning speed.
               To sudden storms there always follows a deep calm. By the time Peter had vanished
                  through the door, retiring at a velocity which could not have been greatly
                  increased at a velocity which could not have been greatly increased had a pack of
                  wolves been at his heels, Mr. Lane's mind was trembling back from its state of
                  uncontrollable excitement. Laying his face down upon the desk, he sighed heavily.
                  Mortification took the place of irritation, and anger against others was succeeded
                  by anger against himself.
               "Ah me!" was breathed forth heavily, at last; and raising himself up, he gathered
                  together the bills that were spread out before him, and thrusting them into the
                  desk, turned the key with a firm hand, making the lock click as the bolt sprang to
                  its place.
               When Mr. Lane went home that evening, his mind was calm. He had passed through a
                  day of sad trial and disappointment; but he knew the worst, and was prepared for
                  it. When the milk bill, milliner's and mantuamaker's bills, and sundry other
                  little bills were laid before him, he exhibited no emotion. They were to his
                  feelings like a gentle breeze after a violent tempest. But on one thing he was
                  resolved; and that was, to pay cash in future for every thing.
               "There must be no January bills next year," said he to his family, after he had
                  looked at the sum to pay long enough to be able to speak on the subject without
                  visible emotion. "Let cash be paid for every thing in the time to come. If the
                  money isn't in hand when the want presents itself, let the want wait!"
               This was a good resolution. But did Mr. Lane and his family abide by it? Next
                  January will tell.
            
            
               
                  
               
               DISCOVERING A LEAK.
               "PLEASE, mim, the butter is all out," said Nancy, thrusting her face into the door
                  of the room where Mrs. Peabody sat sewing.
               "Impossible!" was the lady's reply. "Impossible, Nancy."
               "Indade, mim, and there ain't enough for supper."
               "What has become of it, Nancy?" asked Mrs. Peabody.
               "I bought four pounds day before yesterday. It's impossible! It can't be all
                  gone."
               "Faith and alive, thin, Mrs. Peabody, and sure it's been used."
               
               Never!"
               The lady was positive in her assertion that the butter had not been fairly
                  disposed of; while Nancy quite as positively maintained the affirmative of the
                  question at issue between them. The result was, Mrs. Peabody had to buy more
                  butter, and continue in darkness as to the ways and means by which four pounds of
                  that necessary article of table comfort had vanished in about two days.
               "The white sugar is all out," said Nancy, after break-fast on the next
                  morning.
               "The white sugar out! Are you certain, Nancy?"
               "Yis, indade. There ain't the full of a tae-cup in the house."
               "Didn't Mr. Brown send home ten pounds of sugar on Saturday?"
               "I don't think there were ten pounds, mim."
               "Well, I do, then. I know there were ten pounds. We always get ten pounds at a
                  time. Are you sure there is none in the box?"
               "Sure and sartin, mim."
               "It's very strange! Ten pounds of white sugar in five days! What have you done
                  with it, Nancy?"
               "Me done with it, mim! And do yees mane to insineate that I wouldn't act
                  honestly?"
               "I don't insinuate any thing, Nancy; I only ask what has been done with ten pounds
                  of sugar in five days? It was placed in your keeping, and it's gone. Now I only
                  desire to know how it has been disposed of."
               "It's been used in the family, in course," said Nancy.
               "No: that is impossible. We only use white sugar for tea and coffee twice a day.
                  Ten pounds, properly taken care of, ought to last two weeks."
               "Not if the children are allowed to ate it as they do."
               "Who allows them to eat it? I'm sure I don't," said Mrs. Peabody.
               "I can't keep them from it," replied Nancy.
               "The children never ate all that sugar."
               "Well, mim, it's gone," said Nancy.
               And that was about all the satisfaction Mrs. Peabody could get.
               Not only did sugar and butter vanish thus unaccountably bly, but flour and meal,
                  soap and starch, and other things too various to mention.
               "I can't stand this," said Mr. Peabody, when his quarter's bill of groceries came
                  in. "One hundred and forty-eight dollars!"
               "Not that much, surely," said Mrs. Peabody.
               "Yes; one hundred and forty-eight. We never had a bill like this before."
               "Isn't there some mistake? Perhaps Brown has sent you the wrong bill and
                  pass-book."
               Mr. Peabody referred to the cover of the pass-book, and read—
               "'Henry Peabody, in account,' &c. It's our book, you see."
               "There's something wrong," persisted Mrs. Peabody.
               "That I will readily admit," replied her husband.
               "But where is it?"
               "May be the book is not added up right," suggested the lady.
               Mr. Peabody hurriedly added up page after page of the book.
               "All correct, so far as that is concerned."
               "Then we are charged with more than we received," said Mrs. Peabody.
               "No; I don't believe that. But, to be certain, let me read off the different
                  articles."
               This was done; and Mrs. Peabody could not positively say that any charge was
                  wrong, although the entries of tea, sugar, coffee, oil, butter, and lard, were
                  remarkably frequent.
               "If it's all come into the house, it hasn't all been eaten," said Mrs. Peabody, in
                  a positive tone of voice.
               "Then there must be a leak somewhere," said her husband.
               "I'm afraid there is; but how are we to discover it? Nancy's a very extravagant
                  cook, and lays a heavy hand upon every thing. I believe she wastes more than her
                  wages amount to."
               "She must have a heavy hand to make things go after this fashion. Are you sure
                  she's honest?"
               "I've seen nothing to make me think differently."
               
               "Have you talked to her about the way things go?"
               "Oh yes," replied Mrs. Peabody; "over and over again. But it does no good. She
                  declares that every thing which comes to the house is used in the house; and what,
                  then, can I say? I shouldn't like to accuse an innocent person of stealing."
               "It's rather a serious matter to accuse any one of that crime. But there's a leak
                  somewhere, and we must find it."
               "I wish I knew how to find it," said Mrs. Peabody, despondingly.
               "Human ingenuity is equal to any thing. We must find the leak, Anna."
               And, in good earnest, Mr. and Mrs. Peabody set to work to find the leak.
               Among the frequent visitors of Nancy the cook, was a woman who always carried a
                  basket and wore a cloak. This person Mrs. Peabody often met in the kitchen, and,
                  as she was introduced by Nancy as a poor woman in bad health, with several young
                  children, the lady's feelings were interested in her favour, and she often made
                  her presents of old clothing, and sometimes gave her flour and tea.
               Nancy had known this woman in Ireland, and spoke of her as having seen better
                  days. Particularly did she dwell upon the honest character she had borne at home.
                  In this way a very favourable impression was made upon Mrs. Peabody.
               "What old woman was that I saw coming out through the basement to-day?" asked Mr.
                  Peabody, on coming home one evening rather earlier than usual.
               "Had she on an old brown camblet cloak?"
               "Yes."
               "Oh, she's a poor woman who comes to see Nancy sometimes."
               "And does she always bring her basket along?" inquired Mr. Peabody.
               "Why do you ask that?" said the lady.
               "I guess you'll find the leak you spoke of there."
               "Oh no! oh no! I don't believe the old creature would take any thing which was not
                  given to her."
               "That may be. But are you fully advised as to the extent of Nancy's
                  generosity?"
               "I don't believe she would take any thing, unless it was cold meat or broken
                  bread."
               "Have you ever looked into her basket?"
               "No."
               "How often does she come?"
               "Two or three times a week, I believe."
               "O mother," spoke up a bright-looking boy, who was an attentive listener. "She's
                  here every day, and sometimes twice a day."
               "Indeed! You're sure of that, Harry?" said Mr. Peabody.
               "Oh yes, sir."
               "Did you ever see Nancy give her any thing?"
               "I saw her put a great chunk of butter in her basket yesterday."
               "Indeed!"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Any thing else?"
               "Some papers. I don't know what was in them, though."
               "Did Nancy see you when she did this?" asked Mr. Peabody.
               "No, sir. I was looking in at the window."
               "Henry's mistaken. I can't believe it," said Mrs. Peabody, in a positive
                  voice.
               "It will be an easy matter to settle. The next time she comes, take the liberty to
                  look into her basket."
               "No, I wouldn't like to do that."
               "Look into her basket, Anna, and, my word for it, you'll find the leak."
               Mrs. Peabody shook her head positively at this suggestion.
               "If I catch her here, I shall most certainly do it," said Mr. Peabody.
               "You'll only hurt the old woman's feelings. It's bad enough to be poor, without
                  having suspicion added thereto."
               "Poverty is no crime; but carrying off pounds of butter ter, sugar, and flour, not to mention a dozen other
                  things, can hardly be called honest."
               "I don't believe she does it, Henry."
               "It will be more agreeable to know that she does not, than to let the present
                  state of doubt remain. If you don't look into her basket, I will."
               Not a long time passed before Mr. Peabody had the opportunity he desired. A little
                  earlier than usual, he came home on the next day; and, just as he reached his own
                  door, up from the basement area came the old woman with the basket. Said basket
                  had a dark piece of woollen cloth, or baize, covered over it, and was, moreover,
                  partly concealed under the woman's cloak. Nancy had come out with her, and stood
                  in the area. Neither of them saw Mr. Peabody at first, but he soon manifested
                  presence; for the moment he saw the woman, he stepped up to her, and drawing the
                  covering from her basket, said—
               "What have we here?"
               Mr. Peabody spoke in a quick, stern voice.
               Nancy, the moment she saw what he had done, turned and went back hurriedly into
                  the house; the woman stood for a moment with a face of dismay, and then dropping
                  the basket, beat a hasty retreat.
               "I thought I'd discover the leak," said Mr. Peabody, as he entered his wife's
                  room, bearing in his hand the old woman's basket, which, on examination, was found
                  to contain, besides various other articles, the following, fully recognised as the
                  property of Mr. and Mrs. Peabody:—
               One pound of butter; about a pound and a quarter of loaf sugar; three links of
                  sausage, and one loaf of bread. Of the tea and coffee in papers, the freshly cut
                  half-pound squares of soap, the nutmegs, and the dozen other little matters of the
                  kind, it was uncertain whether they had been abstracted from this or some other
                  house in which a leak existed.
               Mrs. Peabody was confounded; and so was Nancy, when summoned from the kitchen. Of
                  course, Nancy had no suspicion that the old woman was dishonest, and stoutly
                  maintained that not an article found in her basket had been taken from Mrs.
                  Peabody's kitchen.
               Rather doubting this, with so much evidence before her, Mrs. Peabody had the
                  resolution to dismiss Nancy on the spot; and the act was effectual in stopping the
                  leak. After that, butter and sugar went twice as far as before, and the next
                  quarterly bill for groceries reached only the sum of eighty-one dollars.
               In more families than that of Mr. Peabody would a leak be discovered, if old-women
                  visitors to the kitchen, with cloaks and baskets, were occasionally overhauled.
                  There are a goodly number of them about, and the way they make grocery bills run
                  up, is afflicting to a man whose purse is not deep, and well filled with
                  Californias at that.
            
            
               
               THE ELOPEMENT.
               "YOUNG man, it is useless to urge this matter. In declining you offer of an
                  alliance with my family, I am in earnest."
               "I am not content with a simple rejection of my suit, Mr. Carlton. I give reasons
                  for my own conduct, and like to have reasons for all acts affecting myself. Will
                  you say why I am not deemed worthy to claim the hand of one whose heart I already
                  possess? Is not my family as good as yours?"
               The young man spoke eagerly, while his brows were knit and his eyes firmly fixed
                  on those of the person he addressed.
               "William," said Mr. Carlton, manifesting a good deal of excitement as he spoke, "I
                  do not recognise your right to demand of me reasons for my conduct. I will say,
                  however, that the happiness of my child is in my keeping as a natural right, and I
                  am bound to protect her in every possible way. I regard only her happiness when I
                  decline the offer made for her hand. I know the heart of Jessie well, and know
                  that, if committed to your keeping, it will be a broken heart in less than five
                  years—it may be in less than one."
               "I love your daughter, Mr. Carlton," replied the young man to this. "Why should I
                  break the heart of one I love?"
               "William Levering, such love as yours falls upon the heart as a blight, not a
                  blessing. I know you well, your principles and your life—both are bad."
               
                  
                     The Elopement.
                  
               
               
               A red spot burned on the young man's cheek, and his eyes flashed. But Mr. Carlton
                  looked calmly at him.
               "Think," he added; "picture to yourself one of your companions in vice approaching
                  your own sister, and offering the love of his corrupt heart. Would you not step
                  between, abandoned as you are, and risk your very life, rather than permit the
                  sacrifice?"
               "Mr. Carlton," said Levering, "I cannot permit you, nor any one else, to insult
                  and outrage me in this way."
               "As you like," returned the other, coldly. "You ask reasons for my conduct, but
                  are not willing to hear them."
               For a short time, there was silence, the young man standing in an attitude of
                  irresolution. Then muttering something in an under tone, he retired from the
                  presence of Mr. Carlton.
               A few hours afterward, a servant tapped softly at the chamber door of Miss
                  Carlton, the young lady referred to in the brief conversation just given.
               "What do you want, Philip?" asked Jessie, as she opened the door.
               The servant slipped a sealed note into her hand, with an air of secrecy, and then
                  retired.
               Quickly re-entering her room, and turning the key, Jessie broke the envelop of the
                  billet she had received, and read what was written within. The communication was
                  from her lover.
               "I have seen your father," said he, "as you so earnestly desired, and the result
                  of the interview is just what I expected. He was not content with an angry denial
                  of my suit, but threw me off with smarting insult. He says I cannot make you
                  happy. Heaven knows how ardently I desire to fill your cup with joy, even until it
                  overrun the brim. If the passionate love of a sincere heart can make you happy,
                  Jessie, then you whole life will be blessed. I cannot imagine the ground of his
                  dislike toward me. I have never injured him nor his. This opposition on his part
                  makes me wretched. Are we, then, to remain ever separate? or will you leave all,
                  and throw yourself into my arms? I shall await your answer to this in the wildest
                  impatience. When you have made up your mind, place your answer in the hands of
                  Philip.
               
               He will keep our secret inviolate; for he is under obligations to me of the
                  strongest character."
               "My heart is wholly yours," wrote Jessie, in reply.
               "Shall heart and person longer be separated?" answered Levering. "To-morrow week,
                  I hear, your father will leave home, to be gone several days. This I learn from
                  Philip. What better opportunity to pass from his protection to mine?"
               Two days elapsed, and then the maiden wrote—"Let it be, as you desire."
               Weak and foolish maiden! In that decision how much was involved! Not the happiness
                  of a day or year, but, it might be, of a whole lifetime.
               What Mr. Carlton had said to Levering of his principles and his life, was true.
                  Both were bad, and very bad. He did not truly love Jessie, for of that he was
                  incapable. No man who lacks virtue can love a woman truly. It is a moral
                  impossibility.
               Levering had first turned his thoughts to marriage because it was necessary, as he
                  said to himself, to form such an alliance. He belonged to a wealthy family, and,
                  by marrying into a family of equal wealth and standing, he would take proper care
                  of the future. Of course, he must have a beautiful and accomplished wife. In
                  looking around him, no one struck the young man's fancy so strongly as Jessie
                  Carlton: and, after weighing all in favour and against an alliance with her
                  family, decided to storm the citadel of her heart. Handsome, intelligent, and with
                  a good address, he was not long in making the impression he desired. Jessie
                  Carlton's young heart was quickly won.
               Philip, a servant in the family of Mr. Carlton, whom Levering had secured to his
                  interest, was informed of the intended elopement, and employed to give such aid as
                  his position would afford. Of course, the utmost secrecy was enjoined upon him;
                  and his faithfulness was sought to be secured by threats as well as promises. But
                  Philip found it hard to bear up alone under a secret of such great importance; he
                  wanted some one to share with him the heavy burden. So, confiding in the
                  discretion of another servant in the house, a female, he divulged to her, after
                  first obtaining her promise not to betray what he was about to communicate, the
                  fact of Jessie's intended flight.
               On the night previous to the day on which Mr. Carlton was to leave home, he sat up
                  late, engaged in writing. It was past eleven o'clock, when there was a light tap
                  at his door, which was opened immediately, and a female servant glided in
                  noiselessly, closing softly the door after her.
               "Well, Hannah?" said he in a voice of inquiry, as she approached him, in a
                  somewhat agitated manner.
               Hannah sank into a chair, so much disturbed that it was some moments before she
                  could speak.
               "Mr. Carlton," she at length said, "oh! I have something dreadful to tell
                  you."
               "For heaven's sake, Hannah, speak out quickly, then! What has happened?" exclaimed
                  Mr. Carlton, agitated in turn.
               "Nothing has happened yet; but, if you go away tomorrow, it will happen. Oh, sir,
                  do not go away."
               "Hannah, what is the meaning of this? Speak out plainly at once."
               "Miss Jessie—"
               "Jessie! What of her?"
               "She is going off with Mr. Levering."
               "When? Where is she?" The father was on his feet, and moving toward the door.
                  "Speak, girl!"
               "Oh, sir, don't be frightened," said Hannah; "it isn't to-night. Miss Jessie is in
                  her room. I have only come to tell you about it in time."
               "Ah! thank you, my faithful Hannah."
               Mr. Carlton spoke in a calmer voice; and, returning to the secretary where he had
                  been writing, sat down again.
               "Now," he added, "tell me all you know about this matter."
               "All I know," replied Hannah, "I got to-day from Philip. He told me that he has
                  been carrying letters from Mr. Levering to Jessie and back again, for some time,
                  and that it is all arranged for her to go off with him, just at daylight, the
                  morning after you leave home."
               "Can it be possible? Mad girl!" exclaimed Mr. Carlton, passionately. "And you are sure of all
                  this, Hannah?"
               "Philip told me, and I'm afraid it is all true."
               "Very well, Hannah. I thank you from my heart for this act of duty. You have saved
                  Jessie, it may be, from a lifetime of misery. Mr. Levering is a bad man, and if
                  she marries him, he will make her wretched. Foolish, foolish girl! Could she not
                  believe her father?"
               After some further conference, the girl left the room; and Mr. Carlton, closing
                  his secretary, walked the floor for the space of an hour ere retiring. On the next
                  day, greatly to the surprise of Hannah, he left home at the time previously
                  appointed.
               No sleep weighed down the eyelids of Jessie Carlton, during the night that
                  succeeded. Through the long hours that intervened from the time the family retired
                  until the hand of Aurora gently raised the curtain of darkness from the east, she
                  either walked the floor of her chamber or lay wakeful upon the bed. At early dawn,
                  she was to pass from beneath her father's roof and from under his protection,
                  committing unto another her destiny. Well might her heart tremble and grow faint
                  as she tried to look into the dark future; well might she shrink back, half
                  repentant, and hesitate about the step she had resolved to take. The silent
                  midnight gives to the wakeful solemn thoughts. Such thoughts came to Jessie; and,
                  as the winds sighed through the trees or moaned beneath the eaves, it seemed as if
                  a spirit were addressing her in tones of warning.
               At last, a feeble line of light was seen upon the horizon; and it gradually
                  widened until the dawn appeared. Hurriedly throwing a shawl around her, Jessie
                  stood for some minutes near the window, as if awaiting an expectant signal.
                  Presently, a hand was laid upon the lock. Silently crossing the room, she opened
                  the door. Philip stood there with his finger on his lip.
               "Is all right?" asked Jessie, in a low, agitated whisper.
               "All is right," returned the man. "Be quick; he is waiting for you."
               Gliding through the door, Jessie went noiselessly down stairs. As she passed into
                  the open air, Levering received her, handing, as he did so, a purse of money to
                  the treacherous servant as his promised reward.
               A few minutes prior to this, a scene even more exciting took place a short
                  distance from the mansion of Mr. Carlton, where a carriage stood in waiting for
                  the fugitive. The driver had left his box, and was standing near his horses, when,
                  suddenly, a man was by his side, pistol in hand, uttering, in a low, peremptory
                  voice, "Silence, and you are safe!"
               The driver started back a few paces in alarm; while the stranger who had presented
                  his weapon, kept it directed toward him.
               "Now leave these grounds as quickly as you can go," said the intruder.
               The driver hesitated, when the sharp click of the pistol-lock was heard.
               "Go, instantly!" repeated the man. "Your horses and carriage are safe. You will
                  find them at the Stag and Hound in an hour from this. Now go, if you set the value
                  of a hair upon your life."
               The driver, by this time thoroughly alarmed, fled. As soon as he had left the
                  ground, the stranger mounted the box and grasped the reins. Hardly had he taken
                  his place, ere Levering and Jessie appeared, and hurriedly entered the
                  carriage.
               "Where did you say I must drive?" inquired the man, leaning over from the box.
               "To Mr. Liston's. And see that no grass grows beneath your horses' feet."
               The man spoke sharply to the spirited animals, and away they dashed at full speed.
                  Liston was a minister, who had been engaged to perform the marriage service for
                  Levering and Jessie. He lived in the town which lay a short distance from the
                  beautiful country residence of Mr. Carlton. In a few minutes, the horses were
                  reined up at the dwelling of the minister, when Levering sprang from the carriage,
                  and lifting Jessie, as she attempted to descend, actually bore her in his arms
                  across the pavement and into the house. Just as the fugitives disappeared, another
                  vehicle drove up at a rapid pace. The self-constituted driver of Levering's
                  carriage left his own horses, and
                  hurrying to the door of the second carriage, spoke rapidly a few words to some one
                  within; and then turning away entered the minister's house, and throwing off his
                  rough hat and coat in the hall, presented the figure of a well-dressed gentleman.
                  For a few moments he stood as if awaiting some one, while his ear was bent toward
                  the door of a room that opened from the passage, to hear what was going on within.
                  Then he placed his hand on this door, and gently pushing it open, entered. The
                  young couple were already on the floor; and the minister, in his robes, stood
                  before them, ready to begin the ceremony. So softly had the stranger entered, that
                  no one perceived his presence but the minister, who did not permit the intrusion
                  to interfere with what he was doing. He began, and progressed until he came to
                  that part of the ceremony in which it is demanded of those present, to show cause
                  why the parties about to be joined in holy wedlock cannot lawfully enter that
                  state, when the door of the room was thrown suddenly open, and a woman rushed in,
                  exclaiming, "I forbid this marriage!"
               "Who are you, and by what right do you speak?" inquired the minister, in an
                  agitated voice.
               Levering and Jessie started at this unexpected interruption; and, turning, looked
                  in astonishment both at the woman and the man.
               "Miss Carlton," said the woman, coming up to Jessie and grasping her arm, "you
                  have no right to this man; he belongs to me by a prior claim, that I will not see
                  cancelled. There is your natural protector"—and she drew her, with a sudden jerk,
                  across the room toward the man who had entered just before her—"your father. And,
                  in heaven's name, let not a man like this tempt you thus madly from his side
                  again!"
               Jessie scarcely heard the closing words of the sentence. Overcome by so dreadful a
                  termination of her elopement, she sank into the arms of her father—for it was he
                  who had driven her to the minister's.
               Before the vile companion of his evil hours, Levering stood, for a few moments,
                  covered with shame and confusion.
               "Now go, young man," said Mr. Carlton, sternly, as he supported the form of his
                  child; "go with this vile, unhappy creature, whom you have reduced from virtue to
                  a level with yourself. Go, consort with her as your equal; but dream not again of
                  an alliance with the pure being I have saved from your unhallowed grasp. She can
                  never be yours. If, before, you could deceive her into the belief that you were an
                  angel of light, the power of deception is now gone, for you stand before her in
                  all your native corruption and deformity. Go, sir!"
               Confounded by a denouement so painful and humiliating, Levering, as soon as he
                  could collect his bewildered senses, sprung from the room. As he gained the open
                  air, the driver who had been so suddenly deprived of his carriage, came up.
                  Levering hurriedly entered the vehicle, exclaiming—"Drive me home!"
               The man needed not a second invitation to mount his box. Quick as thought, he had
                  the reins in his hands, and the horses were soon springing before him at a
                  gallop.
               The reader doubtless understands all this without further explanation; and
                  Levering had few inquiries to make ere he comprehended the whole affair to more
                  than his entire satisfaction. As for Jessie, she, too, understood enough to make
                  her heart sink in her bosom and tremble, whenever she thought of the narrow escape
                  she had made from an alliance that could only have produced wretchedness, if it
                  would not have borne her down to the grave, in a few short years, with a broken
                  heart.
            
            
               
               THE DROP GAME.
               "COME, Laban Lee," said the post-master of a certain village in New Jersey,
                  situated within ten miles of Philadelphia—"You must take a paper this year. How
                  can you live, man, without the news?"
               "The news!" returned Lee. "Humph! I have more news now than is agreeable. In fact,
                  I don't believe in your newsmongers, no how. Every man mind his own business—that
                  is my motto."
               "Yes, but friend Lee, it is of interest to know what is going on in the
                  world."
               "No special interest to me. What do I care about other people's concerns? It won't
                  make my cows give more milk, nor my land grow more bushels to the acre."
               "I am not so sure of that."
               "Ain't you?"
               "No."
               "Well, I am then."
               "There are farmers whose cows give more milk than yours, and whose land yields a
                  better increase. From these you might learn something to your advantage."
               "But what has that to do with newspapers?"
               "A great deal. Intelligent farmers inform the public of their agricultural
                  experiments; and give the new methods by which they obtain large yields of
                  produce."
               "Book-farming!" exclaimed Laban Lee, in a tone of contempt. "Never believed in it;
                  and never expect to. The good old-fashioned way is good enough for me. Industry
                  and economy—that is my motto, and I teach it
                     The Drop Game.
                  
                   daily to my children. Hand-work is
                  worth all the newspapers in the world."
               "I am not so sure of that," returned the post-master.
               "Hand-work is badly off without head-work, and will soon find itself in the
                  rear."
               "I'm not in the least anxious," said Lee, with a self-satisfied air, as he turned
                  off and went on his way toward the city, his tubs well filled with butter, and his
                  wagon loaded with a goodly stock of poultry and fruit. "A bird in the hand is
                  worth two in the bush,"—he kept on talking to himself. "When there is a dollar in
                  my pocket, I know what I've got. But if I spend it for a newspaper, what is there
                  to show for it? I never knew any good to come of taking the papers. They only put
                  nonsense into the young people's heads, and make them think themselves wiser than
                  their parents. Dad! and they shan't come into my house."
               Laban Lee, if the truth must be told, had a sordid love of money. The dollar was
                  always held so close to the axis of vision, that little beyond the round bright
                  coin was ever discernible. By hard work, industry and economy, he had gradually
                  gained upon the world, until he was the owner of a snug piece of ground covering
                  about fifty acres, well stocked, and as well tilled as his "good old-fashioned"
                  way of farming would permit.
               The over-careful in saving, when love of money subdues almost every other
                  sentiment, are not generally over honest in getting. The every-one-for-himself
                  principle of action generally leads to a disregard of other's interests, a
                  trespass upon other's rights, and a departure from truth in dealing. Into these
                  defects Laban Lee naturally fell, as many a citizen, who had bought tough
                  chickens, bad butter, and spoiled turkeys, from the "fair and honest countryman,"
                  could testify. Lee knew how much was gained in these transactions; but never had
                  any idea of how much he lost. Far oftener than any of his customers guessed, his
                  butter, or at least a carefully arranged portion contained in his tubs, lacked
                  several ounces of the true weight; and more than once had he come near losing a
                  goodly number thereof, at the hands of the Clerk of the Market. Such a man was
                  Laban Lee.
               
               As the countryman wended his way toward the city, his thoughts were busy in
                  summing up the probable amount he would receive for the contents of his
                  market-wagon; yet this occupied state of mind did not keep his eyes from resting
                  with intelligent discrimination upon the road he travelled. Money, and articles of
                  value had been found by others, and why might he not be so fortunate? Such things
                  were frequently lost by the careless. The idea of restitution never occurred to
                  him; this was kept obscured by the pleasurable anticipation of gain, as the finder
                  of lost property. Once, and only once, had Laban Lee been fortunate. On a certain
                  occasion as he walked along the road, he espied, a short distance in advance, a
                  bright object partially concealed in the sand. Eagerly he sprung forward, snatched
                  it from the ground, and was rewarded by obtaining half a dollar! Small as the sum
                  was, to gain it thus, awoke in his mind the most pleasing sensations. From that
                  time, whether in town or country, few square rods of earth or pavement over which
                  he passed escaped his watchful eyes.
               On the present occasion, notwithstanding Lee examined the road by which he
                  travelled to the city with his usual care, no treasure was found. Better fortune,
                  however, attended him on the day following. He had sold out his better, poultry,
                  and fruit, and over thirty dollars received in exchange therefor, were in his
                  pocket. Prices had ranged pretty high, and the farmer felt satisfied with his
                  sales. Just as he was preparing to leave, the sudden exclamation of a man by his
                  side startled him, and turning quickly, he saw a gentlemanly looking stranger,
                  with a well filled pocket-book in his hand.
               "Somebody's dropped this!" said the stranger, addressing Lee. "And it's filled
                  with money."
               The farmer's eyes were instantly distended. He felt his knees tremble.
               "Is it your's, friend?" inquired the stranger, blandly.
               Lee could with difficulty refrain from saying that it was. But he forced out the
                  words—
               "No; I believe not."
               "What's to pay?" half carelessly inquired a third party, coming up at this
                  moment.
               "Somebody's lost a pocket-book," was replied.
               "Indeed! Much money in it?"
               "It's full. See there!"
               And the possessor of the book showed the folds and edges of a large bundle of bank
                  bills.
               "Gracious me! What are you going to do with it?"
               "I don't know, I'm sure. It's not mine. Whoever lost it ought to have it. But, as
                  I am a stranger in the city, and shall leave in an hour, it will be impossible for
                  me to restore it. No doubt a large reward will be offered for its recovery, in the
                  morning papers. What's to be done? I'm really in a quandary."
               "You ought to get the reward," said the second comer.
               "For you are the finder."
               "True," replied the man. "But I can't possibly remain in the city until to-morrow.
                  To-night must see me in New York."
               "If you choose to take it," said the person who came up last, "I will give you
                  fifty dollars for your chance in the reward."
               "Fifty dollars," was the musing reply. "I don't know what to say about that. The
                  reward will doubtless be two or three hundred. There can't be less than twenty
                  thousand dollars in the pocket-book."
               "I wouldn't like to risk more," was the half-indifferent response to this.
               The possessor of the pocket-book seemed irresolute for some moments.
               "Well," he at length said, "take it. But I think you are driving on me a very hard
                  bargain."
               The other thrust his hand into his pocket, and after feeling about there for some
                  moments, said—
               "That's unfortunate! I've left my pocket-book at the store. But come with me, and
                  I'll give you fifty dollars."
               "Where is your store?"
               "On the wharf."
               "Oh dear! No, I'm not going away down there."
               Then turning to Laban Lee, the stranger said, in the most insinuating manner,
               "Why can't you take it, friend?"
               
               "Havn't got fifty dollars," replied Lee, his eyes fairly gloating on the
                  pocket-book.
               "How much have you?"
               "Only thirty."
               The man shrugged his shoulders, and shook his head.
               "You'd better come down to my store, No.—, South Wharves. I'll give you fifty
                  dollars. Or, if you will take our friend's thirty dollars, I will make it fifty
                  for him the moment he shows himself at my place of business."
               "I suppose I will have to do so," said the holder of the pocket-book, in a
                  changed, sober, and rather disappointed voice. "But it is giving up a large
                  advantage for a mere trifle."
               Eagerly Laban Lee drew forth his thirty dollars, handed it to the man, and grasped
                  the treasure.
               "Come down to No.—, South Wharves," sounded in his ears. A moment after, and he
                  stood alone, yet so bewildered that all his ideas were in a whirl of confusion.
                  Soon a calmer state followed. He crept into his cart, and there, safe from prying
                  curiosity, opened the pocket-book in order to feast his eyes upon the sum of
                  twenty thousand dollars, and to debate the question of restoration.
               Alas! From what a height of imagination down to the very bottom of the pit of
                  reality did Laban Lee soon fall. Wrapped around by three or four one-dollar
                  counterfeit bills, was a mass of soiled, crumpled, and blotted strips of bank-note
                  paper; and this was all the treasure contained in the pocket-book!
               No wonder that, in his bitter disappointment, the farmer groaned aloud. It was
                  some minutes before even a gleam of light broke in upon the darkness that
                  enveloped him. Then he thought of the man who had agreed to give fifty dollars for
                  the pocket-book. He would go to him instantly, and concealing the discovery he had
                  made, get from him the promised sum, and thus shift the loss upon another.
               Of course he did not find the individual he sought at No.—, South Wharves. He was
                  the victim, and this man an accomplice.
               Two days afterward, the post-master of Lee's village said to him—
               "Aha! So the drop-game boys have been trying their hand on you."
               "Drop game? What do you mean?" returned Lee.
               "Listen." The post-master drew a paper from his pocket and read. "'Yesterday a
                  farmer from New Jersey, named Lee, was silly enough to pay a couple of sharpers
                  thirty dollars for a pocket-book which they pretended to have found. Of course,
                  this Lee doesn't take the newspapers, or he never could have fallen into a snare
                  that has been so often exposed. We have little pity for men who are wilfully
                  ignorant."'
               Laban Lee turned off suddenly and walked hurriedly away. The next time he went to
                  the city, he ordered a newspaper.
            
            
               
               LABAN LEE'S BUTTER SPECULATION.
               WHAT HE GAINED AND LOST.
               MR. LABAN LEE, after his "Drop Game" experience, was a sadder man than before. He
                  could not get over the loss of his thirty dollars. It troubled him night and
                  day.
               "I must get it back, somehow," said the farmer to himself, at length. "I cannot
                  afford to lose so large a sum. To think that I should have been so swindled!"
               "I must get it back somehow!" It was full three weeks, from the memorable
                  pocket-book day, when the mind of Laban Lee came to this conclusion. But how was
                  he to get it back? The rogues who had swindled him were not at all likely to cross
                  his path again. There was no hope of restitution from them. But Lee had no thought
                  of this. Then how was he to get back the money he had lost?
               By cheating somebody out of it, gentle reader! That is speaking out the plain
                  truth in plain language. He was very indignant at the "drop-game" gentlemen; yet,
                  even while his indignation burned hotly, he mediated wrong to his neighbour.
               When men have the desire to do wrong, a suggestion of the means is very sure to
                  come. At the very moment when Laban Lee said—"I must get it back, somehow," he was
                  standing in his spring-house, or dairy, holding in his hand the pound weight used
                  in weighing butter for market. The round piece of iron out of which this was
                     The Butter Speculation.
                  
                   made had, originally, weighed less
                  than a pound, but been raised to the legal standard by the insertion of a piece of
                  lead, in a small indentation on the underside. This piece of lead, which weighed
                  some three ounces, was loose, thus offering a temptation for its removal. And with
                  the desire to get back his lost thirty dollars, by fair or foul means, came to the
                  mind of Lee the idea of picking out this piece of lead, and thus reducing the
                  weight of his butter so many ounces.
               No sooner thought of than done. The lead was stealthily removed, and not even his
                  better half, who conducted the weighing process, knew aught of the matter.
               Just fifty-four pounds, or, rather, "prints" of butter, had Lee in his tub when he
                  started for the city on the next market day; and yet if the whole of this butter
                  had been placed in a scale, it would not have weighed over forty-four or five
                  pounds.
               "If I come through safely," said Lee, to himself, as he rode along toward the
                  city, "I'll get back about three dollars of what I lost; and the same thing, ten
                  times repeated, will put me even with the world again. But"—
               The other view of the case was too unpleasant for contemplation, and so the
                  roguish farmer would not look at it.
               On the next morning Laban Lee took his place in the market, with his tub of fresh
                  butter—and good butter it was, as regards quality. On the top were several prints
                  of full weight; these were for the scales of the market clerk when he should make
                  his appearance, and were very ingeniously passed over by the farmer in making
                  sales.
               The price of butter was pretty well up, ranging as high as thirty-five cents. And
                  at this rate Lee had disposed of six or eight prints, when the sudden appearance
                  of the clerk of the market made his heart give a great bound, sending the
                  tell-tale blood instantly to his face.
               "All right here, of course," said the clerk pleasantly, as he looked into the face
                  of Lee.
               "The proof of the pudding is in the eating of it," returned the farmer, with
                  affected confidence, as he took a lump of butter from his tub. His eyes, however,
                  drooped beneath the clerk's gaze, as he handed it to him.
               
               The butter was placed in the scale, and proved to be good weight.
               "Try another!" said Lee.
               The clerk reached out his hand and took a second lump, while Lee replaced the
                  first in the tub. This also proved to be up to the standard.
               A third came out right also, and, but for something in the manner of Lee, who
                  could not entirely hide his uneasiness, the clerk would have passed on, satisfied
                  that all was right.
               The fourth lump was likewise full weight. Up to this point Lee had taken the
                  butter from the tub; but now the clerk of the market thrust in his own hand, and
                  lo! the scale in which he placed the print flew upward.
               "Aha, my friend! What's the meaning of this?" he exclaimed, as he transferred the
                  lump of butter to a basket, and took another from the farmer's tub.
               The unhappy farmer's whole manner underwent a sudden change, and, spite of an
                  effort at composure, every attitude and expression betrayed his guilt.
               The next print of butter proved light also; the next and the next; each in its
                  turn passing from the scale, forfeited, to the clerk's basket.
               "At your old tricks again, ha!" muttered the clerk.
               "Tricks!" exclaimed Lee, indignantly.
               But the clerk kept on transferring print after print from the tub to his basket,
                  until half the contents of the former had changed places. By this time a little
                  crowd began to gather around. Poor Laban Lee! He felt, as the saying is, as if he
                  could sink into the earth.
               "What's the matter here?" would ask one and another, as they peered, curiously, at
                  the imperturbable clerk.
               "Caught in the very act, ha!" said one.
               "Why, friend Lee!" exclaimed another, in whose familiar voice the farmer
                  recognised that of an old customer. "Who would have thought it!"
               "Yes; who would have thought it!" chimed in another customer, whose table had for
                  months smiled with the cheering presence of Laban Lee's sweet new butter.
               "My good sir," cried a waggish individual, addressing Lee in a grave voice, and
                  pointing, as he spoke, to a pair of ducks, the property of the farmer,—"as this
                  man takes so large a lot of your butter, you ought to throw in them ducks into the
                  bargain!"
               This was too much for poor Lee. With an angry exclamation he flung himself away
                  from the little furious crowd, and, retreating down the market-house for the
                  distance of three or four stalls, kept out of the way until the clerk had finished
                  his work of confiscation, which covered forty prints of butter. On his return,
                  four pound-prints only remained in his tub. Lee did not wait to sell these, but
                  hastily collecting his things together, withdrew in deep humiliation and
                  chagrin.
               The loss and gain of this butter speculation was sadly on the wrong side. There
                  was not only loss of integrity, the heaviest loss of all, but loss of money. He
                  had hoped to gain, by a sacrifice of honesty, the paltry sum of three dollars; he
                  had made the fearful sacrifice—fearful in the eternal consequences it involved—and
                  not only lost his honour, but four times the amount of money he had hoped to gain.
                  This was the loss for that day; but the consequence of his sin and folly did not
                  stop with the going down of the sun. When next market day came round, Lee could
                  not muster sufficient courage to face his customers; so he entrusted fifty pounds
                  of butter—this time full weight, and a little over—to a neighbour, not more honest
                  in heart than himself. This neighbour found the temptation of some fifteen
                  dollar's in his pocket more than belonged to him, rather too strong, and on one
                  pretence or another omitted to pay over. In fact, he had heard, while in market,
                  the story of Lee's adventure with the clerk of the market, and, as he turned it
                  over in his mind, came, in the end, to the conclusion that he would make it work
                  to his own advantage.
               Finding, after repeated efforts to get his money from this unscrupulous neighbour,
                  that he was really in danger of losing the proceeds of fifty more pounds of
                  butter, Lee said to him rather sharply—
               "Look here! I'm not going to stand this. Pay me my money at once, or I'll expose
                  you to the whole neighbourhood."
               "You will! will you?" coolly returned the other.
               
               "Yes; I will."
               "You'd better not."
               There was a threat, as well in the words as in the manner of the neighbour, that
                  communicated a sensation of uneasiness to the feelings of Lee.
               "Why had I better not? ha!"
               "Try it; and you'll find out," was retorted.
               "I will try it."
               "Very well; and if, before three hours pass over your head, the whole
                  neighbourhood is not made acquainted with a certain butter speculation of yours,
                  I'm very much mistaken. Ha! What do you say to that? So if you're wise, you'll
                  just keep your tongue between your teeth so far as I'm concerned."
               A deep crimson mantled the face of Laban Lee. He tried, for a moment or two, to
                  collect his thoughts for a reply; but finding no fit words in which to answer, he
                  turned suddenly away, and walked soberly on his path homeward.
               "Honesty is the best policy." This was the narrow, selfish, self-protecting
                  trueism that forced itself upon the thoughts of the unhappy farmer, as he moved
                  along, with his eyes cast upon the ground; and he resolved from that day to deal
                  in strict honesty with all men, as the safest and best way—best for mere temporal
                  good; the mind of Laban Lee was not then capable of appreciating any higher good.
                  But, if he continues to be honest, even from policy, we may hope that, in time, he
                  will see the true wisdom of being honest without policy. Until then, he cannot be
                  truly honest.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     The Surprise Party.
                  
               
               THE SURPRISE PARTY.
               MR. and Mrs. Atherton, and their two daughters, Helen and Alice, were sitting one
                  evening in January enjoying a new book, which one of the latter was reading aloud,
                  when a ring was heard. The reader paused, and, for a few moments, they remained
                  listening and expectant. A servant went to the door.
               "Are the ladies at home?" was heard asked, in a man's voice.
               Then a movement, as of two or three persons entering, was noticed.
               "I wonder who they are?" said Alice.
               "Some one has gone up stairs," remarked Mrs. Atherton, who had been listening.
                  "You'd better go and see who it is, Helen."
               The daughter was about rising to do as her mother had suggested, when one of the
                  parlour doors opened, and a young gentleman, dressed with great care, presented
                  himself.
               "Mr. A—! How are you this evening?—I'm very happy to see you!" said Mr. Atherton,
                  advancing to meet the young man and welcoming him cordially.
               The others greeted him in return, and he then took a seat among them.
               "I'm sure some person went up stairs," said Mrs. Atherton, speaking aside to
                  Helen.
               "True. I heard them plainly." And Helen retired from the room. As she came to the
                  foot of the stairway in the passage, she was a little surprised to find a light in
                  the room which opened from the first landing, and to perceive, through the half-opened door, the figures
                  of two or three persons moving within. She went up quickly and entered. Three
                  young girls, intimate acquaintances, were there, all tastefully dressed, and
                  displaying a profusion of ornament.
               "Why, Anna!—Jane!—Cordelia!" fell from the lips of Helen, as she grasped a hand of
                  each in succession and exchanged salutations. Then there came a pause. Helen's
                  countenance assumed a quick, thoughtful air; while her young visitors were full of
                  life, and every nerve quivering in anticipated pleasure.
               "Walk down into the parlour," said Helen. "Father, and mother, and sister are
                  there."
               As they were leaving the room, Helen's eyes rested upon a lamp that burned upon
                  the table. It was a small, fancy, gilt lamp, and had never before been seen by
                  her. She noted the fact, but her mind was too much excited at the moment to
                  reflect upon so singular a circumstance.
               The appearance of the three rather elaborately dressed young ladies, as an
                  addition to the family party below, very naturally created some surprise, and
                  disturbed the mental equilibrium of those in the parlour. But the Atherton's were
                  well-bred people, and not easily thrown off of their guard by any thing mal-apropos. The social circle widened with graceful
                  ease, and the unexpected visitors of the evening were quickly made at home.
               In about a quarter of an hour, the bell rang again, when two more elegantly
                  dressed young ladies, with a male attendant, appeared. They were also intimate
                  acquaintances, and joined the company in the parlour in that familiar, "of course"
                  kind of a way, that mystified the Athertons, who, by this time, began to fear that
                  some misunderstanding had taken place, likely to produce unpleasant and mortifying
                  results. But, as before said, they were well-bred people, and manifested no signs
                  of discomfiture or surprise.
               A third addition of this kind caused Alice and Helen to retreat to their chamber,
                  in order to give some little attention to their toilet; and Mrs. Atherton soon
                  followed their example. While this was going on, the bell continued to ring and
                  company to arrive every few moments; and, by the time they descended again to the
                  parlours, a party of between twenty and thirty were assembled there, most of them
                  particular acquaintances, and all perfectly at home. Additional lights were now
                  ordered, and things made to correspond as perfectly as possible with the suddenly
                  changed order of affairs, and with little apparent hurry and no apologies.
               A family council, composed of Mr. and Mrs. Atherton, and Helen, was now called, in
                  order to fix upon some concerted action in so strange an emergency.
               "What does it mean?" said Mrs. Atherton, in a whisper, so soon as they were
                  alone.
               "There is some mistake," remarked Mr. Atherton, gravely.
               "A very strange kind of a mistake. We've sent out no invitations to a party."
               Mr. Atherton shook his head and compressed his lips.
               "Somebody has taken a very unwarrantable liberty with us, I fear," he remarked.
                  "No doubt, all of these persons have received regular invitations to attend a
                  party at our house to-night, and are here, as they believe, at our instance."
               "Is it possible any one could do a thing like that?" said Mrs. Atherton.
               "Yes. There are persons who take a strange pleasure in annoying others with
                  practical jokes; and the greater the annoyance they can produce, the higher is
                  their gratification. To some one of our friends, who seeks enjoyment in this
                  ungenerous mode, we are no doubt indebted for the affair on our hands this
                  evening. I can only say, that I have particular reasons for regretting the mode he
                  has chosen to annoy us. But as our friends are here, innocently, we must not only
                  do our best to entertain them, but avoid the slightest intimation that they were
                  not expected."
               In this all agreed. While conversing, the bell was kept constantly ringing, and
                  party after party of guests arriving.
               "I wonder how many more are coming?" remarked Mrs. Atherton, as she listened to a
                  mingling of several voices in the
                  passage, after the street door had been again opened.
               "It will be a large party, without doubt," replied Mr. Atherton; "for when an
                  affair of this kind is gotten up, it is rarely a half-way piece of work."
               "We will have to procure refreshments," said Helen.
               "Certainly. The company are here upon our invitation, as they suppose, and we must
                  give them a suitable entertainment."
               "It is too late to provide a regular supper," suggested Mrs. Atherton.
               "Yes; that is now out of the question. We shall have to confine ourselves
                  principally to cake, wine, fruit, and confectionery."
               "And make a pretty liberal order for that, if the company continues to assemble
                  much longer at the present rate," said Mrs. Atherton.
               Her husband did not answer to the remark, but suppressed a sigh that was throwing
                  itself involuntarily from his bosom.
               "We must decide this matter soon," suggested Mrs. Atherton.
               "Yes. In half an hour or so we will be able to make some estimate of what will be
                  wanted. Then I will send round to Parkinson an order for ice-cream, cake, and
                  confectionery, &c., for a party of a given number; and to our grocer's for
                  wine and fruits."
               This and other little matters pertaining to the entertainment being settled, they
                  returned to the parlours and rejoined the company. As Mr. Atherton was entering
                  the rooms, now pretty well filled, he was still more surprised than he had yet
                  been, to hear the movement of a bow across the strings of a violin. This was
                  repeated three or four times, and then a familiar air came from the instrument,
                  and there was a movement in concert on the floor. In other words, a cotillon had
                  been formed; and when Mr. Atherton was able to take a survey of the rooms, he
                  discovered a grinning negro fiddling away in one corner, and the obedient dancers
                  threading their mazy circles in harmony with the strains he was drawing forth.
               Here was a new and not so easily explained feature in the affair. Who had ordered
                  the music? That puzzled him. But, as he dwelt upon it, light came in. It was only
                  one of the harmonious parts in the practical joke. The individual who had amused
                  himself with sending in vitations in the name of the family, had, in the name of
                  the family, ordered a fiddler. So that, after a little reflection, was
                  explained.
               Self-composed, affable and attentive, the Athertons moved amid their company with
                  an easy familiarity, so well assumed that few could have detected, even with close
                  observation, the restless surprise that lay beneath all.
               About nine o'clock, and just as they were about sending an order for refreshments,
                  two coloured men entered and bore a large basket between them through the passage
                  into the dining-room. Here they made themselves perfectly at home. The tables in
                  the room were set out, and covered with cloths which they had brought with them.
                  Upon these were arranged elegant china dishes, plates, saucers, &c., with
                  knives, forks, and spoons.
               "Well, I am confounded!" exclaimed Mrs. Atherton to her husband, as the two met in
                  one of the chambers above for further consultation. "I don't know what to make of
                  it."
               "Nor do I," returned the husband. "I confess to being entirely puzzled."
               "It is plain that a supper has been ordered by some one."
               "Yes, that is evident enough."
               "Wouldn't it be well to ask some questions of these coloured waiters who have
                  taken possession of the dining-room, without so much as saying 'by your
                  leave?"'
               "No—no," replied Mr. Atherton; "we will ask no questions; that would betray our
                  ignorance and surprise too much."
               "There is no need of our sending for refreshments."
               "None at all. Instead of considering ourselves entertainers, we may as well place
                  ourselves among the entertained, and have no further care for any thing."
               And so the Athertons acted from that time. It was in vain that efforts were made,
                  through the most careful observation, to detect the master of ceremonies in
                     this singular affair. No one
                  appeared more forward than the others; but all acted in such perfect concert, that
                  it was plain to Mr. Atherton, at length, that some general understanding existed
                  among the whole party.
               At eleven o'clock, one of the strange waiters came up to Mr. Atherton and
                  announced to him that supper was ready.
               "Very well," replied Mr. Atherton, as naturally as if he had ordered the supper
                  himself, and then gave notice to the company to pass into the dining room for
                  refreshments. A splendid entertainment had been provided, consisting of all the
                  delicacies served up on such occasions, both light and substantial, with an
                  abundance of choice wines and rare and delicious fruits.
               It can hardly be a matter of wonder, that the continued surprise of the Athertons
                  took away all appetite for the dainties set forth in such tempting profusion. They
                  were active and attentive to all during the gay repast, but partook of little
                  themselves.
               After supper, the company went back to the parlours. A few more cotillons were
                  danced, and then they all retired. At half-past twelve o'clock the Athertons were
                  alone. The waiters who brought in the supper had removed every thing, leaving
                  scarcely a trace behind them.
               "If this isn't a dream, it's the strangest waking adventure in social life that I
                  have ever heard of," said Mr. Atherton.
               "I'm puzzled entirely," added Helen. "I can't understand it at all. I never heard
                  of such a thing. Like father, I'm half inclined to think we are dreaming."
               "Who could have gotten up the affair, and carried it through so adroitly?" said
                  Mrs. Atherton. "I tried, all the evening, to detect some one a little more
                  officious than the rest, but was not able to do so."
               "It was well managed, to say the least of it," remarked Mr. Atherton; "but being a
                  practical joke, the enjoyment was all on the side of the jokers—I say jokers, for
                  it seems to me, now, that it was a concerted thing; and that all present
                  understood each other perfectly."
               "Do you think so?" exclaimed Alice, striking her hands together in sudden
                  surprise.
               "So it presents itself to me."
               "You've guessed right, without doubt," said Helen, as a light went over her face.
                  "Now I can understand a good deal that puzzled me. Well, as you say, it was
                  handsomely managed."
               "But, as I said still further, the enjoyment was all on one side. We had none of
                  it, I believe."
               "It was no pleasure to me," remarked Mrs. Atherton, seriously. "My heart was in a
                  flutter all the evening, and it required a constant struggle to keep my real
                  feelings from coming into manifestation."
               "That was my own case," added Helen. "Surprise took away all my pleasure. There
                  has been a pressure on my bosom all the evening, and I am still unable to breathe
                  freely."
               Alice tried to express what she felt on the occasion, but her lips quivered and
                  tears came into her eyes. Mr. Atherton, seeing this, remarked—
               "Ah, well, my children, let us try and forget the whole affair, or think of it
                  with as little feeling as possible. If it has given others pleasure, let us be
                  content with that."
               "I have felt a sense of humiliation all the evening," said Alice, who recovered
                  immediately her self-possession. "No one who had a proper respect for us could
                  have committed a social outrage like this—I call it by its real name."
               "It was certainly an indelicate invasion of a man's household. An intrusion within
                  the family circle that nothing can justify," replied Mr. Atherton, seriously. "And
                  Alice suggests truly, that, in the minds of the author or authors of the affair,
                  there must have been a want of proper respect for our characters and position.
                  This is self-evident. I have felt it all the evening."
               "And so have I, most keenly," remarked Mrs. Atherton. "Suppose," she added, "that
                  we had just received intelligence of the death of a near relative, or were in some
                  serious trouble? How much deeper would our affliction or trouble have been
                  felt!"
               "Or suppose," said Mr. Atherton, "I were embarrassed in business, and a creditor
                  happened to go by and discover that I was entertaining a large and gay company, would it not prejudice him against me,
                  and put me in great danger?"
               Mr. Atherton spoke feelingly.
               "It was wrong, viewed in any light," remarked Mrs. Atherton. "Wrong—wrong.
                  Pleasure is well enough in its place; but when it becomes an intruder, and boldly
                  invades the family circle, the act is nothing less than an outrage."
               Such was the state of mind produced in the family upon which had been played off
                  the practical joke of a compulsory party, for the amusement of a set of
                  thoughtless young men and women, whose knowledge of human nature was too limited
                  to teach them a decent respect for the sacred seclusion of the home circle.
               On the evening of the party, a middle-aged man was passing slowly along the street
                  in the neighbourhood of Atherton's residence. The sound of music and gay voices
                  fell upon his ears, and he paused to listen.
               "Ah, ha!" he muttered to himself, as he moved on again. "A party! Yes—yes. Well, I
                  thought he had something else to think of besides parties. And I suppose he has.
                  But—extravagant wife and daughters. Yes, that's the secret. Hum—m—m. Well, if this
                  is the game to be played, a check-mate had better come now, than when there are
                  only a few pawns on the board."
               And thus he went muttering on his way.
               On the next morning, when Mr. Atherton went to his store, he found a note on his
                  desk. It was in these words,—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR SIR:—I find, on reflection, that I cannot make the arrangement
                              about which we conversed a day or two ago.
                           
                              Yours, &c.,
                              D. ADAMS."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mr. Atherton immediately became agitated. The reason is soon explained. Two or
                  three heavy losses had crippled him in business, so far as present resources were
                  concerned, and he had applied to this Adams for aid in his extremity. Adams had
                  the fullest confidence in Mr. Atherton, and at once determined to "put him
                  through," as he expressed it. He was himself a large creditor, and had already
                  partly agreed to extend his own notes, as well as to make liberal loans. But he
                  had suddenly, and, to Mr. Atherton, unaccountably changed his mind. The promised
                  arrangement could not be made.
               Fully confiding in Adams, Mr. Atherton had sought aid in no other quarter. No
                  wonder that he was agitated when it was known that he had nothing in bank, while
                  notices for the payment of over five thousand dollars in drafts and bills, due
                  that day, were lying on his desk. It took nearly an hour for the almost paralyzed
                  mind of Mr. Atherton to come back to its usual state of vigour and activity. At
                  first, all became dark and hopeless; for he had no borrowing facilities, having in
                  the conduct of his business always preferred keeping it within his own control.
                  But his extremity was great, and it would not do to fold his hands inactivity and
                  let swift destruction fall upon him. So, after a good deal of earnest thought, he
                  went to work with some spirit, and before one o'clock was in possession of the
                  required amount of money. In obtaining it, however, he had been compelled to make
                  some heavy sacrifices. But this was overcoming only the first difficulty in a way
                  crowded with impediments; and, with each succeeding day, he found himself more and
                  more embarrassed and crippled.
               About a week subsequent to the party which we have described, a young man named
                  Bonnel, who had only a short time before commenced business, came into the store
                  of Mr. Adams, and, with much concern in his face, said—
               "Have you heard about Mr. Atherton?"
               "Nothing very particular. What's the matter?"
               "I'm told that his paper was laid over to-day."
               "Ah! I'm sorry," replied Mr. Adams, evincing much regret. "But it is what I have
                  expected."
               "It is! I never dreamed of such a thing. I thought him one of our soundest
                  men."
               "So he has been. But he's met with heavy losses of late."
               "I wish I had known that," said Bonnel, looking very grave.
               "Why. Does he owe you?"
               Yes. I sold him a pretty heavy bill week before last."
               
               "I'm sorry for that."
               "Do you think it will be a bad failure?"
               "I cannot tell. I have always had great confidence in him; but that has become
                  slightly impaired. I knew he was in difficulties, and was about helping him
                  through them, when a circumstance occurred that made me decline doing so. I felt
                  that there would be too much risk. The fact is, his family are too gay and
                  extravagant."
               "I never heard that charged upon them," said Bonnel; "and I know them
                  intimately."
               "It's no good sign," replied Adams, "for a merchant, who is crippled in his
                  business through heavy losses, to indulge in large and costly parties."
               "Atherton has not done so."
               "Beg your pardon. I happen to know that a large party was given at his house not
                  over a week since. I was about affording him all the assistance he needed; but,
                  when I saw that, I felt bound, in justice to myself, to decline an arrangement
                  that might involve me in loss."
               "And was that your only reason for refusing aid?" said Bonnel, in surprise.
               "It caused a train of reflection in my mind, that led naturally to the decision
                  formed."
               "You were unjust to him, Mr. Adams," said Bonnel, firmly.
               "Show me my error," was calmly replied.
               "Mr. Atherton did not give that party."
               "It was at his house."
               "No matter. He had no more to do with getting it up than you had. It was a
                  surprise party."
               "And, pray, what is that?"
               "Did you never hear of a surprise party?"
               "Never."
               "Indeed! They're quite the rage this winter. The particular friends of some family
                  arrange to give them, or rather compel them to give a party. They fix upon the
                  night—the family being kept in total ignorance of the fact—and go, with their own
                  music and refreshments, and take them by surprise. The greater the astonishment
                  and confusion of the family, the greater the enjoyment of those who go. I planned
                  the party at Atherton's ton's; and, I can assure you, it was a most delightful
                  affair."
               "It may have been fun to you; but, like the frogs in the fable, it was death to
                  them," said Mr. Adams, seriously.
               "How so?" asked Bonnel.
               "You placed them in a false position, and forced upon them the disadvantage of a
                  wrong judgment. On that very day, I had made up my mind to put Mr. Atherton
                  through. He had fully confided to me his difficulties, and I had resolved to help
                  him over them. But, in passing his house at night, I was surprised to find him
                  giving a large party. For a man in his position to indulge in party-giving, was
                  not the thing, in my estimation. It didn't look well. Something is wrong there,
                  said I to myself. And my final conclusion, upon which I acted, was to risk nothing
                  with him."
               "Can this be possible?" exclaimed Bonnel, exhibiting much distress.
               "It is true, as I tell you."
               "I did not dream of such a consequence. It was but a piece of innocent sport on
                  our part," said Bonnel.
               "It was a liberty," replied the merchant severely, "for which there is no excuse
                  on any ground. I can scarcely conceive of a greater social outrage than the one
                  you have indulged. Suppose intelligence had been that day received of the death of
                  a near relative; or some family trouble was oppressing the minds of all; how
                  greatly would your untimely sport have increased the pain they were suffering!
                  Knowing, as I do, the state of Mr. Atherton's mind on that occasion, I can well
                  understand how rudely jarred it must have been. But that is nothing to the
                  disastrous consequences which have followed. Ruin has been the result. An honest
                  man has been stricken down in the midst of his business career."
               As he said this, he turned partly away from Bonnel, who, feeling offended, left
                  the store.
               The struggle upon which Mr. Atherton entered, proved too much for him. Alone, he
                  could not contend successfully with his difficulties. After a day of anxious
                  effort, he found himself unable to meet the notes and drafts which fell due, and the hour of three came with his
                  obligation still in bank. Up to that time he had been in a state of deep distress
                  and agitation. But, when three strokes upon the clock sounded the knell of his
                  broken fortunes, and further effort was vain, a calmness fell upon his mind; and
                  he awaited, with a sort of stoicism, the appearance of the notary, into whose
                  hands his dishonoured paper would be given for protest. The notary came and went.
                  That ordeal, a deeply trying one, was passed. His reputation as a merchant was now
                  blasted. The apple of his eye had been touched. But he had borne the pain with a
                  heroism that surprised even himself.
               This trial past, visions of future meetings with creditors began to form
                  themselves in his mind, and his sensitive feelings were already beginning to
                  shrink painfully in anticipation, when he saw Mr. Adams enter his store.
               "I am told that your paper has laid over to-day," said the latter, as he took the
                  hand of Mr. Atherton.
               "You've heard aright. The notary left me but a little while ago."
               "For what amount have you been noted?"
               "Three thousand dollars."
               "How much more will you need to carry you through?"
               "Not less than ten thousand dollars."
               "You shall have it, Mr. Atherton. I laboured under a false impression regarding
                  you, when I declined the arrangement you wished to make a week ago. Here is the
                  money you need to-day." And he drew forth his pocket-book as he spoke. "Get your
                  paper out of the hands of the notary before he can protest it. To-morrow I will
                  see you and arrange the rest."
               On the next day, all was arranged as had been promised; and the merchant, who had
                  been on the very brink of ruin, and actually falling over, was saved.
               That was the last affair of the kind in which Bonnel ever engaged; and the last
                  inflicted on the Athertons. It had like to have proved more than a simple Surprise
                  Party to them.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     Taking Care of Number One.
                  
               
               TAKING CARE OF NUMBER ONE.
               "EVERY one for himself." This was one of Lawrence Tilghman's favourite modes of
                  expression. And it will do him no injustice to say, that he usually acted up to
                  the sentiment in his business transactions and social intercourse; though
                  guardedly, whenever a too manifest exhibition of selfishness was likely to affect
                  him in the estimation of certain parties with whom he wished to stand particularly
                  fair. In all his dealings, this maxim was alone regarded; and he was never
                  satisfied unless, in bargaining, he secured the greater advantage, a thing that
                  pretty generally occurred.
               There resided in the same town with Tilghman—a western town—a certain young lady,
                  whose father owned a large amount of property. She was his only child, and would
                  fall heir, at his death, to all his wealth. Of course this young lady had
                  attractions that were felt to be of a most weighty character by certain young men
                  in the town, who made themselves as agreeable to her as possible. Among these was
                  Lawrence Tilghman.
               "Larry," said a friend to him one day—they had been talking about the young
                  lady—"it's no use for you to play the agreeable to Helen Walcot."
               "And why not, pray?" returned Tilghman.
               "They say she's engaged."
               "To whom?"
               "To a young man in Columbus."
               "Who says so?"
               "I can't mention my authority: but it's good."
               
               "Engaged, ha! Well, I'll break that engagement, if there's any virtue in
                  trying."
               "You will?"
               "Certainly. Helen will be worth a plum when the old man her father dies; and I've
                  made up my mind to handle some of his thousands."
               "But certainly, Larry, you would not attempt to interfere with a marriage
                  contract?"
               "I don't believe any contract exists," replied the young man. "Anyhow, while a
                  lady is single, I regard her as in the market, and to be won by the boldest."
               "Still, we should have some respect for the rights of others."
               "Every one for himself in this world," replied Tilghman. "That is my motto. If you
                  don't take care of yourself, you'll be shoved to the wall in double quick time.
                  Long ago, I resolved to put some forty or fifty thousand dollars between myself
                  and the world by marriage, and you may be sure that I will not let this
                  opportunity slip for any consideration. Helen must be mine."
               Additional evidence of the fact that the young lady was under engagement of
                  marriage soon came to the ears of Tilghman. The effect was to produce a closer
                  attention on his part to Helen, who, greatly to his uneasiness, did not seem to
                  give him much encouragement, although she always treated him with politeness and
                  attention whenever he called to see her. But it was not true, as Tilghman had
                  heard, that Helen was engaged to a young man in Columbus; though it was true that
                  she was in correspondence with a gentleman there named Walker, and that their
                  acquaintance was intimate, and fast approaching a lover-like character.
               Still she was not indifferent to the former, and as he showed so strong a
                  preference for her, began gradually to feel an awakening interest. Tilghman was
                  quick to perceive this, and it greatly elated him. In the exultation of his
                  feelings, he said to himself—
               "I'll show this Columbus man that I'm worth a dozen of him. The boldest wins the
                  fair. I wouldn't give much for his engagement."
               Tilghman was a merchant, and visited the East twice every year for the purpose of
                  buying goods. In August, he crossed the mountains as usual. Some men when they
                  leave home and go among strangers, leave all the little good breeding they may
                  happen to have had behind them. Such a man was Tilghman. The moment he stepped
                  into a steamboat, stage, or railroad car, the everyone-for-himself principle by
                  which he was governed, manifested itself in all its naked deformity, and it was at
                  once concluded by all with whom he came in contact, that, let him be who he would,
                  he was no gentleman.
               On going up the river on the occasion referred to, our gentleman went on the
                  free-and-easy principle, as was usual with him when in public conveyances;
                  consulting his own inclinations and tastes alone, and running his elbows into any
                  and everybody's ribs that happened to come in his way. He was generally first at
                  the table when the bell rang; and, as he had a good appetite, managed, while
                  there, to secure a full share of the delicacies provided for the company.
               "Every one for himself," was the thought in his mind on these occasions; and his
                  actions fully agreed with his thoughts.
               On crossing the mountains in stages (this was before the railroad from Baltimore
                  to Wheeling was completed) as far as Cumberland, his greedy, selfish, and
                  sometimes downright boorish propensities annoyed his fellow-passengers, and
                  particularly a young man of quiet, refined, and gentlemanly deportment, who could
                  not, at times, help showing the disgust he felt. Because he paid his half-dollar
                  for meals at the taverns on the way, Tilghman seemed to feel himself licensed to
                  gormandize at a beastly rate. The moment he sat down to the table, he would seize
                  eagerly upon the most desirable dish near him, and appropriate at least a half, if
                  not two-thirds of what it contained, regardless utterly of his fellow-passengers.
                  Then he would call for the next most desirable dish, if he could not reach it, and
                  help himself after a like liberal fashion. In eating, he seemed more like a hungry
                  dog, in his eagerness, than a man possessing a grain of decency. When the time
                  come to part company with him, his fellow-travellers rejoiced at being rid of one whose utter
                  selfishness filled them with disgust.
               In Philadelphia and New York, where Tilghman felt that he was altogether unknown,
                  he indulged his uncivilized propensities to their full extent. At one of the
                  hotels, just before leaving New York to return to Baltimore, and there take the
                  cars for the West again, he met the young man referred to as a travelling
                  companion, and remarked the fact that he recognised and frequently observed him.
                  Under this observation, as it seemed to have something sinister in it, Tilghman
                  felt, at times, a little uneasy, and at the hotel table rather curbed his
                  greediness when this individual was present.
               Finally he left New York in the twelve o'clock boat, intending to pass on to
                  Baltimore in the night train from Philadelphia, and experienced a sense of relief
                  in getting rid of the presence of one who appeared to know him and to have taken a
                  prejudice against him. As the boat swept down the bay, Tilghman amused himself
                  first with a cigar on the forward deck, and then with a promenade on the upper
                  deck. He had already secured his dinner ticket. When the fumes of roast turkey
                  came to his eager sense, he felt "sharp set" enough to have devoured a whole
                  gobbler. This indication of the approaching meal caused him to dive down below,
                  where the servants were busy in preparing the table. Here he walked backward and
                  forward for about half-an-hour in company with a dozen others, who, like himself,
                  meant to take care of number one. Then, as the dishes of meat began to come in, he
                  thought it time to secure a good place. So, after taking careful observation, he
                  assumed a position, with folded arms, opposite a desirable dish, and awaited the
                  completion of arrangements. At length all was ready, and a waiter struck the bell.
                  Instantly, Tilghman drew forth a chair, and had the glory of being first at the
                  table. He had lifted his plate and just cried, as he turned partly around—"Here,
                  waiter! Bring me some of that roast turkey. A side-bone and a piece of the
                  breast"—when a hand was laid on his shoulder, and the clerk of the boat said, in a
                  voice of authority—
               "Farther down, sir! Farther down! We want these seats for ladies."
               Tilghman hesitated.
               "Quick! quick!" urged the clerk.
               There was a rustling behind him of ladies' dresses, and our gentleman felt that he
                  must move. In his eagerness to secure another place, he stumbled over a chair and
                  came near falling prostrate. At length he brought up at the lower end of the
                  table.
               "Waiter!" he cried, as soon as he had found a new position—"waiter, I want some of
                  that roast turkey!"
               The waiter did not hear, or was too busy with some one else to hear.
               "Waiter, I say! Here! This way!"
               So loudly and earnestly was this uttered, that the observation of every one at
                  that end of the table was attracted toward the young man. But he thought of
                  nothing but securing his provender. At length he received his turkey, when he
                  ordered certain vegetables, and then began eating greedily, while his eyes were
                  every moment glancing along the table to see what else there was to tempt his
                  palate.
               "Waiter!" he called, ere the first mouthful was fairly swallowed.
               The waiter came.
               "Have you any oyster sauce?"
               "No, sir."
               "Great cooks! Turkey without oyster sauce! Bring me a slice of ham.."
               "Bottle of ale, waiter," soon after issued from his lips.
               The ale was brought, the cork drawn, and the bottle set beside Tilghman, who in
                  his haste, poured his tumbler two-thirds full ere the contact of air had produced
                  effervescence. The consequence was that the liquor flowed suddenly over the glass,
                  and spread its creamy foam for the space of four or five inches around. Several
                  persons sitting near by had taken more interest in our young gentleman, who was
                  looking after number one, than in the dinner before them; and, when this little
                  incident occurred, could not suppress a titter.
               Hearing this, Tilghman became suddenly conscious of the ludicrous figure he made,
                  and glanced quickly from face to face.
                  The first countenance his eyes rested upon was that of the young man who had been
                  his stage companion; near him was a lady who had thrown back her vail, and whom he
                  instantly recognised as Helen Walcot! She it was who stood behind him when the
                  clerk ejected him from his chair, and she had been both an ear and eye-witness of
                  his sayings and doings since he dropped into his present place at the table. So
                  much had his conduct affected her with a sense of the ridiculous, that she could
                  not suppress the smile that curled her lips; a smile that was felt by Tilghman as
                  the death-blow to all hopes of winning her for his bride. With the subsidence of
                  these hopes went his appetite; and with that he went also—that is, from the table,
                  without so much as waiting for the dessert. On the forward deck he ensconced
                  himself until the boat reached South Amboy, and then he took good care not to push
                  his way into the ladies' car, a species of self-denial to which he was not
                  accustomed.
               Six months afterward—he did not venture to call again on Miss Walcot—Tilghman read
                  the announcement of the young lady's marriage to a Mr. Walker, and not long
                  afterward met her in company with her husband. He proved to be the travelling
                  companion who had been so disgusted with his boorish conduct when on his last trip
                  to the East.
               Our young gentleman has behaved himself rather better since when from home; and we
                  trust that some other young gentlemen who are too much in the habit of "taking
                  care of number one" when they are among strangers, will be warned by his
                  mortification, and cease to expose themselves to the ridicule of well-bred
                  people.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     The Street Smoker.
                  
               
               THE STREET SMOKER.
               "WHEW! This is terrible!"
               "I'm almost suffocated!"
               "There! That ungentlemanly fellow has puffed his vile smoke into my very
                  face.—Pah!"
               "See with what an air he moves along a step or two in advance of us. He feels his
                  importance!"
               "He's no gentleman!"
               This was said with womanly emphasis.
               "Of course not. A gentleman carefully avoids everything that is distasteful or
                  offensive to others; and, for this reason, he would no more smoke in the street
                  than he would commit any other outrage upon good manners and good breeding."
               "And this is Chestnut street! The great city promenade!"
               "There! Pah! Isn't it shocking? That overgrown, dandy negro, aping the manners of
                  his white compeers, coolly blew his vile smoke into my face."
               "Just look at that newsboy! Isn't he a man in his own estimation! With what a
                  dainty air he removes his cigar from between his lips—how leisurely the smoke
                  curls about his dirty face and uncombed head!"
               "This is Chestnut Street no longer. It is the city's great smoking saloon."
               "Bell, dear! who is that?"
               Our eyes followed the indication given by the lady to her companion.
               "Who?"—"That young man in advance of us."
               
               "The fellow who just puffed his smoke in our faces?"—"Yes."
               "I'm sure I don't know. I haven't had a good look at his face."
               "I've seen him before, or I'm greatly mistaken."
               "Where?"—"At Hetty G—'s."
               "It can't be R—?"—"I think it is."
               "He's a gentleman."—"We shall soon see."
               The two young ladies quickened their pace.
               "It's R—, as I live!" we heard, in a low exclamation.
               "Hetty shall know of this."
               "Indeed she shall. I thought I perceived the vile odour of tobacco on his clothes,
                  as he came near me, when we met him at Hetty's the other evening. It 
                     it
                     is
                   bad enough for a young man to use the nauseous weed in private; but, to
                  smoke in Chestnut street—that proves his quality! Oh, yes, Hetty shall hear of
                  this."
               "By the way," remarked the other, with a good deal of sharp sarcasm in her voice,
                  as they fell back a few paces from the smoke—"what a high manly estimation of
                  himself the individual must have, who can appear in the most frequented street in
                  the city, with a burning roll of tobacco between his lips, from which he draws
                  into his mouth a quantity of smoke, and then puffs it out into people's faces who
                  cannot but be annoyed and offended at such rude and ungentlemanly conduct."
               "The act tells the story for such individuals," was the reply.
               "We need not trace their history downwards."
               "You are right there, dear. Right there."
               We heard no more; but we had heard enough. If any thing more was wanting to
                  impress us with a deeper sense of the nuisance so feelingly spoken against, we had
                  the argument added in a choking mouthful of the vilest smoke that ever issued from
                  the mouth of a cigar-puffing vagabond
            
            
               THE TEMPERATE DRINKER.
               "COME, Harry, sign the pledge, and let rum alone!' said a young man to his friend.
                  "Do not play with edged tools, or you may cut yourself."
               "I'm not afraid," was the reply; and Harry tossed his head with an air of
                  independent confidence.
               "You ought to be,"urged his friend. "Look at old Blake, and see what a miserable
                  creature he has become? Even I can recollect when he was industrious and
                  respectable, and had his family around him. Now where are they? Two of his
                  children, the youngest, are in the poorhouse,—the rest are scattered, and his wife
                  has gone down in sorrow to her grave."
               "I am aware of all that. Why do you allude to it?"
               "Blake was once a sober man."
               "I don't know when. Even at the time when he had his family around him, and was in
                  prosperous circumstances, he drank like a fish."
               "You don't mean to say that he was born a drunkard?"
               "No, of course not. But I mean, that he has always, since he drank at all, used
                  liquor immoderately."
               "What do you mean by immoderately?"
               "Oh, as to that, freely enough to confuse his mind."
               "But I have heard my father say, that, when a young man, Mr. Blake was very
                  temperate, rarely drinking any kind of liquor."
               "That may be. But when he took to drinking, he went beyond the bounds of
                  moderation."
               "There is no doubt of that. But you don't suppose that he took to drinking
                  immoderately at once?"
               "I don't know anything about the process by which he became a drunkard. Very
                  certain I am, that if he had not made an improper use of liquor, he would never
                  have been the miserable wretch he is now."
               
               "You never said a truer word than that, Harry. But now the question comes up, what
                  is a proper use of liquor? Will you answer me that question?"
               "A proper use of it is to drink it temperately, when you feel the need of a little
                  stimulus."
               "Exactly what Blake himself would say were be now present—except that he would not
                  probably use the word temperately."
               "And yet that word makes the important difference."
               "What do you mean by temperately. Harry?"
               "I mean moderately. Or in quantities so small as not to produce intoxication."
               "How often ought this moderate portion to be taken? Oh, I recollect now,—You said
                  that it should be taken whenever the need is felt of a little stimulus. Now,
                  suppose this need is felt twice in the day, would that be too often to take a
                  little?"
               "No, of course not. I take a glass at least twice a day, and sometimes as often
                  again."
               "You do?"
               "Certainly I do."
               "The time has been, I suppose, when you didn't take more than a single glass a
                  day."
               "Yes. But it was, I believe, because I couldn't get any more."
               "At least, you drink more frequently now than you did a year ago?"
               "Yes, I believe I do."
               "How do you account for that?"
               "On the principle that I can bear more now than I could then. The habitual use of
                  an arm makes it stronger—so does the habitual drinking of liquors make the nerves
                  able to bear more powerful stimulants."
               "Are you not afraid, Harry, to practise upon such a principle? Are you not afraid
                  that the habit will grow upon you, until, before you are aware, it has obtained
                  the mastery?"
               "No, indeed! Not I! I know myself too well."
               Depend upon it, you are on dangerous ground," the friend urged. "Facts,
                  innumerable, prove, that no one becomes a drunkard suddenly—that no drunkard ever
                  intended to become a slave to the love of strong drink."
               "Perhaps so. But I have no fears. I have always been a temperate drinker, am one
                  now, and intend remaining one as long as I live."
               "Will you go to a temperance meeting with me to-night, Harry?" his friend asked,
                  after the silence of a few moments.
               "What for?"
               "A very popular lecturer is going to speak. I think he would interest you."
               "I don't see very clearly how I am to be interested in a dry temperance
                  lecture."
               "You may not find it quite so dry as you imagine. Indeed, from what I have heard
                  of this man, who is said to be one of your rough-hewn, strong, original thinkers,
                  I am pretty certain that you will not fail to be highly interested. He has,
                  himself, felt in his own person, all the horrors of drunkenness; and can,
                  therefore, and does, speak strongly and feelingly."
               "One of your reformed drunkards?"
               "Yes. Did you ever hear one of them make an address, or relate an experience?"
               "No."
               "Then come to-night by all means. It will be a treat for you."
               Henry Ellis, that was the young man's name, promised, after a little further
                  persuasion, that he would attend the meeting—though he still thought that it would
                  be an evening poorly spent. Accordingly, at the time appointed, he entered the
                  hall where the meeting was to be held, and took a seat in front of the stand.
                  After the preliminaries of the meeting were over, a short, stout, hard-featured
                  man arose to address the audience.
               "Rough-hewn, sure enough!" Ellis muttered to himself—"and no doubt original
                  enough. Well, perhaps I may hear something worth laughing at. Let us see."
               "Well, my friends," began the speaker, in an easy, familiar, off-hand style,—"You
                  want me to make a speech for you, and I suppose I must do it. It will be rough,
                  but to the point, and if I hit some of you pretty hard, you musn't get angry. I
                  never could get along by whipping the devil round the stump. It must be face to
                  face, arm's length, or not at all. I've spoken every night for the past week, in the different villages, round about,
                  upon all kinds of subjects. I've put it to the distillers hard, I tell you.
                  One-man swore that he would shoot me. But I'm not afraid. My cause is a good one,
                  and if I maintain it manfully, it will bear me on safely to the end—leaving not
                  even the smell of fire upon my garments. Next I walked into the rum-sellers like a
                  thousand of bricks, and made them flutter like hens in a barn-yard with a hawk
                  over their heads. It touches their pockets, this temperance movement, and stains
                  their respectability—so it does; and they can't bear it. They find that their
                  rum-built palaces, and money wrung from worse than widows and orphans, do not now
                  give them the standing in society that they once had. The people's eyes are
                  opened, and they see plainly; and seeing plainly, they call things by their right
                  names, and estimate by a truer standard.
               "Having, therefore, curried off and rubbed down the distiller and the rum-sellers,
                  and charged home upon them the responsibility of 'drunkard-making;' I must now
                  turn my attention to a class of the community who have quite as much to do with
                  'drunkard-making.' Who are they? you ask. I will tell you. They are the temperate
                  drinkers. Some of you look surprised—prick up your ears and become all attention.
                  It's a fact, I can tell you, and I'll make it as plain to you as that two and two
                  make four. Answer me this question. Would there be a single drunkard to-day, if
                  there had not been moderate drinkers a few years ago? No, of course not. The
                  moderate drinker is the blossom—the drunkard the fruit. Or, to give you something
                  more striking, I will use the language of a brother lecturer. The difference, say
                  he, between a temperate drinker, and a drunkard, is the same as between a pig and
                  a hog. The pig is a pretty fair beginning of a hog, and the temperate drinker a
                  pretty fair beginning of a drunkard. You can no more have a drunkard without a
                  moderate drinker, than you can have a hog without a pig. This is plain talk, my
                  friends, and some will call it extremely vulgar—especially if it hits them a
                  little hard. No doubt it is very vulgar and unrefined to say pig and hog. The
                  eating of 'them ere' animals is quite genteel; but to name them is shocking. Well,
                  perhaps it is. But we can't help it. Homely illustrations trations are generally
                  the most forcible, because their truth is less clothed, and consequently more
                  apparent.
               "Now I hope you all understand the position I take. And you all see that a weighty
                  responsibility rests upon the moderate drinker; for without his co-operation, it
                  would be impossible for all the distillers and rum-sellers in the world to make a
                  single drunkard. He may answer me, that if the responsibility does rest upon him,
                  it is a responsibility that affects none but himself. Let me beg your pardon, my
                  friend. I assume that you will become a drunkard, which is a very natural
                  inference, as you are in the only possible road leading to that wretched state.
                  Well, you have passed the point, up to which you were fully able to control
                  yourself, and are now a passive slave in the hands of the most heartless, inhuman
                  tyrant, that ever cursed the earth. You are married. The gentle maiden who won
                  your heart's first and best affections, became, years ago, your wife; and around
                  you are clustered the sweet pledges of early love. Will not these be affected by
                  your fall? Answer me that! Let me relate what I have myself seen. It is no made-up
                  story. Around it are clustered no scenes of imaginary woe. It is truth—truth
                  unadorned, but with a power to reach the heart that no mere fiction can ever
                  claim."
               The lecturer here seemed to be affected, and paused for a few moments. When he
                  again commenced speaking, it was in a changed tone, low, distinct, and full of
                  touching pathos. It was nature's eloquence—the eloquence of the heart, that now
                  fell from his tongue.
               "In giving the history which I am about to relate, I had intended to speak in the
                  third person," he said; "but the recollection of some things has so touched my
                  feelings, that I cannot go on, unless I speak of them as they were, and of myself
                  as the principal actor.
               "I was, my friends, in early years, a temperate drinker, as were most of those
                  around me. I took my glass, regularly, every day, as a matter of course, and
                  thought nothing of it. At twenty-three I became attached to a gentle, affectionate
                  girl, the daughter of a neighbouring farmer, for whom my love steadily increased,
                  until it seemed as if I would at any time have laid down my life for her This
                  earnest affection was returned. At twenty-four four I married her. An old man, considered by most
                  in the village as eccentric, because, I believe, he rigidly refused to drink any
                  kind of intoxicating liquor, met me on the next day.
               "'Good morning, Henry,' he said, extending his hand, while a benevolent smile lit
                  up his venerable face. 'Most sincerely do I congratulate you on your marriage with
                  Hetty Wilkins. I am sure you will be happy. From a child I have known and loved
                  Hetty, and that love has grown warmer every day. This interest which I feel in
                  both her and you, makes me free to whisper one warning in your ear, Henry—to
                  caution you against the only danger that it seems to me can possibly wreck your
                  happiness. May I speak freely?"
               "'To me, certainly!' I replied, wondering within myself what he could possibly
                  mean.'
               "'The only danger, then, Henry,' he said, 'lies, I believe, in your unwisely
                  indulging in the use of ardent spirits.'
               "I cannot tell you how surprised I was at this. At first, I felt half angry with
                  my aged friend; but this feeling passed away, as I thought of his
                  eccentricity.
               "You are certainly jesting with me,' I said; 'or else are under some strange
                  mistake about my habits. I do not drink to excess.'
               "'I am perfectly aware of that, Henry,' was his serious reply. 'I know that few
                  young men in this neighbourhood indulge less than you do. But the danger lies in
                  the fact of your using liquor at all. It does you no good. Cut it off, then,
                  Henry, and your happiness, and that of your young wife, are beyond the reach of
                  danger.'
               "'I have perfect control over myself,' I urged.
               "'Of that, I am assured,' he said. 'But I have heard many say the same in my time,
                  who now lie in drunkard's graves, and their children have found a home in the
                  almshouses, or in asylums for destitute orphans. Had they done as I now wish you
                  to do, all this degradation and misery would have been saved.'
               "This conversation fully determined me not to abandon the use of liquor. To have
                  done so, would have been admitting to myself and others that there was a danger of
                  my becoming that miserable being, a drunkard. The very idea was a disgrace, and I
                  rejected it with contempt.
               "Alas! alas! The fears of my friend were prophetic. In ten years from that day,
                  with five neglected children, and a heart-broken wife, I turned away from the
                  comfortless tenement that had for a few months sheltered us, houseless and
                  homeless?"
               Low, mournful and tremulous was the voice of the speaker, as he uttered these
                  words! And then followed a long, breathless pause, in which each one of his
                  hearers could hear the laboured pulsations of his own heart.
               "I can say but little more," he at length resumed. "The recollections of that
                  day—of wretched days for my wife and children, that went before, and that followed
                  after, have touched my feelings more deeply than I had expected. Thank Heaven!
                  those days are past for them and me. There is fire on our hearth, and sunshine in
                  our dwelling. Young man! Temperate drinker! Despise not the warnings of
                  experience. What has happened to me, may happen to you. You cannot now feel more
                  secure in your resolution than I did, then, in mine. I fell: so may you. Let me
                  entreat you, neither to touch, taste, nor handle the accursed thing. For the sake
                  of her, towards whom your earliest and best affections are now going out, guard
                  yourself. So shall the bright promise of your marriage hour be fulfilled!"
               The speaker then took his seat, not having spoken over one-third of the time he
                  had allotted himself. But he had said enough. The arrow had been sent with a true
                  aim, and found its right place. But few remarks were made by others; and then,
                  while an invitation hymn was sung with fine effect, the pledge was offered for
                  signatures.
               The first who presented himself, was, Henry Ellis. He sprang forward with an
                  eagerness that showed how deeply he had felt his danger, and how eager he was to
                  escape.
               Three weeks from that night he was married to one of the sweetest girls in the
                  town. While the lecturer was speaking of his early history—of his marriage—and of
                  the sad results of his temperate drinking—Ellis felt awful as imagination pictured
                  his own darkened hearth, and the
                  heart-broken maiden whom he so tenderly loved, shivering beside it.
               "Horrible!" he murmured to himself, with a shudder, as he shook off the dreary,
                  prophetic state into which he had been thrown. This fixed his resolution never
                  again to suffer anything that could intoxicate to pass his lips—and under this
                  feeling he acted when he signed the pledge so eagerly.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     The Spring Bonnet.
                  
               
               THE SPRING BONNET.
               "MY dear Carry," said Martha Grier to her young friend Caroline Mayfield—her face
                  was grave and her tones serious—"I wish you would give up this worldliness, this
                  carnal pleasure-seeking, to which you are so devoted."
               "Don't preach to me, Martha," replied Caroline, in a gay tone; "I'm quite as good
                  as you are."
               "And a great deal better, I hope," said Martha Grier.
               "But our own good is as nothing—it will not save us. 'Come out from among them,
                  and be ye separate,' are the words of solemn admonition spoken to every living
                  soul."
               "Come out from among whom?" asked Caroline.
               "From among worldlings."
               "From among the evil—so I understand the injunction."
               "Well, and what is the difference?" said Martha Grier.
               "Oh, a great deal. The evil are they who purpose and seek to do wrong; while the
                  worldlings, as you call them, are often very good kind of people—in fact, a great
                  deal better than many of your over-pious, self-righteous sort of folks, who coolly
                  consign such as I am to a place I have no fancy for, and to which I shall take
                  good care not to go."
               "You speak lightly on a serious subject, Carry."
               "Oh no!"
               "You jest with religion."
               "Beg your pardon, dear; I have never done that in my life."
               "Then I don't comprehend you," said Martha.
               
               "I am aware of that. People like you see only within the limit of a very small
                  circle. I should be sorry to give you the keys of heaven and hell."
               "Carry!"
               "Don't look so shocked, my dear."
               "Didn't you say, just now, that you never jested with religion?"
               "I did say so, and I repeat it."
               "I don't know how I am to interpret your present language."
               "Don't you? Understand it then, as only referring to those who, like yourself,
                  limit the heavenly life to a life of simple piety, and account charity as of
                  little worth; to those who separate the world and religion, instead of bringing
                  religion down into the very centre of action, and making it the heart and lungs to
                  common society."
               Martha looked surprised at this remark. There was a meaning in it that she but
                  faintly comprehended.
               "Be not conformed to the world," said she, oracularly;
               "but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds."
               "What do you mean by conforming to the world?" asked Caroline.
               "Following after its fashions, and entering into its pleasures."
               And, as Martha said this, she let her eyes wander meaningly over the
                  handsomely-dressed person of her young friend.
               "I believe you hold dancing to be sinful," said Caroline, "as well as opera and
                  play-going?"
               "I do, most assuredly," replied the young devotee.
               "And fashionable dressing?"
               "Certainly. In all this I see only conformity to the world, which is strictly
                  forbidden."
               "Is it not possible that a conformity of the spirit may be meant?" asked
                  Caroline.
               "And is an external conformity possible without an internal one?" said the
                  friend.
               "No, certainly not; but in the false maxims and evil principles which govern in
                  the world, we will be more likely to find the origin of real evil acts, than in a
                  mere fondness for dress or in a desire for innocent Pleasure."
               "Innocent pleasure! Do not the words contradict each other? 
                     
                        'Each pleasure hath its poison, too,
                        And every sweet a snare."
                     
                  
               
               "And so," returned Caroline, "has every good thing; but the poison and the snare
                  lie in its perversion from its proper use. And depend upon it, Martha, you are in
                  quite as much danger of perverting things from their true order as I am."
               "How so?"
               "True righteousness—I will speak as plainly as you have spoken to me—true
                  righteousness may be verging, in you, closely upon self-righteousness, while
                  over-piety is destroying charity."
               Martha Grier seemed half offended by this sort of plain speaking. She had, in a
                  spirit of self-righteousness, assumed to lecture her friend on the subject of
                  worldly folly and carnal-mindedness—not supposing for a moment, that there existed
                  any room for retaliation. Perceiving the effect of her words, Caroline changed the
                  subject by saying—
               "I saw some beautiful new style bonnets this morning. Have you selected one for
                  the spring yet?"
               "Yes; I ordered one yesterday."
               "Who is making it?"
               "Miss Wheeler."
               "Ah! does she make your bonnets?" said Caroline.
               "Yes; she has done the millinery of our family for the last two or three years.
                  Her mother and younger sisters are almost entirely dependent on her, and we throw
                  every thing in her way that we can. Besides, she is reasonable in her charges; and
                  we like to encourage the poor."
               "Has she good taste?" asked Caroline.
               "Oh, very good."
               "Then I will get her to make my bonnet. I saw one to-day that pleased me
                  exactly."
               "I wish you would. It is a charity to give her work."
               After leaving her young friend, Caroline Mayfield called upon Miss Wheeler and
                  gave an order for a bonnet.
               "I want it this week, remember," said Caroline.
               "I have a good deal of work on hand to be finished by Saturday night; but I will try my best to get yours
                  done."
               "Oh, it must be done," replied Caroline gayly. "I wish to show it off at church
                  next Sunday."
               The young milliner smiled at the remark of her customer, made jestingly, and said
                  that, unless some unforeseen event occurred to prevent it, she would have the
                  bonnet done.
               "Very well, I will depend on you," said Caroline, and went away.
               Saturday evening came; but no bonnet had yet been sent home for her. "I must see
                  about this," said she; "I can't be disappointed in my new spring bonnet. Have set
                  my heart on showing it off at church to-morrow." So she drew on her things; and,
                  taking her little brother with her for company, started off for the
                  milliner's.
               "Can I see Miss Wheeler?" asked she of a child who opened the door of the modest
                  dwelling where the bonnet-maker resided.
               "Yes, ma'am," replied the child; "she is in the work-room. Will you walk up?"
               Caroline tripped lightly up stairs, and pushed open the door of the work-room. The
                  only inmate was Miss Wheeler, and she sat with her face bent down on a table, and
                  two unfinished bonnets lying near. She did not move when Caroline entered, nor
                  look up, until the young lady placed her hand upon her and spoke. Then she
                  started, and turned a pale, weary face toward her visitor.
               "Oh, Miss Mayfield," said she, forcing a feeble smile to her face, "you have come
                  for your bonnet. It isn't quite done yet; but I will finish it before I go to bed,
                  and send it to you early in the morning. Both of my girls have been sick for three
                  days, and I've been up all night for two nights, trying to get through the work
                  promised. Your bonnet and Miss Grier's are the only two that remain unfinished.
                  I'm sorry you had the trouble to come out. But I won't disappoint you."
               "How long will it take you to finish these bonnets?" asked Miss Mayfield.
               "I shall have to work late; but I'll get them done."
               "How late?"
               "Till twelve o'clock—or perhaps later."
               "No, Miss Wheeler," said the young lady, firmly, yet kindly, "that must not be.
                  You shall neither overwork yourself, nor break the Sabbath by worldly labour on my
                  account. Let my bonnet lie over until next week; and I can safely speak for Martha
                  Grier that she will bear cheerfully her disappointment. Put up your work, and take
                  the rest you need."
               "My head has ached dreadfully all day, and now the pain half blinds me," said Miss
                  Wheeler.
               "Then put by your work, by all means," urged the kind-hearted young lady. "My old
                  bonnet looks very well; I wore it to church last Sunday, and can wear it again
                  to-morrow."
               "I'm afraid Miss Grier would not be pleased."
               "She's not unreasonable and cruel. I know Martha better than that. Send her word
                  how it is, and she will cheerfully bear her disappointment."
               "You are very kind," said the sick and weary young woman. "I feel as if it would
                  be wrong to tax my strength too far. Much depends on me. If I were to get sick, I
                  don't know how mother would get along."
               "Put away every thing, and go to bed at once, Miss Wheeler. If you finish my
                  bonnet and send it home, I won't wear it to-morrow. So that is settled."
               Thus urged, Miss Wheeler laid aside her work; and, with her head aching almost to
                  distraction, after sending one of her brothers to inform Miss Grier that she was
                  too sick to finish her bonnet, sought her chamber and rest for her weary limbs.
                  She had just fallen into a gentle sleep, when her brother, who had gone on the
                  errand to Miss Grier, returned, and entered her room.
               "Mary! Mary!"—cried he, placing his hand on her, and arousing her from
                  slumber—"Mary!"
               Miss Wheeler started up; but, before she had time to ask a question, the boy
                  said—
               "Miss Grier says that she must have her bonnet tonight!"
               "Did you tell her that I was sick?" inquired the sister, binding her hands across
                  her aching forehead as she spoke.
               "Yes; but she said she didn't care—she wanted her bonnet and must have it, if you worked all night to
                  get it done."
               "Oh dear!" sighed the sick, exhausted girl, as she sat up in bed, still clasping
                  her throbbing brows.
               "'She needn't think to put me off in this way,' I heard her say to her mother,"
                  added the boy.
               "Are you sure that you told her I was sick?" asked the weary girl.
               "Oh yes; I told her so twice. But she was angry, and said she didn't care—sick or
                  well, her bonnet must be done."
               "It is hard," murmured the poor girl, as she commenced slowly putting on the
                  clothes she had a little while before taken off. "Oh! how my head does ache!" she
                  added, after a few moments, pausing in her work of redressing herself, and leaning
                  her head against the wall near which she stood; "it seems as if it would
                  burst."
               The next day was the peaceful Sabbath, the season of rest from labour. The sleep
                  of Caroline Mayfield had been sweet, and in the morning she arose with tranquil
                  feelings. When church time came, she was ready to go with the family to the house
                  where God is worshipped, even though a new bonnet did not grace her head. Great
                  was her surprise, however, soon after taking her seat in church, to see her friend
                  Martha Grier wearing the new spring bonnet which she had thought lay still
                  unfinished in Miss Wheeler's work-room. As the over-pious young lady walked up the
                  aisle, it was plain, from the motion and air of her head, in what particular
                  direction her thoughts were centered.
               "What can this mean?" thought Caroline Mayfield, as she looked at the new bonnet
                  of her young friend. "Surely Martha did not compel that sick girl to work half the
                  night, in weariness and pain, that she might exhibit a new bonnet to her
                  fellow-worshippers?—Did not make her break the Sabbath, that she might keep it a
                  little more to her own satisfaction?"
               Thoughts like these kept crowding themselves into the mind of Caroline Mayfield,
                  to the exclusion of ideas more fitting for the place and occasion.
               After the services were ended, she moved, with the retiring congregation, slowly
                  from the place of worship. Just as she reached the pavement, she felt a hand upon
                  her arm. Turning, she met the half smiling, half serious face of Martha Grier. The
                  smile was natural; the serious look, the forced expression. The first came from
                  the thought of her beautiful new bonnet; the last was constrained, as fitting the
                  occasion. Meaningly, yet almost involuntarily, her eyes glanced to the head of her
                  friend.
               "So you didn't get your new bonnet," said she, in a low voice, as soon as they
                  were a little away from the crowd. "How comes that?"
               "Miss Wheeler was too unwell to finish it," replied Caroline, with a seriousness
                  that she felt and did not attempt to conceal.
               "Oh, them, you let her put you off with that excuse! But she couldn't get away
                  from her promise to me so easily."
               "Don't you regard sickness as an excuse for the non-performance of a contract?"
                  said Caroline, looking earnestly at her young friend, and speaking in a very
                  serious voice.
               "Sickness? Oh yes, sickness; but—" and she hesitated, for Caroline was gazing into
                  her face with a look that disturbed the pleasant elation of her feelings.
               "But what?" asked Caroline.
               "Miss Wheeler wasn't sick."
               "Suppose we call there on our way home from church, and see how it is with
                  her."
               "Oh no; I don't care about calling there to-day," said Martha.
               "Why not?"
               "It's Sunday, for one thing."
               "The better the day, the better the deed, you know. But, to speak seriously,
                  Martha, I think it your duty to call."
               "Why so?" asked Miss Grier.
               "In all probability, by requiring the poor, over-wearied, exhausted girl to work
                  until two or three o'clock on Sunday morning to get your new bonnet done, that you
                  might show it off in church to-day, you have made her sick in real earnest. At least, it is your duty, as a
                  professing Christian, to call and see whether this be so or not."
               Miss Mayfield felt pretty strongly on the subject, and she spoke with some
                  severity.
               "Carry, why do you talk in this way to me?" said Martha Grier, her
                  manner changing.
               "I speak only the words of truth and soberness," returned Caroline; "and these you
                  should be willing to hear. One whose piety shines forth so conspicuously as yours,
                  should see that she does not neglect her charity. Come, will you call with me on
                  Miss Wheeler?"
               "Yes, as long as you seem so earnest about it. No harm can be done. Most likely
                  you will not find her at home."
               Little more passed between the two young ladies. They were soon at the humble
                  abode of the milliner. Mrs. Wheeler, the mother of the girl they had called to
                  inquire about, opened the door for them.
               "How is your daughter?" asked Caroline.
               "She is very ill to-day," replied Mrs. Wheeler. "Won't you walk in?"
               The two young ladies entered.
               "Very ill, did you say?" remarked Caroline, as the door closed.
               "Yes, very ill, I am sorry to say. She was hurried last week, and her two girls
                  going home sick, she worked nearly all night for three nights in succession to get
                  through with her engagements. She was quite ill last night, but sat up until three
                  o'clock to finish a bonnet. I tried to get her to bed; but she wouldn't give up
                  until it was done. Then, as the last stitch was taken, she fell fainting from her
                  chair."
               "And she is very sick now?" said Caroline.
               "Yes, very sick. I sent for the doctor. He didn't say much; but I know he thinks
                  her bad. She's quite out of her head."
               "Out of her head?"
               "Yes. And she rolls about on her pillow, and talks all the time. Oh dear! I feel
                  very much troubled. Will you walk up and see her?"
               "Shall we go up, Martha?" said Caroline, looking toward her young friend.
               "Perhaps we'd better not, as she's so ill," replied Martha. "It will do her no
                  good, but may disturb her."
               "Very true. No, ma'am, we won't see her now," said Caroline, turning to Mrs.
                  Wheeler; "but I'll call around this afternoon. I hope it may not be so serious as
                  you fear."
               "You are very kind. Oh yes, I hope she may be better soon; but I'm afraid. When
                  one breaks down from being overworked, as she has been, they don't always get back
                  their strength again."
               "Your new bonnet has been purchased at too great a price!" said Miss Mayfield,
                  with some sternness of manner, as soon as she was in the street again with Martha
                  Grier. She felt strongly on the subject, and determined to give her friend the
                  full force of the reproof she deserved, even at the risk of offending her. "Wicked
                  and worldly-minded as I am, Martha, I had too much religion to do what you have
                  done. So far from requiring Miss Wheeler to over-tax her strength, in order that I
                  might have a new bonnet for Sunday, I required her to lay the unfinished work
                  aside the moment I understood she was indisposed. I not only spoke for myself, but
                  for you also—thinking that you, who served God so devotedly, could not but regard
                  with human feelings the poor, who, he hath said, are always with us. But it seems
                  that I gave you credit for more charity than you possessed. By your own
                  acknowledgment, you required her to resume the work I had, speaking for you, said
                  that she might lay aside. Pardon this freedom of speech. I say what I do, not to
                  pain you, but to make you sensible of your error. Piety and charity must go hand
                  in hand. True religion is to regard man as well as to worship God."
               The two young friends were now at a point where their ways divided. The eyes of
                  Martha were upon the pavement.
               "Good morning," said she, in a low voice, as they paused. Her face was
                  averted.
               "Good morning," returned Caroline, in a tone kinder than it was a moment
                  before.
               
               They met, a few hours afterward in the sick-room of Mary Wheeler. Martha's new
                  bonnet did not grace her head on that occasion. Indeed, she never wore it
                  afterward. She could not. The sight of it rebuked her too strongly. Happily, the
                  illness of the young milliner did not prove so disastrous as was at first feared.
                  In less than a week, she was able to be at work again, though several weeks
                  elapsed ere her health was entirely restored.
               Martha and Caroline are still friends; but the former has not again ventured to
                  read the latter a lecture on the sin of fashionable dressing, carnal-mindedness,
                  and pleasure-taking.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     Before the Election.
                  
               
               BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION.
               
                  PART I.
                  Before the Election.
                  "AH, Patrick! How are you, my friend and fellow-citizen?" said Mr. R—, to
                     Patrick Murphy, a newly created republican from the green island. "How are
                     you?" And he grasped the hand of the Irishman and shook it warmly. "How is Mrs.
                     Murphy, and all the little ones at home?"
                  "Well, I thank ye," returned Patrick familiarly. "And how's y'r honour?"
                  "First-rate, my friend,—first-rate. Won't you take something to drink,
                     Patrick?"
                  "Well, I don't care if I do," returned the willing Irishman, "if it's only for
                     the sake of the good cause."
                  "You may well say for the good cause," responded R—; "the cause of the people.
                     It is for equal rights that we are now struggling, my poor but honest friend.
                     For the right to breathe the pure air of heaven. For the right to think, and
                     speak, and act as freemen. Men in power are riding it over us rough-shod. They
                     are crushing the very life out of us. The privileged few gather to themselves
                     all the good things in the land, and leave the great multitude, the mass of the
                     people, the bone and sinew of the nation, like dogs to eat the crumbs that fall
                     from their tables. But there's a good time coming, Patrick—a good time coming.
                     A little while, and there will be a great change."
                  
                  "Yis, y'r honour, that th'r wull."
                  The candidate—for be it understood, that it was on the eve of an election, and
                     that R— was a candidate for a seat in the State legislature—now advanced toward
                     the bar—they had entered a drinking-house—saying—
                  "What will you take, Mr. Murphy?"
                  "Ony thing ye plaze."
                  "Say brandy and water?"
                  "Fust-rate," replied the Irishman, with feeling.
                  "Here's to your good health, Mr. Murphy," said R—, as he lifted his glass,
                     bowing with a graceful and well-assumed deference to his companion.
                  "The same till you," returned Murphy familiarly, as he poured half a tumbler of
                     pure brandy down his capacious throat.
                  "And now, my worthy friend," said R—, laying his hand on the shoulder of the
                     Irishman and drawing him aside, "how is the good cause progressing in your
                     particular neighbourhood?"
                  "You're safe in our ward by a hundred majority."
                  "D'ye think so?"
                  "Faith, an'ye are. I was down at McPhelin's tavern last night until twelve
                     o'clock. There warn't but three men there that dared to open their mouths for
                     L—, and I rather think their bones a'n't done aching yet."
                  "How so?"
                  Murphy doubled his huge fist, and assumed a pugilistic attitude.
                  No fighting, I hope?" said R—.
                  "No—no. Only a bit of a scrimmage. There was a rowdy Yankee there, who insulted
                     y'r honour; and the way I chastised him would have done y'r heart good."
                  "Insulted me? Ah! what did he say?"
                  "Yis; and he insulted the great body of y'r constituents into the bargain, the
                     spalpeen!"
                  "How? What did he say of me?"
                  "He said that y'r honour cared no more for a poor mon than for the dirt under
                     y'r feet; and that after the election you wouldn't let me, in particular, touch
                     you with a forty-foot pole."
                  "He said that, did he?"
                  "Indade, y'r honour, and that's jist what he did say. But if he didn't feel the
                     weight of a heavy bunch of bones, call me a liar. He'll have blue ribbons
                     around his eyes for a month. It'll be as much as the bargain if he get to the
                     polls to-morrow."
                  "And so we are certain of your ward?"
                  "Sure as death; and I take credit to meself for one-half the success. I've
                     worked hard in the good cause, Mr. R—."
                  "It's the cause of the people; or, more emphatically speaking, the cause of the
                     poor man. The rich and the privileged classes—the capitalists and monopolists
                     of the day—are crushing the very life out of you. This is the time for
                     effectual resistance. You must break the chains of oppression now, or they
                     remain fastened upon you for ever. The country of your adoption expects much of
                     you, Mr. Murphy. Do not disappoint her. Remember, that the vote of a poor man
                     is equal in value to that of the proudest nabob in the land. Never lose sight
                     of that fact, my friend. A convert to our side, no matter who or what he is, a
                     drunkard in the gutter, or a lazy pauper in the almshouse, balances off the
                     vote of one of your silk-stocking gentry on the other side. Votes are what we
                     want, then—votes—votes—votes. Let that be ever before your eyes. You'll be at
                     the public meeting to-night?"
                  "Dade, and it's what I wull."
                  "That's right. And you must bring along as many staunch adherents of the good
                     cause as you can find."
                  "Trust me for that, Mr. R—."
                  "Mr. P— is not on our side?"
                  "He? No—no! He belongs to the silk-stocking party. What d'ye think he said to
                     me yesterday? 'See here, Murphy,' says he, 'if you don't quit this drinking and
                     rowdying about, and attend better to y'r business, you and I'll have to part.'
                     Drinking and rowdying about, indade!—I knew what he meant. It was the political
                     matters he objected till. He wanted to interfare with my freedom, and compel me
                     to vote his way."
                  "Is it possible?"
                  "'Dade, and it is."
                  "What did you say to him?"
                  
                  "Say till him? Why, jist nothing at all, at all. But didn't I look as black as
                     a thunder-cloud?"
                  "Don't be afraid, my excellent friend," said the candidate, laying his hand on
                     the Irishman's shoulder, and speaking deliberately. "Do your duty as a man, and
                     fear nothing. What wages does P— give you?"
                  "A paltry twenty dollars a month, bad luck till him!"
                  For the valuable services of a man like you?"
                  "It's ivery cint."
                  "Possible! It's little better than starvation?"
                  "'Dade, and ye may well say thot. It's little more nor starvation. I wonder how
                     much better he is nor me, or ony of the poor men around him, out of whose sweat
                     and blood he is coining goold and dollars."
                  "He's not half so good, my honest friend. You're worth a dozen like him. It's
                     you that ought to be riding in a carriage, instead of one like him."
                  "The likes o' him!" contemptuously ejaculated Murphy.
                  "There's a better time coming," said the candidate encouragingly. "Work hard
                     and push through the good cause at this election. Once let our party come into
                     power, and you'll see a change that will be worth calling a change. There are
                     plenty of fat offices waiting for the working friends of the cause; and you
                     belong, emphatically to that class."
                  "Yis, indade! I'm a working man out and out."
                  "That's well known. I've heard you spoken of a dozen times. More than one of
                     our leading men have their eyes on you."
                  "We're bound to bate."
                  "But we will have to work for it. Don't forget that. Our opponents are wide
                     awake."
                  "Och! And ye needn't tell me that, Musther R—. Don't I know? But, as I said,
                     we're bound to bate; and we will bate. And when we've won the election, what
                     kind of an office do you think I can get? How large will be the salary?"
                  "Nothing less than seven or eight hundred dollars."
                  "So much as that? Och, blood-er-nouns, but won't I be illigant! Eight hundred
                     dollars! I feel rich already. Who cares for Mr. P—? Bad'cess till him!"
                  "Don't forget the meeting to-night," said R—, now moving away.
                  "Niver fear. I'll be there."
                  "And, above all, be at your post to-morrow. It is the great day of battle, and
                     unless every soldier is in the field, the enemy may conquer. Go early to the
                     polls and vote your ticket, and then see that every man over whom you have an
                     influence does the same thing. A long pull, a strong pull, and a pull
                     altogether, will do the work for us. Then, you know the motto—'To the victors
                     belong the spoils.' Good-by, my friend." And the candidate shook Murphy warmly
                     by the hand, and left him.
                  "Pah!" he muttered to himself, with disgust and impatience, as he got fairly
                     clear of the vulgar Irishman. "I shall be glad when this work is over. I'm half
                     sick with disgust, and half mad with a fretting sense of humiliation. But they
                     are our tools, and we must work with them. After our work is done, it will be
                     an easy matter to throw them aside."
                  Patrick Murphy had been in the country just long enough to secure a legal
                     naturalization, and thus get the power of a vote in our elections. As to the
                     constitution of the United States, he had never read the first article; and his
                     ideas of the spirit of our institutions were bounded on all sides by the word
                     liberty. Soon after his arrival, he became aware that duties and
                     responsibilities, undreamed of in the "ould counthry," were resting upon him.
                     He was "one of the people," upon whom reposed the welfare of the nation. There
                     was a party in power, charged with aiming to restore the old monarchical and
                     aristocratical privileges that were such a curse to Europe, and seeking to
                     trample the poor working man under foot. Pat was soon politically indoctrinated
                     by the party that first gained his ear, flattered his self-love, and excited
                     his natural belligerence; and as whisky, an article to the use of which he was
                     born, flowed as free as water at the headquarters of the party, his affections
                     were not only won, but firmly retained.
                  Pat's first electioneering experience was the one that brought him in familiar
                     intercourse as an equal with Mr. R—, than whom there was not, in feeling, a
                        more through aristocrat to be
                     found. He was one of those who really despise every thing below them; but,
                     being a lover of power and an office-seeker, he could talk of the dear people,
                     and shake them by the hand with an appearance of interest and regard, while in
                     his heart he loathed their very presence. His manner of treating Murphy
                     completely turned the Irishman's head, and made him so insolent in his manner
                     to his employer, a Mr. P—, that the latter had been several times tempted to
                     dismiss him from his store, where he was engaged as labourer and porter.
                  On the night before the election, Murphy was at the public meeting, as he had
                     promised. While R— occupied the stand as speaker, he stood close beside him,
                     hurraing and throwing his hat in the air at every emphatic sentence. Far above
                     every other voice was heard his, ever and anon shouting, "R— and the paple, for
                     ever!"
                  After the adjournment of the meeting, he met R— at the ward-house, and was hand
                     and glove with him for the space of an hour. When he started for home about one
                     o'clock in the morning, his mind had become so confused by drink or
                     self-conceit, most probably the former, that he was in serious doubt whether he
                     were not the candidate for election himself, and R— only one of the working
                     members of the political firm. Murphy had some doubts whether he would go to
                     the store at all on the next day. It was the great election day, when a battle
                     was to be fought, and when every man should be at his post and ready to do his
                     duty. After some debate, he concluded to go and open Mr. P—'s store, and put
                     the counting-room in some order, previous to the arrival of the clerks. Then he
                     would take the day to himself.
                  It was about half-past eight o'clock that Patrick Murphy presented himself to
                     the owner of the store, and, with an air of unusual self-importance, said—
                  "I shall be absent the rest of the day, Musther P—."
                  "How so, Patrick?" inquired his employer.
                  "It's 'lection day."
                  "Well, what of that? Have you a vote?"
                  "Sure and I have, as much as the best of yez."
                  "Then you're naturalized?"
                  "Dade, and I am thot."
                  "But it won't take you all day to vote. Half an hour, or an hour, at most, is
                     long enough for you to be absent from the store."
                  "I've something else to do besides voting. I'm one of the ward committee to
                     attind the polls."
                  "You are!" Mr. P— spoke in a tone of contempt that rather nettled Murphy.
                  "Yez needn't fash a body in that way, Musther P—. Ise got rights and privileges
                     as well as ony other mon, if I am poor," he answered a little indignantly.
                  "I've no wish to interfere with your rights, Patrick, said Mr. P— seriously.
                     "As a citizen, your right and duty is to vote, and time enough for that I have
                     no desire to withhold. You can go and cast your vote, and then return to your
                     work, as I shall do. But to release you from your obligation to me, that you
                     may have time to meddle in what doesn't concern you, and interfere with other
                     men's freedom in voting, is what I cannot do. Today is a busy day in the store.
                     We have a large amount of goods to pack, and cannot dispense with your
                     services."
                  "My duty to my adopted counthry"—
                  "You needn't talk to me after that fashion, Patrick," interrupted Mr. P—
                     impatiently. "Vote your vote, if you wish to do so, and leave the country to
                     take care of itself. It will get on well enough without any of your meddling
                     interference."
                  "O yis. That's the way ye nabobs try to lord it over us poor men, when ye think
                     ye have us in y'r power," retorted Murphy in an insolent tone. "But I'm not
                     jist ready to kneel down and let yez put y'r foot on my neck."
                  "My friend," said Mr. P— sharply—he was by this time quite angry—"I don't want
                     to bandy any words with you. You can go to the polls and vote. I'll give you an
                     hour for that purpose; and you can vote for his Satanic Majesty, if it please
                     your fancy, for all I care. But if you are not here at the expiration of an
                     hour, I'll hire a man in your place.'
                  "Musther P—"—
                  
                  "I will hear no more on the subject," replied the merchant, turning quickly
                     away, and walking back into his counting-room.
                  Murphy stood cogitating a few moments, and then muttering indignantly, "No
                     purse-proud nabob shall lord it over me!" walked erectly, and with a firm
                     bearing, from the store.
                  What did he care for the loss of a paltry situation like that, when in a few
                     days he would be, in all probability, a custom-house officer, enjoying an
                     income of a thousand or twelve hundred dollars.
                  All day long Patrick Murphy worked at the polls, in his ward and out of his
                     ward, at any and every thing in which those who had the superintendence of
                     affairs chose to employ him. He was an important man—in his own eyes. The
                     United States was a great country for nature's true nobility—honour and freedom
                     attended them as handmaidens.
                  The sun at last went down, and the polls were closed. Patrick Murphy would have
                     bet his life on the result. His side had won, of course; and, if the truth were
                     known, through his important aid. How deeply and heartily did he despise his
                     old employer, who had attempted to restrict his political rights, and to
                     abridge his freedom as an American citizen. There were times during the day,
                     when indignation and whisky raised his feelings to such a height that, had he
                     encountered Mr. P— in the street, he would have been strongly tempted to insult
                     and even maltreat him.
                  After ten o'clock, returns from various wards began to come in. This was the
                     exciting time. Now one party was ahead, and now the other. The poll was
                     exceedingly close. Patrick Murphy began to feel uncomfortable. Several times
                     during the evening, since the closing of the polls, he had encountered Mr. R—.
                     But, somehow or other, the candidate did not recognise him. He was too much
                     engaged with others. What did he care for the weak, vulgar tool of his ambition
                     now? Nothing! Murphy began to shrink toward his natural dimensions. In other
                     words, to feel something of his own insignificance.
                  At last the result was fully known. R— and his entire party were beaten. Murphy
                     was about sober enough to comprehend the disastrous nature of this
                     intelligence, when it came with a shock upon his unwilling ears. One more glass
                     of whisky, and he took homeward, at midnight, his disconsolate way alone, and,
                     tumbling himself into bed, was soon lost in drunken slumber.
               
               
                  
                  PART II.
                  After the Election.
                  WHEN Patrick Murphy, the independent voter, awoke on the next morning and
                     collected his thoughts, he had some strange feelings. It took him some time to
                     comprehend clearly the fact that election day had passed, and that his party
                     had been signally defeated. Alas! all the fine offices, in the distribution and
                     enjoyment of which he was to have had a share, were in the hands of the
                     victors. The beautiful visions that had floated before his imagination were all
                     melting into thin air. He was not to ride in his coach yet. Deep and heavy was
                     the sigh that accompanied this conviction, as he turned himself in bed and
                     sought in his mind for some comforting reflections.
                  "I've made some powerful acquaintances ony how," he at length said, by way of
                     consolation. "Musther R— is a jewel of a mon. Worth his weight in goold. If I
                     have lost, the siteation at Mr. P—'s, it was in his cause; and he'll not see me
                     suffer."
                  Murphy's head was none of the clearest when he arose; nor were either his
                     bodily or mental sensations the most agreeable. The amount of money in his
                     purse was just nothing at all, as he would himself have expressed the fact if
                     called upon to do so, and there were only about five dollars due him at the old
                     place he had so foolishly given up. Where the bread and potatoes for the "wife
                     and childther" were to come from was not very clear to his mind. But he strove
                     to brace himself up with the idea of having made a number of powerful
                     acquaintances, who would stand by him in his extremity as he had stood by the
                     good cause of the people.
                  
                     
                        After the Election.
                     
                  
                  
                  After breakfast, Murphy went forth and repaired to the head-quarters of the
                     party, where he found a goodly number assembled to hear the returns from the
                     county and State, and to encourage each other in their local de feat, by mutual
                     assurances of success in the general result. Most of these were men who had
                     bets pending on the State election. Those who had striven for local success, in
                     the hope of securing individual benefit when the distribution of offices came,
                     had gone back to their stores, shops, or offices, striving to be content with a
                     lot they had fondly hoped to better. Few of those around him were familiar to
                     the Irishman, and those that he did recognise took no notice of him.
                  "How are you, Musther B—?" he said, walking up to a gentleman who stood
                     conversing with a friend. The man looked at him for a moment indifferently, and
                     then merely answered in a rude, somewhat contemptuous manner—
                  "How are you, Pat?" and, turning his back toward him, went on with his
                     conversation.
                  Murphy didn't just like this. It was so different from Mr. B—'s manner of
                     speaking to him on the day before. Then it was "Mr. Murphy," or, "My dear, good
                     fellow," or, "How are you, my friend and fellow-citizen?" accompanied by a
                     cordial grip of the hand. After three or four attempts, about as successful as
                     this, to renew acquaintance with others who happened to come in his way,
                     Patrick Murphy, with his feelings rapidly declining toward zero, took his
                     departure from head-quarters, and strolled down to the ward-house—the scene of
                     his principal electioneering achievement.
                  "Hallo, Pat! How d'ye feel this morning?" was the salutation he received from a
                     lounger at the bar, as he entered. "Didn't save the nation, after all. Never
                     mind, Pat! don't look so cast down about the matter. Better luck next time.
                     You've one consolation; you did your duty."
                  "Yes, and who thanks him to-day?" laughed, or rather half-sneered another
                     independent elector, who had already found out that he was of far less
                     importance on the day after than on the day before the election. "Yesterday
                        he was one of the people, patted
                     on the shoulder and cajoled by Mr. Broad-cloth-and-calfskin; but to-day he's a
                     foolish Irishman. Ha! ha! We the people? It's very fine, and sounds first-rate;
                     but it's all sound and fury, meaning just nothing at all, at all, Pat Murphy,
                     my darlint. Come, Pat, won't you treat?"
                  Pat thrust his hand into his pocket, and then drawing it forth slowly, shook
                     his head, and sighed—
                  "Haven't a red cint left to bless meself."
                  "Just my own interesting condition, Pat.'
                  "Have you seen Musther R— the day?" asked Murphy.
                  "Yes; but he looked as sour as a lemon. It would take a power of sugar to
                     sweeten him."
                  "He's disappointed, in coorse."
                  "A'n't he?"
                  "Well, as for Musther R—, I can say wan thing of him honestly. He's a
                     jontleman, ivery inch. He knows a man when he sees him; and can appraciate
                     merit in the humblest. Bad luck till the party that bate him, say I!"
                  "He's like all the rest of 'em," replied the man to this. "Mighty fine and nice
                     when they want your vote. But too good to share the same sunshine with you
                     after the election. I know 'em all from A to Z."
                  "I'll not stand and hear a jontleman like Musther R— abused afther that
                     fashion," retorted Murphy indignantly.
                  "Won't you, indeed?" was sneeringly replied.
                  "Indade, and I won't, thin. He's my friend, and I'll hold ony mon till account
                     that spakes against him."
                  Hearing this, three or four bar-room loungers, who wanted a little excitement,
                     drew instantly around the Irishman, and began chafing him on the subject of his
                     "friend" R—. In a little while his hot blood was boiling over, and the muscles
                     of his hands contracting spasmodically. A fight ensured, in which Murphy was
                     severely beaten, and then pitched headlong into the street.
                  As the Irishman gathered himself up, and stole off like a whipped cur, he began
                     to comprehend something of the difference between before and after the
                     election—a new experience for him. Since the closing of the polls on the
                     previous evening, he had been steadily shrinking toward his former dimensions,
                     and he was pretty near down to his old size by this time. Before the election,
                     he was a man of importance in the nation. Great events depended on his
                     efficient action. Now he was simply Patrick Murphy, and he could make little
                     more out of himself. He was but a grain of sand on the sea-shore.
                  In this state of humiliation, Murphy went home at dinner-time. He dared not go
                     home before; for in that case his wife Biddy, who had a temper and a tongue of
                     her own, and who had never liked his meddling in politics, would discover that
                     had not been at work, and there would be a flare-up in consequence.
                  While meditating on his unhappy condition, Murphy, whose confidence in R— was
                     unimpaired, resolved to go and state to him that he had been turned off by Mr.
                     P— for his political opinions, and was now without the means of earning bread
                     for his family. He did not in the least doubt that R— would immediately procure
                     for him a much better place than the one he had lost.
                  Elated by this idea, Murphy left his home after dinner, and called at the
                     handsome residence of R—.
                  "Can I see Musther R—?" he asked confidently of the servant who came to the
                     door.
                  "He's engaged and cannot be seen," replied the servant.
                  He'll see me, I know. Tell him that Musther Murphy wishes to spake wid him just
                     a minute."
                  The servant hesitated to deliver the message, but Murphy urged the matter, and
                     he finally consented to do as he wished. In a few moments he returned, and said
                     that Mr. R— was engaged, and couldn't see any one.
                  "Did yez tell him me name?" asked Murphy.
                  "I did."
                  "And what did he say?"
                  "I have told you what he said," returned the servant rather sharply. "He cannot
                     see you."
                  Poor Murphy turned away, feeling still more painfully his own insignificance. A
                     few days before, he was a very lord
                     in influence; now, even a common house-servant treated him with contempt. Still
                     he had confidence in R—, the defeated candidate. R— knew him as a man, and
                     appreciated his value. He had sacrificed every thing for R—, and he was sure
                     that R— would stand by him now.
                  For an hour or two the Irishman sauntered about the streets or lounged in
                     bar-rooms, meditating on his unhappy condition. He then, in a humbled frame of
                     mind, determined to call on Mr. P—, apologize for his conduct on the day
                     before, and ask to be taken back into his employment. P— received him coolly;
                     and when Murphy volunteered an apology, told him that it was too late, as he
                     had already hired a man in his place.
                  "Then yez proscribes me for opinion's sake," said Pat, growing insolent when no
                     hope of favour remained.
                  "No," coolly answered the merchant. "I merely filled the place you left. I
                     don't care any thing about a man's opinions. I regard only his ability to serve
                     me in the situation I want filled. If he leaves my work to go and interfere
                     with the freedom of elections at the polls for a whole day, I will discharge
                     him, no matter what his political opinions may be, and I told you that
                     beforehand. So you've only yourself to blame. Here's the balance of money due
                     you. And when next you get a good place don't throw it up for the sake of some
                     brawling candidate who doesn't care three beans for you."
                  Saying this, the merchant turned from Murphy, who retired slowly, with anger,
                     mortification, and disappointment struggling in his mind for the preponderance.
                     He had only gone about a block from the store of Mr. P—, when his eyes were
                     gladdened by the sight of R—, who stood talking with two or three gentlemen.
                     Murphy waited at a respectful distance until R— was disengaged, and then
                     approached him with his hat held deferently in his hand. R— did not appear to
                     observe him, and was passing on, when the Irishman said—
                  "How are yez, Mr. R—?"
                  The defeated candidate half paused and stared at him, while his brow
                     contracted. Murphy smiled, and advanced nearer, expecting the countenance of
                     his friend suddenly to change, and his hand to seize his warmly.
                  "Who are you? And what do you want?" now fell from the lips of R—, while his
                     face wore a more repulsive aspect.
                  "Don't yez know Musther Murphy?" asked the voter.
                  "Murphy! Pah! I've had more Pat Murphy's running after me than would freight a
                     ship. What do you want?"
                  Poor Murphy was dumb with astonishment. He stood like one aghast for a few
                     moments, and then turned slowly away. He had shrunk now below his former
                     dimensions, and felt not only insignificant, but powerless and wretched. This
                     was the unkindest cut of all.
                  Since election day, Pat Murphy has had a pretty hard time to get bread for his
                     family. At hod-carrying, cellar-digging, and street-scraping, he has been
                     working off and on; and though he has lived in hopes of getting another
                     situation in a store, that hope has not yet been realized.
                  When election times come round again he will be patted on the shoulder, "called
                     one of the people," "my friend," "bone and sinew," and all that, and be hand
                     and glove with a set of men who would not pick him out of the gutter at any
                     other season. And Pat, forgetful of the lesson that he has learned, will be
                     flattered into the belief that he is "somebody," and made to pull in the traces
                     under some political driver, while of any use, and then be turned out to get
                     pasture where he can find it. How many campaigns it will take to endow him with
                     a grain of common sense or independent thought, is a sum that our knowledge of
                     figures will not enable us to cipher out. But we shall see.
               
               
                  
                  PART III.
                  Patrick Murphy Returns to his Political Friends.
                  IT was near the close of a sultry day in August, and a poor, toil-worn Irishman
                     "might have been seen" wearily wending his way upward toward the summit of a
                     house, with a hod of bricks upon his shoulder.
                  "Bad 'cess till Musther R—!" fell, half-angrily, from the Irishman's lips, as
                     he gained the elevation he was seeking, and deposited his load upon the
                     scaffold. "Bad 'cess till Musther R—!" he repeated. "If it hadn't been for him
                     I'd still be houlding my good siteation in P—'s store, instead of being kilt to
                     death wid this hod-carrying."
                  And then Mister Patrick Murphy—for it was that independent citizen—shouldered
                     his empty hod, and commenced retracing his steps down the ladder for another
                     instalment of building-materials. Just as he reached the ground, a voice, whose
                     tones were instantly recognised, said with animation—
                  "Why, Mr. Murphy, is this you? How are you, my old friend and fellow-citizen?
                     How are you?"
                  And Mr. R—, the very man Patrick had been thinking about, stood smiling, with
                     extended hand, before him.
                  To be thus addressed by a "gentleman" was more than the long-nursed anger of
                     Murphy could withstand, and it melted away into good nature, like frost-work in
                     the morning sunshine.
                  "How are yez, Musther R—?" he returned, as he left the candidate take his hand
                     and shake it heartily.
                  "Oh, bright as a May morning!" said R—, still holding
                        Returns to his Political Friends.
                     
                      ing the Irishman by the hand. "But
                     how are you getting on now, Mr. Murphy?"
                  "Bad enough, and plaze y'r honour," replied Patrick.
                  "Ah, I'm sorry for that. Have you been unfortunate?"
                  "Dade, thin, and have I. That 'lection business kilt me dead."
                  "How so, Mr. Murphy? We were beaten, it is true; but how did it affect you
                     personally?"
                  "Mr. P— turned me off for going to the polls on 'lection day, and it's been
                     hard time wid me iver since, I can tell yez."
                  "Turned you off, Mr. Murphy, for voting your sentiments as an American
                     citizen!" exclaimed R—, in well-feigned astonishment.
                  "Yis, it's just thot, Musther R—," said Murphy with much feeling. Already the
                     hope of making capital for future interest out of that circumstance was
                     beginning to form itself in his mind.
                  "Vile proscription! Thus it is that these nabobs of our land seek, as in the
                     old country, to bind the free consciences of the people, and to trample on
                     their political rights. You felt this in Ireland, Mr. Murphy; and it was to
                     escape such tyranny that you left the beautiful home of your fathers and came
                     to happy America. Shall the heel of the oppressor be on your neck here also?
                     Spirit of liberty, forbid it! Mr. Murphy, we must break down this league of the
                     rich against the poor. We can do it, and we will. In this cause I have
                     embarked, and I will die by it. What greater glory can any man desire than to
                     be known as the friend of the people?"
                  "Nabobs!" responded Patrick, indignantly taking the cue. "Yis! Vile, oppressing
                     nabobs! If I had my will o' them!"
                  And the Irishman clenched his fist.
                  "This is rather a hard kind of business, Mr. Murphy," said R—, changing the
                     subject. "A man like you ought to be doing something better than carrying
                     bricks up a ladder."
                  "Dade and he ought, Musther R—."
                  "Come round to my house to-night, Mr. Murphy. I'd like to have some talk with
                     you."
                  
                  "Yez lives in the same place?"
                  "Oh yes. Come about nine o'clock. I will be disengaged then."
                  "I'll be there to the minute, Musther R—."
                  "Very well. And now, good day. I rather think we'll find you some better work
                     to do than this."
                  All the Irishman's indignation toward R—, so long cherished, was gone. His next
                     trip up the ladder was accomplished in half the time occupied in the last
                     ascent; and when he came down again, it was "on the run."
                  Precisely at nine o'clock, dressed in his Sunday suit, which was not one of
                     particular elegance, Patrick was at Mr. R—'s beautiful residence. He rang the
                     bell, and, almost instantly, the door was opened—not by a servant, but by Mr.
                     R— himself.
                  "Ah, you're the man after all, Mr. Murphy; punctual to the minute!" said he,
                     grasping the Irishman's hand. "Come in, my good fellow. Come in," and he almost
                     dragged him into the house.
                  In a room in the third-story, to which Murphy was conducted, two or three men
                     were found sitting at a table, on which were decanters and glasses.
                  "Mr. Murphy, gentlemen."
                  Thus the Irishman was announced in a manner the most courteous.
                  "Ah, how are you, my honest friend? How are you? Happy, indeed, to see
                     you!"
                  Such was the words of welcome that greeted his appearance.
                  "Take a chair, Mr. Murphy, said R—, and he handed the Irishman to a seat, with
                     an air of deference and courtesy that was particularly flattering to the easily
                     duped son of Erin.
                  "Well, gentlemen," said R—, after they had all resumed their places at the
                     table and taken a glass round, "this is the Mr. Murphy of whom I was speaking
                     to you; an honest, hard-working man, who has been proscribed for opinion's
                     sake. No man has laboured harder or more efficiently in our cause than he, and
                     it will be a burning disgrace to our party—the party of the people, the sworn
                     advocate of the oppressed and trampled upon—if we let him suffer for his
                     devotion to true principles. This man has a family, sir—a family to whom he is
                     dearly attached, and for whom he's toiling like a galley-slave at the oar.
                     Previous to the last election, he had a good situation and a good salary in the
                     store of P—; but, because he worked in our cause, P— turned him off to starve
                     with his wife and his little ones, for all he cared!"
                  "Impossible!" exclaimed the men at the table, lifting their hands in
                     astonishment. "To think that such a spirit exists in our country!"
                  "A spirit," resumed Mr. R—, "that, if not checked, will prostrate our liberties
                     beneath the iron heel of oppression. What is a poor man in the eyes of one like
                     P—? Of less value than his horse! And he is but the type of his party."
                  To this there was a warm response from all present.
                  "And now, Mr. Murphy," resumed R—, addressing the Irishman, "the time has come
                     when another strong effort must be made to break through the party lines that
                     have been drawn by these poor-oppressing, blood-sucking aristocrats! At the
                     last campaign, we drove them back, and came near routing them, horse, foot, and
                     dragoons. This time, if we unite all our forces, victory is certain; and you
                     know, my honest friend, that to the victors belong the spoils. No man did
                     better service to the good cause at the last election than you, Mr. Murphy; and
                     now that the tug of war is about to come again, your bleeding country calls
                     upon you, and asks for aid. Shall she call in vain? No; not when her voice
                     reaches the ears of Patrick Murphy, the man who has felt the crushing weight of
                     oppression. What say you, Mr. Murphy? Are you with us again?"
                  Thus appealed to, Murphy instantly replied with enthusiasm—
                  "Faix and am I, Musther R—! Bad 'cess till the nabobs! I'll have it out wid 'em
                     yet."
                  "You've got the right kind of stuff in you, I see," remarked one of those
                     present.
                  "I'm an Irishman," said Murphy proudly.
                  "And an honour both to the country of your birth and the country of your
                     adoption," responded R—.
                  
                  By this time Murphy was fully prepared to enter into the views of the
                     individual who wanted his "valuable aid" again. Flattered into blindness, he
                     allowed the bit to be once more placed in his mouth, and bearing on the rein,
                     moved forward to the right or the left, at the will of his drivers. It was
                     demonstrated to him, with the utmost clearness, why the party failed of success
                     at the last campaign, and why it would now be sure to gain the victory. And his
                     reward was to be a clerkship in the post-office, at a salary of six hundred a
                     year. Moreover, R— said that he must throw away his hod, and come at once into
                     the service of the party. And, as the labourer was worthy of his hire, it was
                     agreed to pay him one dollar a day until the period of election arrived.
                  Again was Mr. Murphy a man of consequence in his own eyes. Higher ranged his
                     head, and more stately was his step as he walked homeward from the house of R—.
                     But he was doomed to have his ardour some-what cooled; for on announcing what
                     had just happened, to his better-half, Biddy, that lady became exceedingly
                     indignant, called him a fool, and sundry other names of like character, and
                     vowed if he got himself into any more trouble with his politics, she'd "take
                     the childther and lave him."
                  On the next morning, Murphy waited on Mr. R— again, according to appointment,
                     when arrangements were made for attending a "Harvest Home" to be celebrated at
                     a village in the county which embraced the district in which R— was a candidate
                     for election. There were to be present at this assemblage some of the leading
                     men of the party, with many of whom Murphy had worked side by side in the last
                     campaign, and he was made to believe that his appearance among them would be
                     hailed with the greatest enthusiasm.
                  "We looked upon you at the last election as one of our best men," said R—.
                     "Already more than a dozen old friends have been inquiring after you. Your
                     appearance, Mr. Murphy, will put new life into our people, for they know you of
                     old."
                  R— then placed a five-dollar bill in the hands of the Irishman, as the
                     beginning of his pay in the new service, and five more to be used for
                     electioneering purposes among his own countrymen. Particularly was he
                     instructed to see to the naturalization of all those who had been in the
                     country long enough to entitle them to citizenship, and to pay all attendant
                     expenses, if a pledge was given to vote the party ticket.
                  Again the Irishman began to feel his own importance, and to swell beyond his
                     natural dimensions. It was night before he returned home, and then he was, to
                     use a vulgar, but very expressive word, a little "groggy." The moment he
                     entered, Biddy said, with some sharpness of voice—
                  "Pathrick, ye convict! And where have ye bin all the day? Musther P— sent for
                     yez this mornin', and wants to see yez."
                  "Bad luck till Mr. P—!" returned Murphy. "Bad luck till him, I say!" and he
                     staggered into a seat.
                  "Are ye crazy, mon?" exclaimed Biddy. "No doubt Musther P— wants ye back agin
                     in his store."
                  "Bad 'cess till him! I'll niver darken his door agin, the aristocratic,
                     silk-stockin' nabob! Didn't he turn me aff for votin' me sentiments as a free
                     American citizen? Didn't he, I say? Bad 'cess till him, the spalpeen!"
                  "Y'r a drunken fool, that's what ye are!" said Biddy, in wrath uncontrollable.
                     But, knowing how fruitless a discussion would be with her husband while under
                     the influence of liquor, she curbed her anger, and had little more to say
                     during the evening. But, on the next morning, as soon as Patrick was fairly
                     awake, she began—
                  "Pathrick," said she, "are ye going till see Musther P—?"
                  "No, faix, and I am not!" replied Patrick. "I'm done wid Mr. P—, kith and kin.
                     Didn't he turn me aff for votin' my sintiments? Didn't he? Ay, fegs! And if
                     iver I darken his door, it'll do him good."
                  It was all in vain that Biddy argued, scolded, persuaded; her husband was not
                     to be moved from his resolution. There was a better chance before him than any
                     situation in P—'s store. He was to be a clerk in the post-office. That was
                     settled; and, moreover, up to the period of election, was to receive a dollar a day for
                     doing what was equivalent to "just nothing at all, at all."
                  For three or four days, Murphy spent his time idling about taverns, and at
                     night going home in a condition that made all Biddy's attempts to reach his
                     feelings abortive. Then the time for celebrating the "Harvest Home" came, and
                     he was called for in a carriage by R— and two other members of the party. Such
                     an honour elated him almost out of himself; and even Biddy, who knew that her
                     husband was no uncommon man, began to think him of even greater importance than
                     she had yet imagined.
                  The "Harvest Home," as it was called, was nothing more nor less than a
                     political gathering, for the purpose of gaining party influence. It was held in
                     a certain neighbourhood pretty thickly settled with Emerald Islanders, and the
                     particular work Murphy was wanted for on the occasion was to make interest for
                     R— among his countrymen. A bullock was to be roasted, and an entertainment,
                     consisting of an abundance of things eatable and drinkable, provided.
                  When R— arrived on the ground, accompanied by his willing tool, the latter was
                     introduced with all formality to about a dozen substantial leaders of the
                     party, office-expectants, and others personally interested in the approaching
                     election, who treated him with the most marked attention, asked him to drink
                     with them, and talked to him as if he were an individual of the first
                     importance.
                  "Welcome back among your friends" said one.
                  "Ah, my old friend Murphy," said another, "you are just the man I've been
                     wanting to see. How are you? How are you?" And he shook the irishman's hand
                     half off.
                  "Here's Mr. Murphy again!" exclaimed another. "Why, bless me! I'm as glad to
                     see you as if I'd found a guinea!"
                  And so the changes were rung, and Murphy believed that all he heard was true.
                     In return for the cordial welcome received, and the honour bestowed upon him at
                     this reunion with the party, Murphy went to work in good earnest, cheered on
                     every now and then by some one of the leaders, with flattering words of
                     encouragement like the following—
                  "You're the man, Mr. Murphy!" Or—
                  "Ah, my fine fellow! If we had a little army of such as you, we'd sweep the
                     nation!" Or—
                  "Talk to them, Murphy. That's you! The best man among us!"
                  Never did Patrick Murphy work harder at cellar-digging or hod-carrying than on
                     this occasion, in his efforts to make converts to the "cause of the people;"
                     and between arguing, persuading, drinking, quarrelling, and such other efforts
                     with his countrymen, he was so much overcome by sundown that his political
                     friends had to send him home to his wife Biddy, in a furniture wagon. As he was
                     not in a condition to feel the honour attendant on a ride with R— in his
                     carriage, such an honour was not wasted upon him.
                  On the next day, Mr. Murphy had a shocking bad headache, and was so sick and so
                     much exhausted that he kept his bed until toward night, when he sallied forth,
                     and took his way to McPhelin's tavern, where he spent the evening in drinking,
                     talking politics, and "going his death for R—," whom he did not hesitate to
                     declare, "A jontilman, ivery inch, and a raal friend o' the hardworking
                     paple!"
                  About twelve o'clock, he staggered homeward, carrying with him a black-eye and
                     sundry bruises from hard fists on other parts of his body; the effects of which
                     he did not get over for a week.
                  Thus, for a whole month, did Murphy serve the cause of the people, receiving
                     his dollar a day, besides money to use "judiciously," in treating and in other
                     ways controlling the votes of the "better class of citizens," whom he was
                     specially chosen to influence. As the election-day approached, he became busier
                     and busier, and finally was placed in charge of a "colony" of drunken vagabonds
                     who would vote either way for a glass of grog. There were twenty of these, and
                     he had them locked up in the loft of an old warehouse for two or three days,
                     supplying them with as much as they could eat and drink all the time, and generally managing to keep them too
                     drunk to run away, even if they should manage to escape from their prison.
                  The particular work of Murphy, on the election-day, was to bring to the polls
                     these vagabond voters, and as many others as he could drum up. To this end, he
                     was supplied with a carriage and ten dollars to treat with. Faithfully did he
                     perform his part, even to the injunction of R—:
                  "Mr. Murphy, mind! you must keep sober to-day."
                  "Gloriously" the voting went on from the time the polls opened until their
                     closing at six o'clock.
                  It was twelve when Patrick Murphy burst into the room where Biddy sat mending
                     the tattered jacket of her eldest hopeful, swinging his cap about his head, and
                     crying—
                  "We've bate! we've bate! Biddy, me darlint! Hurrah for R— and the cause of the
                     paple! Hurrah! Hurrah!"
                  "Hish! hish! Patrick, now! Ye'll wake the childther, and alarm the whole
                     neighbourhood!"
                  But Patrick was too intensely delighted at the great result achieved to care
                     for such trifles. Seizing Biddy in his arms, he swung her round as lightly as
                     if she had been a strip of a girl—and Biddy was not a baby in size—repeating
                     the words—
                  "We've bate! We've bate, darlint! And now for the swate little corner in the
                     post-affice, and silks and satins for Mrs. Murphy! Ha! what do yez think of
                     that, honey? Pathrick Murphy knew what he was about!"
                  But we must leave the reader to imagine the rest of this scene. The party whose
                     cause Patrick had espoused were the victors, sure enough. They had routed their
                     opponents, in the common and expressive phrase used on such occasions, "horse,
                     foot, and dragoons."
                  Next for the sequel.
               
               
                  
                  
                     
                        Abandons the Party in Disgust.
                     
                  
                  PART IV.
                  Murphy Abandons the Party in Disgust.
                  "THE victory gained, now for the spoils." If these very words were not used by
                     some hundreds of the country's "devoted friends" on the morning that followed
                     election-day, it was not because no such thought was in their hearts. As for
                     Mr. Murphy, he arose from his bed a proud man. Through his important aid—of
                     this, R— and others had assured him over and over again—the great victory had
                     been achieved; and he, of course, was sure of his reward.
                  "The fact is, Biddy, darlint," said he, as he sat over his potatoes and
                     coffee—the dollar a day had not supplied as many wants as it should have
                     done—"the fact is, I don't belave it's jist right till put me aff wid a
                     beggarly place in the post-affice, at five or six hundred a year. A man who has
                     sarved the party as I have, desarves better thratement nor that, so he
                     does."
                  "Plaze goodness!" responded Biddy, in a voice slightly troubled, "and I'd be
                     thankful for thot, and niver think o' callin' it beggarly. Yez got y'r idess a
                     little too elevated, Pathrick."
                  "Niver a bit, troth! I knows me desarvins, and I'll git them. They'll not put
                     me aff wid the crumbs o' the table, I can tell them."
                  "Have yez ony money, Pathrick?" asked Biddy.
                  "Niver a rid cint, darlint. I spent ivery farthin' yesterday in buyin' up the
                     votes; but I'll see Musther R— the mornin'."
                  "But will he pay yez ony thing more, now that 'lection is over, Pathrick?"
                  
                  "And why not, sure? Isn't he under an iverlastin' debt o' gratitude to me?
                     Didn't he say that if I'd do me duty as he knew that I could do it, he'd niver
                     forget me while the breath was in his mortal body?"
                  "But what are we to do for dinner the day, Pathrick? There isn't a loaf of
                     bread nor a petatee more in the house. The childther must have food."
                  "Och! And can't yez jist git a little thrust at Mrs. Mulligan's for the day?
                     I'll git plinty o' money when I see Musther R—."
                  "I don't know," replied Biddy. "We owe four dollars there now; and Mrs.
                     Mulligan said, the last time I was there, that I needn't come for ony more
                     thrust till the ould score was paid aff."
                  "Och! Bad 'cess till her stingy ould soul! But do you tell her, Biddy, darlint,
                     that we've bate the bloody nabobs, and that I'm to have an affice, and that
                     we're goin' to have hapes o' money, and that we'll dale with her for ivery
                     thing. Jist say all that, Biddy, and she'll open her store till yez."
                  Biddy was not so sanguine, however, and doubted the effect of this particular
                     mode of argumentation; where-upon Patrick called her an old fool, and started
                     from the table in disgust.
                  After scraping off his wiry beard, and sprucing himself up as well as he could,
                     Murphy sallied forth about nine o'clock to meet his fellow-victors, and rejoice
                     with them over the party triumph. To head-quarters he repaired, in hopes of
                     meeting R—. Dozens he found assembled there, who, like himself, had come to
                     seek for some particular leader or leaders, and who were ready to shake hands
                     with him, and exchange congratulations on the "glorious victory." But all this
                     shaking of hands amounted to nothing. It put no money in the empty pocket of
                     our friend Murphy.
                  "Have yez seen R—?" he inquired of one and another.
                  Some had seen the successful candidate and some had not. Of one individual to
                     whom his inquiry was extended, he received in reply this interrogation—
                  "R—? and pray what do you want with him? An office already, Pat Murphy!"
                  "Do yez mane to insult me?" responded Murphy angrily.
                  "Oh no!" laughed the other. "But I'd like to give you a piece of good
                     advice."
                  "Wull, and what is it?" inquired Murphy, evincing no little impatience.
                  "Why, just this, my friend:—If you've got any work to do, go and do it, and be
                     thankful."
                  "What do yez mane?" Pat's fists were clenched involuntarily. This was an insult
                     he could ill bear.
                  "I mean," was replied, "that you will find it more profitable than running
                     after an elected candidate, or seeking for an office. R— don't care three
                     buttons for you, now that he's gained the day."
                  Just at this moment, R— entered the room, and passed so close to the Irishman
                     as almost to rub against him. Pat started forward, extending his hand, and
                     saying, in a voice of exultation—
                  "Me congratulations, Musther R—!"
                  But, from some cause, R— did not hear the Irishman's voice, nor recognise his
                     person; and he was so quickly surrounded by his many "friends" that Murphy
                     could not get near him. This fact, connected with the "good advice" he had just
                     received, threw rather a damper upon the poor fellow's feelings. This state of
                     mind was not improved by the several ineffectual attempts made to obtain an
                     interview with R—, who was too much engaged with other and more congenial
                     spirits to think or care for an obscure Irishman, whom he had duped into
                     becoming an efficient tool for the accomplishment of his ends.
                  With troubled feelings, Murphy at length saw R— depart. He followed him out
                     quickly, and forcing his way up to the carriage which stood at the door, and
                     into which R— had just entered, said, in a somewhat agitated voice—
                  "Musther R—! Can I jist get a 'spakin' till yez?"
                  "To Colonel L—'s," said R— to the driver, as if he had not heard Murphy. Then,
                     waving his hand to the little crowd
                     on the pavement, and bowing and smiling, as the driver spoke to the horses, he
                     swept away, with as little thought or care for the poor Irishman as if he had
                     been one of the bricks in the pavement. Crest-fallen, and with a heavy weight
                     on his feelings, Murphy walked slowly away. Still, he was willing to believe
                     that R— had not recognised him, and that so soon as he could obtain an
                     interview, every thing would be done that he desired. He did not go home at
                     dinner-time; for he was afraid to meet Biddy with his empty pockets and no
                     prospects of filling them ahead. And as he had not, to use his own words, "a
                     rid cint to bless himself wid," he was compelled to go without food until his
                     return in the evening.
                  In going from place to place, familiar during the progress of the canvass, and
                     in meeting certain individuals with whom he had been hand and glove for weeks,
                     he found that he was a man of far less consequence than before. Instead of
                     cordial greetings and fine compliments, a cold "How are you, Murphy?" "Still
                     loafing about, Pat?" or some such address, met him at every turn. Occasionally,
                     an individual about as important as himself would seize his hand and half wring
                     it off. But he would have willingly dispensed with these particular
                     congratulatory manifestations.
                  About three o'clock, Murphy repaired to the residence of R—, and sent his name
                     in by the servant, who brought back word that the gentleman was particularly
                     engaged.
                  "Tell him," said the Irishman, "that Mr. Murphy would jist like to spake wan
                     word wid him. Jist wan word and no more—and won't kape him a minute."
                  The servant went back, and, after a rather prolonged absence, returned and
                     asked Murphy to walk in.
                  "Take a seat. Mr. R— will be down in a little while," said the servant, as he
                     opened one of the parlour doors and motioned the Irishman to enter.
                  A quarter of an hour elapsed, and then R— made his appearance. His face did not
                     wear a very cordial aspect. It is true, there was a smile upon his lips, but it
                     was a forced smile, fading quickly.
                  "Well, my good friend," said he coldly, "what can I do for you?"
                  He did not even say "Mr. Murphy."
                  The Irishman was chilled by the manner of R—, and felt himself strongly
                     repulsed.
                  "I've worked hard for yez," said Pathrick, in a humble voice.
                  "You did your duty to the good cause; I'll give you credit for that, friend
                     Murphy; and you'll get your reward."
                  "But how soon, Musther R—?"
                  "All in good time—all in good time," was answered, with some impatience.
                  "Ye knows, Musther R—, that I gave up my siteation"—
                  "At hod-carrying? Oh yes, I remember. Well, Pat, you've had a pretty easy time
                     of it for a couple of months, and can go to work now with more spirit,
                     sustained as you will be by the reflection that you have served your adopted
                     country like a good and true citizen."
                  "But I gave up my siteation, Musther R—," said the Irishman, in a distressed
                     tone of voice.
                  "You must find another, then, my friend. You can't expect to live in idleness.
                     Every man must work to live."
                  This was said in a tone of stinging rebuke.
                  "I'm not afraid to work," returned Murphy. "But I've got no work. You promised
                     me"—
                  "Office-hunting already! Why, don't you know, man, that I shall not take my
                     seat in Congress for a year? I'm still only a private citizen."
                  "A year!" stammered Murphy in a husky voice. "A year, did yez say?"
                  "Certainly I did. The member's term, in whose place I have been elected,
                     doesn't expire until the close of the present Congress. When I take my seat
                     next fall, I will do all I can for you. But, until that time, you must go to
                     work like an honest, industrious citizen. Your reward will come; never
                     fear."
                  Murphy had arisen from his chair when R— entered the room, and was still standing on the floor,
                     the member elect not having invited him to resume his seat.
                  "And now," said the latter, "you must excuse me. I have several friends in
                     waiting."
                  And he bowed in a way that said "Be off!" almost as distinctly as if he had
                     given utterance to the words.
                  Confounded and utterly cast down under a sense of mortification and distress,
                     the Irishman turned away and retired in silence.
                  "Remember, William," he heard R— say to his waiter, as he was passing to the
                     door, speaking with some anger,
                  "I'm not at home to any of these fellows."
                  Outside of the door, as he opened it, Murphy found two men of his own class,
                     one of whom said—
                  "Can I see Mr. R—?"
                  "He is not at home," said the servant, appearing at the moment.
                  "When will he be in?" was inquired.
                  "I can't tell," was answered, and the door was shut in the man's face.
                  "It's a bloody lie!" said Murphy indignantly, half to himself and half
                     aloud.
                  "He is in, then?" exclaimed one of the men.
                  "He's jist that!"
                  "Have you seen him?"
                  "Yis."
                  "Well?"
                  "And got a bit of cowld comfort for me pains; jist what ye'll git, if ye'r
                     after ony favours."
                  And, with this he turned away, in no very pleasant mood of mind. As he was
                     walking along, with his head bowed down and his eyes upon the pavement, some
                     one said—
                  "Hi, Patrick! is this you?"
                  On looking up he recognised one of the clerks in Mr. P—'s store.
                  "Where have you been keeping yourself, Patrick? We spent a whole week some time
                     ago in trying to find you."
                  "Indade!"
                  "Yes. The man we got in your place turned out badly. We changed two or three
                     times, and then Mr. P— thought he'd give you another trial, if you were
                     inclined to make a change. He'd seen you at work carrying bricks and mortar,
                     and said he couldn't help pitying you."
                  "I'm obleeged till him for his kindness," repled Murphy, at once elated in
                     prospect of a return to his old place. "Mr. P— is a jontilman, I must say; and
                     I was a fool iver to have left his employ. I'll go back wid pleasure."
                  "Ah, but, Patrick," replied the young man, in a tone of regret, "it is too late
                     now. We couldn't find you, and so filled the place with another man, who is all
                     that we could want."
                  "It's all bad luck!" exclaimed the Irishman, in a voice of distress. "I've a
                     mind to go and 'thrown meself."
                  "But where were you, Pathrick? We left word at your house for you to come round
                     to the store."
                  "Where was I, d'ye say? Faix, and I was mindin' other paple's business instid
                     o' me ane."
                  "Indeed!"
                  "Yis. I was promotin' the election of R—, bad 'cess till him!"
                  "Ho! ho!" laughed the young man, in spite of the sadness of the Irishman's
                     face. "Well, you are a fool! What good did you expect to gain from
                     his election."
                  "He promised me a siteation in the post-affice?"
                  "Did he? That's rich! What has he to do with the post-office?"
                  "I do' no'. But he promised that I should be rewarded."
                  "As he promised two or three hundred besides, as big fools as you are. He'll
                     have nothing to do with the post-office. In fact, he won't take his seat in
                     Congress for over a year; and then his influence, if he have any, will not go
                     in your favour. He's got too many others to reward with the few crumbs it may
                     be in his power to dispense."
                  The Irishman groaned, but made no reply.
                  "Good-morning, Patrick," said the clerk. "And take with you this piece of good
                     advice: never put any faith in the
                     promises of a politician, made on the eve of an election, for he'll be sure to
                     deceive you."
                  With this, the young man moved on, and the Irishman was left still sadder than
                     before.
                  Of the toil and struggle through which the humbled Patrick Murphy, again shrunk
                     down to his real dimensions, passed during the long, hard winter that followed,
                     and of the sufferings endured by his poorly clothed, warmed, and fed, wife and
                     children, we will not speak. They were severe enough. In the spring he went
                     back to cellar-digging and hod-carrying, at which he worked until fall, when he
                     was sought for again by his old political friends, who knew the value of his
                     services, and was again wheedled by promises into taking the bit into his
                     mouth. This time, however, he was a little wiser, and took care not to neglect
                     his daily work. In the spring, a new party, triumphant at this election, were
                     to come into power, and Murphy, a little better instructed than before, now
                     understood that he must wait a few months before the time came for a
                     distribution of political favours in the shape of comfortable offices; so he
                     wisely accepted, for the winter, the place of coal-heaver in a coal-yard.
                  March at length came around, and a new party came into power. Then followed a
                     general system of removals from office, and the appointment of new men.
                     Murphy's time had at length come. There was a broad gleam of daylight ahead of
                     him, and his heart beat high again with anticipation. He was an applicant for
                     office, and pressed in among the crowd, eager as any to secure the reward of
                     party service. At first, his ambition led him to select the post of inspector
                     of the customs; then he changed from that to a clerk in the post-office; and
                     afterward to a letter-carrier. But as he could get no one to sign him a
                     recommendation to either of these places, he, upon the advice of one for whose
                     opinion he had some respect, filed an application for the situation of night
                     inspector, or, in other words, custom-house watchman. The running, coaxing,
                     begging, and all manner of humiliation attendant on getting up his
                     recommendations, were painful to even Murphy's rather obtuse sensibilities, and
                     he more than once felt like giving up the effort in disgust, and falling back,
                     for life, upon honest, independent labour. As the signature of R—, the party
                     member to Congress, was considered of importance, Murphy strove hard to get it.
                     R—, with whom, after various trials, he at length obtained an interview,
                     promised him all his influence to secure him the place he wanted, and said that
                     he would make it his business to see the collector in his behalf that very day.
                     (He had made the same promise to about sixty or seventy different
                     office-seekers.) Murphy asked his signature to his recommendation; but this R—
                     declined giving, on the ground that he was called on every hour for such
                     certificates, and that he could not sign all, and, therefore, signed none. It
                     was in vain that Murphy urged his valuable aid in securing R—'s election; the
                     member could not be brought to sign the paper, and the Irishman went away with
                     some righteous indignation in his heart.
                  Still, for all this, through singular good fortune, Murphy got the appointment
                     he sought, and felt that he was "a made man." In his elation, he was stimulated
                     by certain individuals that were instantly attracted around him, to give his
                     "friends" a regular "blow out." So he invited them to a supper at McPhelin's
                     tavern, a place for which he had a particular regard.
                  Some twenty choice spirits responded to this invitation, and not only ate and
                     drank the oysters and brandy he had provided, but ordered champagne and sherry
                     by the dozen; and, in conclusion, broke up about two o'clock in the morning by
                     breaking all the furniture in the room.
                  Sober and serious was Patrick Murphy on the next morning—Patrick Murphy, newly
                     appointed night inspector to the custom-house, with a salary of five hundred a
                     year. On that day he was to enter upon the duties of his office; or, rather on
                     the evening following that day. Touching the doings of the night before he did
                     not feel very comfortable. McPhelin's bill for the supper would, he was afraid,
                     be larger than he intended to make it; and then the breakage of furniture might
                     give him trouble.
                  All was quiet for about a week, during which time Murphy discharged his duties
                     as an officer faithfully, and kept
                     away from McPhelin's. But the evil in search of us is sure to find us out.
                     McPhelin's bill came at last, and proved to Murphy worse than all his fears. It
                     stood thus— 
                        
                           For supper and wines.
                           $40
                        
                        
                           For breakage of furniture.
                           30
                        
                        
                           
                           $70
                        
                     
                  
                  Poor Murphy, already in debt some eighty or ninety dollars, besides two
                     quarters' back rent, the result of his electioneering diversions, was
                     confounded by such an unexpected bill. But there was no evading it. He had
                     ordered the supper, and under his sanction the wines had been added. Moreover,
                     the party introduced by him had broken the landlord's furniture, for which he
                     very confidently demanded payment.
                  A day or two after the receipt of this document, the Irishman sat alone in one
                     of the offices attached to the custom-house, meditating on what he had gained
                     and lost by politics, and feeling in no very elevated frame of mind, when the
                     messenger came in and handed him a letter. He broke the seal and read, with
                     dismay, his dismissal from office, ample testimony having been received at the
                     "Department," so said the communication, "that he was a drunken turbulent
                     fellow, and not to be trusted by the government, which sought for sober,
                     orderly men to fill its responsible stations."
                  This was too much for Patrick Murphy to bear patiently. Here was the result,
                     after between two and three years' devotion of himself to party interests. Thus
                     was he rewarded! A pleasant morsel placed before his eager lips, and then drawn
                     hastily away! In the excitement and indignation of the moment, he tore his
                     dismissal from office into a hundred pieces; and then, seizing a chair, as his
                     frenzy increased, dashed to fragments a plaster bust of the chief magistrate of
                     the nation that stood the only witness to his disgrace.
                  "Murphy, my good fellow, how are you?" exclaimed an old party leader and
                     driver, who had obtained good service out of the Irishman in former times. This
                     was at the opening of the next political canvass.
                  Murphy, when thus addressed, was standing in front of P—'s store, back into
                     which snug quarters he had found his way again.
                  "Purty well, I thank yez," returned the Irishman coldly.
                  "How are you getting along now?" said the other, not seeming to notice the
                     indifference with which he was received.
                  "Fust-rate," answered Patrick laconically.
                  "Glad to hear it. No man deserves good fortune if you do not. Well, you see,
                     election time is coming round again."
                  "Indade."
                  "A time when every good citizen is expected to do his duty."
                  "I did my duty wanst, and what"—
                  "That you did, Mr. Murphy, as hundreds can testify," interrupted the other.
                  "Humph! I know thot as wull as ony body."
                  "We want to see you down at head-quarters to-night," said the man, now laying
                     his hand familiarly on Murphy's shoulder. "We can't do without your valuable
                     aid."
                  "Be dad, and yez won't see me there!" returned Patrick, showing his teeth and
                     knitting his great shaggy brows.
                  "Why not, my honest friend?" inquired the party leader.
                  "Don't honest frind me, if ye plaze! I'se abandoned yez all in disgust, so I
                     have, bad cess till y'r politics! They're only got up to chate and desave the
                     honest, hardworkin' paple into votin' for nabobs, who don't care a ha'pence for
                     them."
                  "But, my friend Murphy," began the other, in a soothing voice.
                  "Yez nadent frind me," quickly retorted the Irishman.
                  "It'll do no good. A burnt child dreads the fire. I'se got enough of politics.
                     So good mornin' till yez."
                  And with this the "disgusted" elector turned away and marched into the store.
                     The man, half-amused and half-angry,
                     stood for a moment looking in after Murphy, and then moved on, saying to
                     himself as he did so—
                  "Confound the fellow! He isn't so green as I thought him. Well, we must fill
                     his place with some Green Islander of a later importation. There are plenty of
                     them about ready to be caught. I guess we can spare him."
                  And with this consolation, the party leader went on his way. Doubtless he found
                     it an easy matter to fill the gap left by Murphy's breach from the traces; for,
                     we say it more in sorrow than in levity, "all the fools are not dead yet."
               
            
            
               
               
                  
                     The Love Letter.
                  
               
               THE LOVE-LETTER.
               ANDY CAVENDER was a sad trifler in his way. There was scarcely a maiden in the
                  village to whom he had not made love at one time or another, and all as a pleasant
                  piece of pastime; not seeming to understand that maiden's hearts were tender
                  things, and liable to be hurt in the handling.
               Many tears had he caused to flow from beautiful eyes, yet, if he knew of the fact,
                  it did not appear to give him serious concern. There was always a smile on his lip
                  and a light word on his tongue.
               At last, however, Andy's heart received an impression. The image of a fair young
                  girl rested upon it; not as of old, like the image in a speculum, to pass with the
                  object, but like the sun-fixed image of the Daguerreotype. Strange fact! the
                  fickle, light-hearted Andy Cavender in love; really and truly in love.
               There had come to Woodland, to pass a few months during the warm summer-time, a
                  city maiden, whose charms were too potent for the village flirt. She came, he saw,
                  and was conquered. It was soon plain to every one that it was all over with Andy
                  Cavender. Kate—the lively, witty, darling Kate Archer had subdued him with her
                  charms, though all unconscious herself of the conquest she had made.
               But others saw what she perceived not, and looked on curious for the issue.
               "What do you think of this, Jenny?" said Kate Archer, one day, to the young friend
                  with whom she was spending her summer
                  in the country, and she laughed as she spoke, at the same time holding up a
                  letter.
               "News from home?" remarked Jenny, smiling.
               "Oh dear, no! It's a love-letter."
               "What!"
               "A real righty love-letter, and, as they say, nothing else. Oh dear! To think that
                  I should have made a conquest already!"
               "A love-letter, Kate? Well, here is an adventure, sure enough! Whose heart have
                  you broken?"
               "You shall see and hear for yourself," replied the laughing girl. Then, as she
                  unfolded the letter, she put on a grave countenance, and, opening the pages to the
                  eyes of her friend, read aloud—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MY DEAR MISS ARCHER:—Will you permit one who, from the moment he saw
                              you, became an ardent admirer, to lay his heart at your feet? Until
                              you appeared in our quiet village, no maiden had passed before me who
                              had power to win my love. But, from the moment I saw you, I no longer
                              had control over my affections. They flew to you like a bird to its
                              mate. You cannot but have observed, in all our recent meetings, that I
                              regarded you with more than a common interest, and I have permitted
                              myself to believe that you read the language of my eyes, and
                              understood its meaning. You did not turn from me; you did not look
                              coldly on me. Have I erred in believing that your heart responded to
                              the warm emotions of my own? I trust not. If it be so, then am I of
                              all men most miserable. I will wait, with trembling and impatient
                              hope, your answer to this.
                           
                              "Tenderly and faithfully yours,
                              "ANDREW CAVENDER."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Now, Jenny, dear, what do you think of that?" said Kate, gayly, as she folded up
                  her letter. "Haven't I made a real conquest?"
               "Andy Cavender! Well, that beats every thing!"
               "None of your country maidens for him," laughed Kate. "He must have a city
                  belle."
               "Country maidens! He's made love to every good-looking girl within ten miles
                  round."
               "He!"
               "Yes. There's no counting the hearts he has broken."
               "Did he ever make love to you?"
               "Oh, certainly," replied Jenny, gayly.
               "In real earnest?"
               "Ah! now you come to the point. Perhaps you've not heard that Andy is our village
                  flirt?"
               "A flirt, indeed! And so I am to be one of his victims. Oh dear!"
               "I don't know as to that. I more than half suspect him to be in earnest now. In
                  fact, I've heard from more than one source, that he is desperately in love with
                  you."
               "Will he hang himself if I'm inexorable?"
               "There's no telling. But what kind of an answer are you going to make to his
                  avowal of love?"
               "What shall I say?"
               "Oh, that depends on your feelings."
               "He's a regular flirt you say?"
               "I could name you a dozen girls at least, to whom his attentions have been of a
                  character to make them believe that his designs were serious. Two or three were
                  made very unhappy when he turned from them, like a gay insect, to seek another
                  flower."
               "Then he must be punished," said Kate, resolutely; "and be mine the task to lay
                  the smarting lash upon his shoulders. For the man who deliberately trifles with a
                  woman's feelings I have no pity. He has been the cause of pain beyond what it is
                  possible for himself to feel; and, if I can reach his sensibilities in any way,
                  you may be sure that I will do it with a hearty good-will."
               "I do not like the thought of giving pain," remarked Jenny, "even to a
                  reptile."
               "Pain is salutary in most cases; and will be particularly so in this, I hope. He
                  will have some idea of how it feels, as the woman said, when she rapped her boy
                  over the head with a stick for striking his sister."
               It was as Jenny supposed, and as we intimated in the beginning; Andy Cavender was
                  really and truly over head and ears in love with Kate Archer, and every line of his amatory epistle was from his
                  heart. Two or three letters were written and destroyed before he produced one
                  exactly to his mind, and this he finally despatched in full confidence that, as it
                  came from his heart, it must reach the heart of the lovely maiden.
               Two days went by, and no answer was received by the enamoured swain. He began to
                  feel anxious. On the third day, a neat little perfumed envelop came into his
                  hands, which on opening, he found to contain a pink, perfumed, satin-edged sheet
                  of note-paper, on which were a few lines most delicately written. They were as
                  follows:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MY DEAR SIR:—Your letter, containing a most flattering avowal of
                              regard for one who is comparatively a stranger, has been received. Its
                              effect I will not attempt to describe; nor will I, at this time,
                              venture to put in written language what I feel. To-morrow evening I
                              will spend at Mrs. T—'s. May I hope to see you there?
                           
                              "Yours, &c.,
                              KATE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Andy was in ecstacies at this answer to his epistle. Its meaning to him was as
                  plain as if Kate had said,
               "Dear Andrew, my heart is yours."
               On the next evening, he repaired to Mrs. T—'s, trembling with fond anticipation.
                  On entering the parlour he found but a single person therein, and that a young
                  lady named Herbert, to whom he had formerly paid very marked attentions. Aware
                  that she had been made unhappy by his fickleness, not to call it by a harsher
                  name, the meeting rather threw a damper over his feelings. But Andy had his share
                  of coolness and self-possession, and although it cost him a considerable effort,
                  he managed to introduce topics of conversation and to talk pretty freely, although
                  the talking was nearly all on his own side, Miss Herbert maintaining a cold
                  reserve, and answering entirely in monosyllables.
               For about a quarter of an hour, Andy endured the ordeal, wondering why this
                  particular young lady should happen to be alone in the parlour of Mrs. T—, and
                  wondering still more why Miss Archer did not make her appearance. Just as he began
                  to feel a little excited and uneasy, the door opened, and in walked another young
                  maiden whom he had reason to remember—a Miss Mary Harper. She was also one of his
                  old flames. She appeared surprised at seeing him, and greeted him with coldness.
                  Andy tried to say some sprightly things to Miss Harper; but he was far from being
                  in as good condition as at first. The effort to entertain Miss Herbert had
                  somewhat exhausted his reservoir of spirits, and his attempts to draw further
                  thereon were not very successful. The two young ladies drew together on the sofa,
                  and maintained a mutual reserve toward Andy that soon began to be painfully
                  embarrassing.
               "What does all this mean?" Andy had just asked himself, for he was beginning to
                  feel puzzled, when the sound of light feet along the passage was again heard, and,
                  the door opening, his eyes rested upon the form of Caroline Gray, to whom he had
                  once paid his addresses. Very particular reasons had Andy Cavender for not wishing
                  to meet Caroline on that particular occasion; for he had committed himself to her
                  more directly than to any other young lady in Woodland, having, on one occasion,
                  actually written and sent to her a love-letter. The precise contents of that
                  epistle he did not remember; but often, when he thought of it, he had doubts as to
                  the extent to which he had committed himself therein, that were not very
                  comfortable.
               Soon another and another entered, and, strange to say, each was an old flame,
                  until there were present not less than six fair, rebuking spirits. Silent, Andy
                  sat in the midst of these—silent, because the pressure on his feelings had become
                  insufferably great—for nearly a quarter of an hour. It was a social party of a
                  most novel character, and one that he has never forgotten.
               About the time that Andy's feelings were in as uncomfortable a state as could well
                  be imagined, and he was beginning to wish himself at the North Pole, Kate Archer
                  and her friend Jenny entered the room slowly, the former with an open letter in
                  her hand, upon which the eyes of both were resting.
               In an instant, it flashed upon Andy Cavender that he was to be victimised by the city belle. No sooner
                  had this thought crossed his mind than, rising abruptly, he bowed to his fair
                  tormentors, saying—
               "Excuse me, ladies." And beat a hasty retreat.
               But ere he had passed beyond the street door, there reached him a gush of merry
                  laughter from the musical throat of Kate, in which other voices mingled.
               On the next day, he received a letter directed in a delicate hand. It inclosed the
                  one he had written to Kate, and accompanying it was a note in these words—
               "There is, it is presumed, a mistake in the direction of this. It was probably
                  meant for Caroline Gray, Mary Harper, Nancy Herbert, or Jenny Green. In order that
                  it may receive its proper destination, it is returned to the writer."
               The village flirt was a changed man after that. He had played with edged tools
                  until he cut himself, and the wound, in healing, left an ugly scar. Poor Andy
                  Cavender! All this happened years ago, and he is a bachelor still, notwithstanding
                  several subsequent attempts to make a favourable impression on the hearts of
                  certain pretty maidens. The story of his punishment at Mrs. T—'s flew over the
                  village in a few hours, and after that no fair denizen of Woodland for a moment
                  thought of regarding any attention from Andy Cavender as more than a piece of idle
                  pastime; and, on the few occasions that he ventured to talk of love, the merry
                  witches laughed him in the face.
            
            
               THE HASTY MARRIAGE.
               IN the select circle of refinement and intelligence in which she moved, none were
                  more highly esteemed than Jane Power. She was beautiful without affectation or
                  pride, amiable without weakness, and well educated without being pedantic. If she
                  had any fault, it was, that she had too warm and too confiding a heart. Innocent
                  and sincere herself, she never suspected others of guile or duplicity. She had,
                  indeed, heard of wicked men and women, but could not imagine that any she met,
                  with graceful manners, and smiling countenances, could be such. There was an
                  excellent but not brilliant young man, named Jason, who was sincerely attached to
                  her, and for whom she had begun to entertain sentiments rather warmer than those
                  of common friendship. But just as a sincere esteem was beginning to ripen into
                  pure affection, another actor of more imposing exterior came upon the scene. His
                  name was Fells. Nothing was known of him in the circle, where he appeared as a
                  perfect stranger, and received all the attention and courtesy due to a stranger
                  who comes introduced by respectable individuals.
               Here is a grand and fatal error in our social habits and regulations. Let me
                  illustrate it in the present instance. Who then was Mr. Fells? The son of a
                  respectable merchant in Charleston, who had been ruined by his vices and
                  extravagance. At his father's death, he inherited the small remnant of a broken
                  fortune, and made his way North, with evil habits confirmed, and principles shaken
                  to the foundation. He had two prominent vices, drinking and gaming, with others
                  not to be mentioned here. These soon made deep inroads upon his slender means,
                  and, as a necessary resource, he entered a hardware store in this city, as a
                  clerk, at a salary of five hundred dollars a year With this, and partial habits of
                  forced economy, he was enabled to keep
                  up a very fair appearance. Having a good education, and being well acquainted with
                  business, from having early in life entered his father's counting-room, he soon,
                  by hiding carefully his evil propensities, gained the confidence of his employers,
                  who at the end of the second year, proposed a limited partnership. He was thus
                  enabled to take that position in society which he desired. He was handsome,
                  intelligent, of pleasing address, and in business—of course he could
                  get into almost any society, for there are too few social restrictions founded
                  upon principle.
               Parents too generally allow their daughters to choose their own company, and to
                  visit where they please. And those who make parties rarely inquire into the moral
                  character of the stranger they are asked by an acquaintance to invite. I need not
                  say that this is all wrong. The many unhappy marriages that take place in the very
                  best families, in our city, every year, painfully attest this fact. This evening,
                  a father may look with proud affection upon his beautiful and accomplished
                  daughter, as she glides smiling from his presence to grace an evening party, and
                  to-morrow, unknown to him, her young and confiding heart may tremble with a
                  pleased agitation as it treasures up the looks, the words, and smiles, of one who
                  has neither character nor principle. A few weeks pass, and the mischief is done.
                  Perhaps the young man calls in company with a friend of the family, about this
                  time, and spends an evening. The father and mother, culpably unsuspicious, receive
                  their visiters with smiles and compliments, and in a half hour "leave the young
                  people alone." Is it any wonder that in this way attachments are formed which a
                  whole lifetime of wrong and misery cannot break? It is in vain, when matters begin
                  to wear a more serious aspect, for the father to discover that a young man
                  addressing his daughter is not what he could wish. Her heart is now all too deeply
                  interested in the matter. His business was to have guarded the tender blossom,
                  which God had given him, from the contact of evil. It is too late now. The "poison
                  of love" has passed through every vein, and there is but one physician that can
                  allay the burning fever. If he does not consent to yield up, even with tears, his
                  dear child to the arms of one who will soon esteem her as of little worth, he
                  will, in all probability, find her deserting her home and long cherished ones for
                  the protection of a stranger. Do not these things happen around us every day?
                  Depend upon it, our social barriers are far too easily passed! There is not enough
                  exclusiveness practised towards the unknown and the unprincipled.
               But I must return. Consequent upon the facility with which a young man of pleasing
                  manners and good appearance can get introduced into society, Fells soon gained a
                  pretty extensive acquaintance. He had frequently met Miss Power "in company," but
                  had not yet obtained "an introduction," that cobweb protection against the
                  advances of a perfect stranger. He was acquainted with Jason, her almost constant
                  attendant, and, finding that no offer was tendered of an introduction, told him
                  one day that he should like to visit Miss Power. Jason, who was of a quiet,
                  observing turn of mind, had seen many things in the conduct of Fells which he did
                  not like, and had determined from the first, that through him Jane Power should
                  never make the acquaintance. He evaded a direct reply, by observing that she was a
                  very worthy and intelligent young lady, and immediately changed the subject. But
                  Fells was not to be driven off.
               "She is certainly a sweet little creature, and I must know her," said he to
                  Jason.
               "She is amiable and good," was the reply.
               "By the by, Jason, people say that her father has the gooseberries."
               "The what?"
               "The gooseberries, man! Why, you're green! The ready rhino, to the tune of sixty
                  thousand."
               "I presume her father is in easy circumstances. But what of that?"
               "What of that, Jason? Why, do you suppose I am so simple, or that I think you so
                  simple as to care nothing for the wherewithal? No, indeed! I consider myself worth
                  at least twenty thousand dollars, and I must have a wife on equal terms."
               "How long is it since you were worth twenty thousand dollars, Mr. Fells?"
               
               "Why, am I not a genteel, well-educated man—and is not every such a man valued low
                  at twenty thousand dollars?"
               "You're jesting."
               "Indeed I am not jesting, though. And a wife of equal worth I must have."
               "I don't exactly understand your mode of reasoning."
               "Well, I suppose I must explain then. Any man of business capacity, can earn, as a
                  clerk, at least one thousand dollars a year, which is the annual interest on a
                  permanent capital of twenty thousand dollars. A woman can earn nothing, therefore
                  she should have a capital of twenty thousand to invest, to be on equal terms with
                  her husband. Do you understand that?"
               "Perfectly."
               "And mean, of course, to practise on so plain a principle."
               "I leave all theories and practice of this kind to you, Mr. Fells."
               "Of course," said Mr. Fells, with a sneer. And the subject was changed.
               More than ever determined was Jason now, to keep, if possible, so dangerous and
                  heartless a man from becoming acquainted with Miss Power. But there are so many
                  ways to gain an introduction into our social circles, that Fells very soon was
                  charming the ear of the unsuspicious girl, and winning her good opinion to
                  himself. Jason observed this with pain, but did not feel at liberty, under all the
                  circumstances, to whisper to Miss Power the danger she was in. A stronger motive
                  for standing aloof, was founded in pride. If such a one as Fells could win the
                  affections of Miss Power, she was unworthy his regard. So soon as this thought
                  flashed across his mind, he withdrew himself almost entirely from her company, and
                  left her free to feel the witchery in every word and tone of the specious and
                  fascinating stranger.
               Fells now became a frequent visiter at her father's house, and her constant
                  attendant. Partner in the respectable firm of Gains, Fells & Co., he was
                  received by the thrifty father of Miss Power with smiles of approbation tion, and
                  sooner than he could have expected, he was the accepted lover of the sweetest girl
                  he had ever met.
               A believer in the old adage, that a "bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,"
                  Fells proposed an early day for the marriage, and in a very brief space was the
                  husband of Miss Power.
               Little change could be seen in Fells for two or three years, by any one, except
                  his poor wife, who too early discovered that she had given a treasure into the
                  keeping of one who could form no appreciation of its value,—that the fascinating
                  glitter of his manners but the more effectually concealed the roughness, and
                  coldness, and want of principle within. Her simple mind was at first shocked by
                  the small regard he evinced for truth, and the want of feeling often shown towards
                  the suffering. But he was not harsh to her, only cold, and often indifferent. How
                  her poor heart sometimes ached, when it turned back upon itself, after vainly
                  seeking from him some word, some look, some tone of pure and deep affection!
               Not long after their marriage, the fingers of Fells began to itch to handle some
                  of the many dollars Mr. Power was reputed to possess. As a limited partner in his
                  present firm, money accumulated with him too slowly, and he longed to pass
                  thousands to the account of profit, where he now passed hundreds.
               Before the end of the first year, he so won upon the confidence of his
                  father-in-law, as to induce him to offer an equal partnership in his own house,
                  which was doing a heavy business in the jobbing line. He of course at once
                  dissolved existing connections, and entered upon a business of which he knew
                  nothing. In a short time, Mr. Power, as Fells was an active man, and of good
                  address insisted that he should take the position of principal salesman. In this
                  capacity he was eminently successful, for he could sell more goods, by one-half,
                  than the oldest and most experienced salesman in the house. Young western and
                  southern merchants, who were fond of frolicking and good company, soon got to know
                  the house of Power and Fells, and were sure to go there, in the fall and spring,
                  to buy their goods. And why? because the junior partner always attended them in
                  their wine drinking, and other parties of pleasure. He always had a free ticket
                     for them at the theatre, and could
                  go with them to every place of amusement and dissipation to which their loose
                  morals might lead them.*
                  
               
               Securing almost the entire custom of the pleasure-loving western and southern
                  merchants, he of necessity often made bad sales, and at the end of the second
                  year, the house, instead of showing any real profit, was considerably injured by
                  the failure of customers. In making up a statement, and ascertaining exactly the
                  position of affairs, Mr. Power's eyes were suddenly opened to the real state of
                  the case. His mercantile sagacity should have taught him as much before, but it
                  required a heavy loss to open his eyes. He now remembered, with pain, that Mr.
                  Fells kept too constantly the company of just such men as those who had cheated
                  the house. A suspicion, on the instant flashing across his mind, caused him to
                  turn to his son-in-law's account, when he was alarmed to find, that, although he
                  was living with his wife at his house, at no expense but what it took for
                  clothing, he had actually drawn four thousand dollars in a twelve-month! Deeply
                  pained at this discovery, and remembering all at once that Fells had not been
                  regular in his attendance at the store, and that he generally kept very late hours
                  at night, rarely coming in before one, two, and three, in the morning, he had a
                  sickening consciousness that something was vitally wrong—something threatening to
                  destroy his peace of mind, and that of his daughter, for ever.
               Many painful reflections crowding upon his mind, he felt unfitted for business,
                  and retired to his home at an early hour. Seeing now with opened eyes, he was
                  shocked to perceive the wan, pale countenance of his daughter, and the look of
                  anxious concern which she directed towards him, as he came in at an unusual
                  hour.
               
                  
                  *I must not be understood as attempting to insinuate anything against the
                     morals of western and southern merchants, as a body. Among them, as among
                     all classes of the community, are those who are fond of dissipation, when
                     they come to the large eastern cities, where an open door invites them in
                     almost every street. It is well known, that this disposition to seek
                     pleasure, falsely so called, by some of the younger country merchants, is
                     encouraged by a few eastern houses, some members of which are always at hand
                     to introduce them into all the mysteries of city vice and dissipation.
               
               "What is the matter, father?" said his child, whose heart had long feared, with an
                  excited and trembling fear, some strange calamity.
               "Nothing, daughter."
               "But something must be the matter, father, for you look pale, and strangely
                  concerned; and you are not used to come home at this time."
               "I do not feel altogether well, this afternoon, child, and that has brought me
                  home."
               Jane looked at him for some moments doubtingly, and then turned away with a
                  deep-drawn sigh, to attend to a bright little fellow about two years old, who just
                  at that moment came running to her with some childish request.
               That night was one of sleepless anxiety, and deep thought to Mr. Power. He had no
                  counsellor, but his own breast; for one who had ever been a faithful adviser, and
                  an unfailing stay when he would have fallen under the pressure of calamity, had
                  been laid in her grave for more than a year. After weighing matters calmly, and
                  solemnly, for many hours, he came to the resolution, of expostulating first, and
                  then proposing a dissolution of partnership, if his reasonable desires were not
                  complied with. It was near day when Mr. Fells came in, and he was not up, of
                  course, at the regular breakfast hour. Mr. Power thought he had never seen his
                  daughter's countenance look so haggard and care-worn as it did while she sat alone
                  with him that morning at the breakfast table.
               It was nearly ten o'clock, when his son-in-law came to the store, and immediately
                  Mr. Power requested an interview with him in the private apartment of the
                  counting-room. Here he stated to him his fears for the ultimate result of his
                  present course of conduct, and his entire disapprobation of it.
               At first, Fells was disposed to take matters in anger but when his father-in-law
                  told him, with an air of stern determination, such as he had never known him to
                  assume, that, unless he complied with his wishes, an immediate dissolution must
                  take place, he appeared humbled, and promised amendment.
               For a short time his course of conduct was apparently all that could be desired.
                  And the cheek and eye of his poor wife were brighter, and her tone happier, than
                     they had been for months. They had
                  two sweet children, one a boy over two years old, and the other a girl who had
                  only numbered a few months. In these he seemed to take a new delight. But alas!
                  all this was of but short duration. He had commenced the downward course, and who
                  could arrest him in his career to ruin?
               At the end of three months, he was as irregular in his habits as ever; but Mr.
                  Power allowed none of the responsibilities of the business to rest upon him, and
                  kept a careful eye upon his drafts for money. By this means he restrained him in a
                  great measure from running into excesses.
               But he had become the slave to two o'ermastering vices—drinking and gaming!—and
                  for the last, no trifling supplies of money would answer. Mr. Power watched with
                  too jealous an eye, over the cash account, to allow him to make further
                  unnecessary inroads there, and the limited supply he could draw, was in every way
                  insufficient to meet his debts of honour (!!) But money he did raise, and how?
                  Why, he made a note of five thousand dollars in the name of the firm, at four
                  months, obtained an endorser, and opened with it a new account in a bank that
                  readily discounted it. This amount did not last him long, as he had gotten of late
                  more deeply entangled in the gambler's difficulties, having fallen in with some of
                  those soulless gentry called blacklegs. The whole five thousand were gone in a
                  month. He now waited upon a firm that was in the habit of exchanging notes with
                  them, and stated that they wanted an accommodation of ten thousand dollars, and
                  wished to pass obligations. A note for the amount was obtained, and as readily
                  passed through bank. Intoxicated with so abundant a supply of money, he risked it
                  prodigally at the gaming table, and soon found that he was turning his last dollar
                  again. A momentary pang of remorse shot through his mind as he reflected upon the
                  result of all this—but, resolved still to have money, he sat down to devise new
                  schemes for procuring it.
               He had formed an acquaintance with a villain who had no conscience, and to him he
                  confided a statement of his dilemma. They put their heads together, and after
                  suggesting many things, at last resolved, that Fells should make ten notes, each
                  for two thousand dollars, in the name of Power and Fells, and that he should pass
                  them away to several note-shavers. The plan was executed, and as the credit of the
                  firm was among the first in the city, the notes were caught up with avidity by the
                  private money-lenders, who rarely got hold of anything in those times so
                  "strong."
               He had now drawn upon the firm to the amount of thirty-five thousand dollars, and
                  from his knowledge of the amount of real capital employed, he knew well that a
                  suspension would be the consequence. But he cared but little now. Secure in the
                  last dividend he would probably get of the profits, real or imaginary, of the
                  business, he cared to remain no longer, and accordingly started off secretly for
                  the south, under an assumed name, leaving his wife and children without a word,
                  and with scarcely a thought—and old Mr. Power to bear soon the shock of a falling
                  house.
               All that poor Mrs. Fells suffered when she found that her idolized husband was
                  gradually growing indifferent to her—that even the smiles of their sweet babes
                  could not win him to his home—is only written in heaven. My imagination cannot
                  picture it, nor my pen describe it. All the period of three years, from the time
                  she was married, until her husband went away, I will pass over, though it was to
                  her a period of intense mental suffering, and bring her before the reader on the
                  night of her watching, until the stars grew dim—"and yet he came not."
               After tea on that evening, she sat with her babe in her arms, until nearly ten
                  o'clock, musing sadly upon the strange conduct of her husband. At eleven, she
                  threw herself upon the bed, as was her wont, without taking off her clothes, and
                  slept until two, when she awoke as usual, to listen and wait for her husband. The
                  night was dark and cloudy, and as it was late in autumn, the wind moaned drearily
                  along the deserted street, giving a sadder feeling to her already overburdened
                  heart. How anxiously did she listen to the sound of every footstep as it
                  approached, and with what cheerless disappointment did she notice its passing by!
                  There o'clock, and yet he had not come.—The minutes fled away, and filled up
                     the measure of another hour, and
                  still she sat, listening, at the window. And when the dim light of the morning
                  came coldly in, and paled the flickering rays of the taper, she was still a
                  sleepless watcher. Who can calculate the extent, who can fathom the depths of a
                  woman's ever-during affection?
               Agitation and alarm were visible in her countenance when Mr. Power came down from
                  his room in the morning.
               "What is the matter, Jane?"
               "Mr. Fells has not been at home all night. Where can he be?"
               "I am sure I cannot tell, Jane. But don't be alarmed; he will be here, I suppose,
                  this morning. He does not keep as regular hours as he should."
               "Oh, father, my heart feels as if it would break! I have watched for him all night
                  long, in hope and fear, and yet he is away! he never comes home now until three or
                  four o'clock, and then often so much intoxicated, that he will curse and abuse me
                  if I say a word to him." And the poor wife covered her face with her hands, and
                  wept until the tears trickled through her thin white fingers, and fell in large
                  drops upon the floor.
               Her father folded her in his arms, and endeavoured, silently, to calm the
                  excitement of her feelings. Many thoughts rushed through his mind, and bitterly
                  then did he repent his early carelessness in leaving his daughter an easy prey to
                  any plausible villain who might chance to come along. He felt then and there the
                  necessity of social restrictions, but felt it too late.
               The hours rolled heavily away for Jane Fells that day, for each recurring one she
                  hoped would bring back her absent husband. At two o'clock, when Mr. Power came
                  home to dinner, he had not been to the store; and now, in considerable alarm, her
                  father went out to seek him, he knew not whither. After vainly searching and
                  inquiring in all directions, he was informed by a friend that he saw him take his
                  seat in the western stage at six o'clock that morning in company with a noted
                  gambler. With this information he hurried home in a state of mind inconceivably
                  painful. He thought it best, knowing his daughter's character, to tell her the
                  truth, and also to impart at once to her his suspicion of the cause.
               "Have you found him, father?" were her eager words, as he entered.
               "No, my child; and I am afraid will not soon.
               "Oh, what do you mean? He is not dead, father? Tell me at once—O, tell me—I can
                  bear it, father—don't fear me." Her wild eye, pale cheek, and look of eager and
                  alarmed expectation, showed how little prepared she was to bear any such startling
                  announcement.
               "No, Jane, he is not dead."
               "Thank God!" was her quick ejaculation—"thank God! he is not dead." And she sobbed
                  and laughed for a few moments, hysterically.
               Recovering herself in a brief space, she said in renewed alarm, "Then, father,
                  where is he?"
               "Sit down, my child, and I will tell you all I know. Strengthen your heart to bear
                  the burden, Jane, for it is one that will have to be borne,—not thrown aside. I
                  have lately discovered that your husband has drawn out of the business, in cash,
                  during the last year, about five thousand dollars. He had no use for all this
                  money, if he did not visit the gaming table, where, I fear much, he has squandered
                  this large sum. After searching for him in vain all day, Mr.—told me that he saw
                  him enter the western stage at six o'clock this morning, in company with a noted
                  gambler. Something is wrong, and I much fear that too soon we will bear of that
                  which will make us wish we had never seen or known him."
               Eagerly had his daughter looked him in the face while he was speaking, and now,
                  when he paused, she clasped her hands together, and lifting up a countenance of
                  unutterable despair, murmured, "my poor babes," and sunk senseless upon the
                  floor.
               Here was the consummation of her worst fears. She had long had strange suspicions
                  that all was not right, and now the dreaded blow had fallen, and fallen with an
                  unexpected force. No wonder that, for a time, she yielded to the shock.
               For many weeks Jane Fells did not hold up her head, and for most of that time it
                  was feared she would never again look out upon the world—that she would never
                     pass the door-stone, until borne out
                  by the mourners. And Mr. Power was in a state of mind, that was hardly rational.
                  The calm, business-like energy that had heretofore characterized him, yielded to a
                  nervous, agitated, undecided manner. The fact of his partner having left an
                  apparently good business under such singular circumstances, led many to suppose
                  that all was not right; and, consequently, the credit of the house was shaken, in
                  a manner that rendered the situation of Mr. Power really embarrassing. To make
                  things worse, one of the dashing customers of the junior partner failed, and the
                  house of Power and Fells held his notes to the amount of fifteen thousand dollars.
                  The loss was total.
               To fill up the measure of embarrassment, a notice was received from one of the
                  banks of a note due in a few days of ten thousand dollars. No such note appearing
                  upon the bill-book, Mr. Power went to the bank, and soon understood, for himself,
                  that the note had been made by his son-in-law. Knowing that the only way to
                  completely overwhelm the sinking credit of the house, would be to let the note lay
                  over, he, with some difficulty, raised the money and cancelled the fictitious
                  obligation.
               Scarcely was the evidence of his partner's guilt fairly out of bank, when ten
                  notices from different banks were left, each calling for the payment of two
                  thousand dollars in two weeks;—so utterly regardless, it seems, had been Mr.
                  Fells, as to the dates and time of the notes he had, to all intents and purposes,
                  forged. The bill-book of the firm showed, of course, no memorandum of these
                  obligations.
               In the case of Mr. Power, as in the case of thousands of others, troubles came not
                  singly. Ere the due day of these notes rolled around, notice came of three
                  suspensions in St. Louis, each of which heavily involved his house. But it is
                  needless for me to linger in detail. It was soon noised abroad that the house of
                  Power and Fells had failed, and the rumour was not without foundation. One of the
                  old school of merchants, Mr. Power's mercantile integrity was dear to him as the
                  apple of his eye; and now that it was tainted by suspicion, his head sunk upon his
                  bosom, never to rise again. He gave up everything into the hands of
                  trustees,—goods, accounts, real estate and all, and retired with his daughter and
                  her children, to a little farm a few miles from the city, which belonged to his
                  wife, and which had been made over to his daughter so soon as her mother had died.
                  He had one satisfaction, in the final settlement of his business, and that was,
                  that it paid one hundred cents in the dollar. After this result was known, he sunk
                  into a gloomy, listless state, and in one year, was laid at rest in the grave.
               When Mrs. Fells turned away from the grave of her father, and with her two
                  children went back to her home, it was in sadness and gloom. Even though, to her,
                  the heavens had long been enveloped in blackness, there had been still shining
                  out, from amid the thick clouds and darkness, one bright star; but now that star
                  had gone down for ever. Until within three years, she had known none of the trials
                  and afflictions of life. Alas! how many had been crowded upon her in that brief
                  time? Father and mother both laid in the grave, and a husband lost to all honour
                  and shame.
               When she sat down in her desolate dwelling with her babes, and the darkness of
                  night fell gradually around them, she felt forsaken of all—even of her God: for
                  she had not learned to put her trust in him who is a friend to the widow and the
                  fatherless. For more than an hour had she yielded up thus to an overmastering
                  despondency, since the night-fall, and still she sat buried in gloom, and almost
                  despair, without a single friend to whisper a word of comfort, when she was
                  surprised by a loud knock at the door. As the servant opened to the demand, Mrs.
                  Fells was startled by the sound of her own name, in the tones of a well-known
                  voice, and in the next moment her husband stood before her—her husband, but oh,
                  how changed! Pale and emaciated, he was but the shadow of his former self. His
                  clothes were worn and poor, and betokened extreme poverty and degradation. In his
                  face were the marks of dissipation, and the harsh lines of unholy thoughts and
                  evil passions. But Jane saw none of these,—the being who was dearer to her than
                  all the world, stood before her, and she only saw him as such. She had ever loved
                  him with a fervent and unwavering love, even though he had almost broken her
                  heart; and now, that he had come back to her again, after a long and heart-sickening absence, she opened wide her
                  arms to receive him.
               "My dear husband!" was all she could say, as she sprang towards him, and fell
                  almost senseless in his arms.
               "Jane—can you, will you, forgive me?"
               "All—all, dear husband!"
               Such a reception he had not expected. Selfish in his own feelings, he knew nothing
                  of the deep wells of affection that often lie hid in a woman's heart. Forced by
                  sickness and want, for he had run rapidly his downward career, to return home, or
                  die, he had approached the spot where his wife had retired with anxious
                  reluctance. Reproaches he looked for, but to meet in their place forgiveness and
                  love, melted his heart; and in tears—tears of sincere repentance—he confessed his
                  errors, and promised to lead a new life.
               Hope soon revived in the breast of his stricken-hearted wife, for Mr. Fells,
                  confined to the house by sickness, and having neither inclination nor opportunity,
                  under such circumstances, for the indulgence of any of his evil habits, showed so
                  much regard for, and interest in, his wife and children, and so much sorrow for
                  his former conduct, that she fondly hoped that all would be well again.
               As he gradually recovered under his wife's untiring care, Mr. Fell began to feel a
                  returning desire to mingle again in society. There had been, with him, no
                  cultivation of the moral faculties, and but little of the intellectual, and he,
                  therefore, had neither the attractions of mind to win him to solitude, nor the
                  stern admonitions of principle to keep him from again throwing aside as worthless
                  the peace of her who had received him with open arms when he had no place in which
                  to lay his head.
               Strange as it may seem to some, the first time he could walk as far as the city,
                  he came home in a fever of intoxication. Anxiously had his poor wife looked out
                  for him, hour after hour, as the day wore away, hoping and fearing, and sick at
                  heart, with conflicting emotions. She had not suffered so much since the day when
                  it was told her that her husband had forsaken his wife and his babes. As the
                  twilight began to fall, she strained her eyes into the distance with eager
                  anxiety, and at last discerned his well-known form. Her heart throbbed wildly as
                  she caught the first glimpse of her husband, but she could soon see, as he
                  approached, that all was not right; and when he came up to where she stood, and
                  she saw his condition, she could but just turn and stagger into the house. He was
                  too much under the influence of strong drink to observe his wife's distress, and
                  began talking in great good-humour of the prospect which had suddenly burst upon
                  him, since he had gone into the city, of getting into a good business. A friend
                  had met him, an old friend, and had held out large inducements. All that was
                  required was a small capital; with that, they could soon be as they once were.
                  Mrs. Fells understood the meaning of all this, as well as did her drunken husband.
                  This was but the first intimation of a design, cherished ever since he returned
                  home, to get into his own hands the little property, made over to her by her
                  father. She persuaded him to go to bed, where he was soon snoring in drunken
                  insensibility.
               How suddenly were all her hopes scattered, like chaff before the whirlwind! And
                  thus have the hopes of thousands been scattered.
               Next morning, Mr. Fells remembered something of the condition in which he had come
                  home the night before, and the distressed manner and look of his wife admonished
                  him that she had but too closely observed it. Although a little angry with himself
                  for his conduct, he felt more angry with his wife for showing her disapproval of
                  it, and put on a cross, offended air. At the breakfast-table, he sat silent, with
                  brow drawn down, and every exhibition of angry feeling. His poor wife, seeing
                  this, felt a double weight upon her heart, and of course, could not assume a
                  cheerful air. He determined, in his own mind, that she put on a cross look to
                  reprove him for what he had done, and he was not going to be thus threatened like
                  a child. Not a word had been spoken during the breakfast hour, until Mr. Fells, in
                  tasting a cup of coffee, found that it had not been sweetened.
               "This coffee is as bitter as your looks—Give me some sugar!"—said he, crossly.
               As she reached him the sugar, the tears started from the eyes of his wife, and
                  almost blinded her.
               "What in the devil are you blubbering about this morning? One would think you had met with some
                  terrible calamity."
               She sealed her lips in silence, for her heart was too full to speak. The blow had
                  fallen too suddenly upon her.
               "If you expect me to stay at home." continued he, "you must make home pleasant. I
                  shall not stay here if there are to be clouds and rains all the while."
               Even to this Mrs. Fells spoke not a word, and her husband resumed his silent,
                  dogged air.
               After breakfast, he went out upon the little farm, and looked to some improvements
                  that were going on. This gave him an opportunity for reflection. It is true that
                  he spent the first hour in blaming his wife for her "crossness," as he called it,
                  but after awhile a spark of feeling kindled in his bosom, and he felt that he was
                  the more criminal of the two.
               And Mrs. Fells, what were her thoughts! It was the first time he had done
                  anything, since he had returned, to shake the dear hopes she was cherishing in her
                  bosom, and she could not help showing the deep distress that passed upon her
                  stricken heart. But now that she had painful evidence of the effect the exhibition
                  of such distress had upon her husband, true to the character of a woman, she
                  resolved to hide deep in her bosom the pain, and to meet him even with a smiling
                  face.
               Such reflections and resolutions on both sides, of course, made the meeting at
                  dinner-time a pleasanter one. Mr. Fells came to the house, with a feeling of pity
                  for his wife, though with no thought of conciliation on his part, and was of
                  course ready for the salutary effect of her altered look and manner. He was a
                  little reserved at first, but the entire change in his wife soon re-assured him,
                  and he was cheerful and talkative. The effect which this hiding of her feelings
                  had upon her husband, Mrs. Fells thought was an ample reward for the effort.
               The allusion which he had made while drunk to an offer to go into business, was
                  not an imaginary one. An individual, to whom, while half-intoxicated, he had been
                  boasting of the fine farm which he owned, had suggested to him the advantage of
                  selling it, and entering into business with him. He stated that he was now
                  clearing so much every year, and if he could only add a few hundred dollars to his
                  capital, and a partner in the active business of the concern, he could quadruple
                  the profits.
               In a day or two, Fells broached the subject to his wife, but she opposed it at
                  once. The farm she said now yielded them a good living, and he was more removed
                  from temptation there than in the city.
               Never disposed to argue a point with his wife, and understanding at once that she
                  had no confidence in him, he got terribly angry, and threatened to sell the whole
                  property in spite of her. She made no reply, but firmly resolved that she would
                  never consent to have the property sold.
               Foiled in the attempt to convince his wife of the utility of selling the farm, he
                  determined never to give her a kind look or word, until she consented to its
                  disposition. And now commenced the terrible conflict—terrible, did I say? Ay.
                  TERRIBLE to the heart of a suffering wife!
               From the rising of the sun to its going down, she knew no kind look, and heard no
                  word from her husband that was not a word of anger or reproach. Even her little
                  children saw and felt the change, and looked fearful and distressed. Often would
                  their father scold and beat them, for no other purpose, it seemed, than to make a
                  cause for angry contention with his wife, to whom they would fly for protection,
                  and who was ever ready to meet even his anger and abuse in their cause. Frequently
                  he would go off to the city, with the avowed purpose of offering the property for
                  sale to the highest bidder;—generally, on such occasions, he would come home
                  intoxicated, and, not unfrequently did Mrs. Fells endure more than hard words.
               Worn out at last, and feeling almost regardless of consequences,—Mrs. Fells
                  consented to sell the farm, and suffer her husband to go into business with the
                  proceeds. Her approbation being once gained, little time was lost in disposing of
                  it.
               It was a sad day for her, when she left this refuge from the world in her former
                  days of sore distress, and left it for ever. A snug two story house was rented in
                  the city, and here they took up their abode. The farm brought fifteen hundred
                  dollars, and the whole of this was invested ed in a grocery store. (The affairs of the person
                  who had proposed to take Fells into business with him, had for some time been in a
                  desperate condition, and had come to a crisis some months previous.)
               I will not take the reader along, step by step, in tracing the course of this man
                  down to beggary. It would be but consuming his own time and mine to little
                  purpose. Suffice it to say, that at the end of eighteen months, the grocery store
                  had dwindled down to a grog-shop, with a few kegs and decanters of liquor, a box
                  or two of herrings, and a few trifling things in the window, to make a show. To
                  this grog-shop, Fells was about the best customer. For some months, the income of
                  the shop had been insufficient to support the family, and the deficiency Mrs.
                  Fells made up by taking in plain sewing. He was generally drunk from the middle of
                  the day until night, and during that time, this accomplished and sensitive woman
                  had to stand behind the counter and mix liquors for every worthless drunken
                  vagabond that chose to enter. To this she could never get accustomed, and she did
                  indeed feel her degradation, while thus forced to partake in the sin of the
                  drunkard. Many and many a time did her heart bleed, as she poured out the
                  maddening draught for those she knew were beggaring their families, and drinking
                  confusion to their wives and children. But the end after awhile came to all this.
                  Their rent having remained for some time unpaid, their landlord seized upon their
                  things, and turned them out of their house with little besides the clothes on
                  their backs.
               There lived in — street, in a splendid mansion, a lady, who had once been
                  seamstress in the family of Mr. Power. She had married a young man who had been
                  enterprising and thrifty in business, and who had grown rich, during prosperous
                  times, rapidly. His wife, who was a proud, ignorant, and vulgar woman, would have
                  everything on the most splendid scale,—and truly their dwelling showed everything
                  in costly style, if not in all things accordant to a cultivated taste. Beside the
                  mansion of this lady, was a poor hovel of frame work, and only one story high.
                  This was rented by Mr. Fells, and here his needy family retired. Creatures so poor
                  and so abject as these, were not noticed by the purse-proud Mrs. Conklen, who
                  would have felt that there was contamination in their touch. I merely mention the
                  striking fact of the reverse in the fortunes of these two individuals, and the
                  incident of their being thrown beside each other in their altered fortunes.—Many
                  of my readers can call to mind a similar fact.
               Mrs. Fells' two children were still living—one four years old, and the other
                  between two and three. To procure food and raiment for these, was now her chief
                  concern. Persons in her former situation, cannot imagine how they would get along
                  if reduced to abject poverty, with helpless babes dependent on their labour, and
                  not a single friend in the world to help them. But when the trial comes, it must
                  be met, and the difficulties overcome. A few things not taken by the selfish
                  landlord, and which could be spared, were sold, and food enough bought to last
                  them a couple of weeks. This took away from the mind of Mrs. Fells the confusion
                  of immediate want, and she sat down calmly to reflect upon the best course she
                  could pursue. There were no families in the neighbourhood who knew that she could
                  or would do fine sewing, even if they had it to give out. At last she made up her
                  mind to apply at the clothing stores for work. From these she got coarse shirts to
                  make, and received for them eight cents apiece. She could make two of these a day,
                  and sometimes, by working very late, three, besides attending to her family. It
                  was indeed but a small pittance that she thus earned, but it was at least a
                  protection against complete starvation.
               The necessity for pinching economy forced her to cut off the remnant of comforts
                  which she had retained—tea, coffee, and milk, except a little for the youngest
                  child, were banished from the table, and the principal meals were made of potatoes
                  and dry bread, with a little meat once a day. There were four of them, one a
                  hearty man, and the provision for all these, was less than twenty-five cents a
                  day. Her brute of a husband would do nothing, except pile lumber occasionally on
                  the wharf, or some such occasional drudgery, merely for the purpose of getting
                  liquor.
               There resided opposite to the hovel where they lived a benevolent lady, who had
                  for sometime noticed the move ments of
                  Mrs. Fells, but had no idea of her almost entire destitution. She remarked on one
                  occasion that she had not seen Mrs. Fells for several days, and determined to call
                  in and ascertain if anything was the matter.
               To her knock at the door, she heard a feeble "come in," and entering, she was
                  pained at heart, to note so many tokens of extreme poverty. The only furniture to
                  be seen was a pine table, a few broken chairs, some kitchen utensils, and a
                  bedstead, upon which were placed a few old quilts to answer for a bed. On these
                  was laid a pale, emaciated form, whose eager eyes looked searchingly into her
                  face, and then wandered away to two little children who had fallen asleep in the
                  middle of the floor.
               "I am sorry to find you sick, ma'am," said her visiter. "Are you very ill?"
               "I have not been able to hold up my head this whole day, nor to sit up in my bed
                  for two or three."
               "What can I do for you?"
               "I want nothing, ma'am, but my poor children have had but little to eat for two
                  days," said Mrs. Fells, bursting into tears.
               "For two days? Dreadful! Poor things!" and the good-hearted woman, lifted them up
                  from the floor, gently, thus arousing them from slumber. The youngest began to
                  moan piteously, the oldest to cry in silence, both looking imploringly towards
                  their sick mother—and each asking for "bread." The mother turned her head away,
                  and sobbed aloud.
               "Come with me, and I will give you some bread," said the lady to them.
               The children looked at her a moment, and turned again to their mother, moaning and
                  crying as before.
               The lady left the house, and quickly returned with nourishing food, and soon had
                  the delight of seeing the little ones eagerly satisfying the cravings of
                  hunger.
               A servant had been dispatched for one of the physicians for the poor, who
                  happening to be in, came round immediately. He bled his patient, and gave her
                  medicines, and the kind lady who had been a friend in her extremity, prepared for
                  her, with her own hand, nourishing and cooling drinks, and provided a sufficiency
                  of food for her children. She also sent her a bed, and made it up for her with her
                  own hands. Every morning, while she remained sick, she made a servant go over and
                  clean up her little room, and see that she had a good breakfast; and she always
                  looked in herself, two or three times during the day, to see how her patient and
                  her children were doing.
               When Mrs. Fells got better, this kind woman gave her more profitable work herself,
                  and made interest for her in the neighbourhood. In a little time she had as much
                  fine sewing as she could do, for which she obtained a good price; but with her
                  most active industry she could earn but a poor support for herself and family.
               A kind friend in her extremity was, to Mrs. Fells, like bread to the hungry. It
                  had been a long, long time since any one had seemed to care for her. All the
                  friends of her better days had fallen away, like leaves from the sapless branches
                  in autumn. But now a stranger had come to her humble abode, and was to her a
                  friend and a parent. She had never, in all her keen suffering, lifted her heart to
                  God, for she was not taught early to pray. But when she remembered the gentle,
                  unobtrusive, and heart-felt kindness of this friend, she lifted up, almost
                  involuntarily, her thoughts, and asked of God, her soul melted into tears, to
                  shower upon her his choicest blessings. A poet has beautifully said, that "Dear
                  unto God are the prayers of the poor"—For my part, I would rather have had the
                  prayer of that poor mother—the first that ever went up from her heart—than the
                  prayers of all christendom.
               At first, many kind neighbours joined to make her situation comfortable, but
                  finding that a part of whatever they did went to support a drunken, lazy husband,
                  nearly all relaxed in their charitable actions; and although for a while Mrs.
                  Fells got along, with small assistance, quite comfortably, yet in a few months,
                  she was nearly forgotten by all save one.
               From some cause it became necessary for her to move away from her neighbourhood,
                  and beyond the reach of her kind friend, who saw nothing more of her for many
                  years. What she suffered in that time is only known to Him whose eyes are abroad
                  upon all the earth, and who comforteth the poor when no man careth for them.
               
               It was a cold morning in winter, when a ragged boy about twelve years old, knocked
                  at the door, and, on being admitted, said that Mrs. Fells had sent a request that
                  she would come and see her before she died.
               "Mrs. Fells, did you say? Certainly, my boy—Where does she live?"
               "In — street."
               "Whereabouts in — street?"
               "I will go with you, ma'am."
               In a few minutes she was ready to attend the boy. When she arrived at the house,
                  she was conducted up an old rickety stair-case, and far back in an old building,
                  where, on a comfortless bed, in a room with no furniture but a couple of chairs,
                  and a broken table, lay the sick and dying woman.
               "God bless you, for coming!" said she, in a faint voice. She was evidently near
                  her last moments, and sinking rapidly.
               "Can I do anything for you?" said the kind lady.
               "Yes, one thing, and it is for this I have sent for you. My children! I could not
                  part with them while I lived; but there is a relation of my father's who never
                  cared to look after me, and I could not go to him. I want you to go to him with
                  little Mary, after I am dead, and ask him, from me, to take her into his family.
                  My dying request he cannot pass by lightly. If he will not think it too much
                  trouble, I should like him to look after Charles."
               At this moment her husband entered with a minister. The scene which followed—the
                  dying scene—beggars description. Fells was just drunk enough to be a perfect fool.
                  The minister was evidently much annoyed by his familiar manner; for he talked and
                  bustled about with an air of great importance. The dying woman turned her eyes,
                  upon the man of God as he came in, with an eager and anxious look. He took his
                  seat by her side in silence, and for some moments not a word was spoken.
               "Hadn't you better pray with her, sir? she is sinking very fast," said her
                  husband, in a tone of drunken sorrow, sobbing aloud as he spoke.
               Under the circumstances, nothing better could be done, and the minister kneeling
                  by the bedside, poured out his soul in prayer for the dying woman. When he arose
                  up, Fells went to a closet, and after searching about for some time, produced an
                  old hymn-book, tattered and torn, and handing it to the minister, said—
               "Perhaps you would like to sing, sir."
               The minister took the book in silence, and then turning to the sick woman,
                  commenced talking to her in a low tone.
               * * * * * *
               For more than an hour had the minister talked and prayed with her, and now she
                  began to fail rapidly. He suggested that she should receive the symbols of the
                  broken body and shed blood of the Saviour.
               "O, sir, I am unworthy."
               "But no one is worthy."
               "O, sir, I cannot partake of the sacred symbols. To me that sacrament has
                  presented an act so hallowed, that I never could feel like approaching—I fear to
                  eat unworthily."
               "You cannot eat unworthily, if you are sincere. Do not make the ceremony greater
                  than the Lord of the ceremony. If you can approach Christ and be accepted, surely
                  you can approach his table."
               At the word sacrament, Mr. Fells was off in a moment to a store for some wine, and
                  on returning, had got a piece of hard bread from the closet. He stood for a few
                  moments at the foot of the bed, where the minister could not see him, with a
                  bottle containing some wine in one hand, and the bread in the other, enforcing the
                  minister's arguments by sundry threatening looks, and whispered curses. At this
                  dreadful sight, Mrs. Fells closed her eyes, but could not shut it out from her
                  imagination. The minister ceased speaking—and Fells taking advantage of the pause,
                  said—
               "Here is the wine, sir, get ready, and she SHALL take it."
               The poor woman turned her dying eyes upon the minister, and murmured,
               "I will take it, sir."
               The minister never broke sacred bread under more solemn emotions. Kneeling beside
                  the bed where lay one of the same family, of which his God was the God and Father, he lifted up, with tearful
                  eyes, his heart, and prayed, that God would seal the peace of his dying
                  servant.
               He then placed the consecrated bread upon her lips, and poured for her the blood
                  of the New Covenant;—and, even while she drank of the cup, her spirit passed
                  away—to eat of the bread of life, and to drink the new wine in the kingdom of her
                  Father.
               Thus ends the sad history of this poor victim of a hasty and injudicious marriage.
                  The lesson needs no words of mine to enforce it. As to the dying scene, that is
                  true to the letter. I had it from the lips of her own son, upon whose young mind
                  it made a strong and painful impression. The drunken father died soon after in the
                  almshouse.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     The April Fool.
                  
               
               THE APRIL FOOL.
               "HADN'T we the fun with old Mr. Bender, Tom!"
               "Hadn't we!" returned the lad, thus addressed. "Oh, but wasn't he mad!"
               Thus spoke two boys together, on returning from school at dinner time, on the
                  first day of April. Their mother, overhearing their words, said—
               "What about Mr. Bender, boys?"
               "Oh, we had such fun with him, mother, as we went to school this morning," replied
                  Tom.
               "And he was so mad," said Harry, the brother of Tom.
               "Why did he get angry with you?" inquired the mother.
               "We made such a fool of him," was answered.
               "Of old Mr. Bender?"
               "Yes, indeed. Tom tore from a fence a part of a showbill, on which was printed
                  'Great Excitement,' and stole up behind Mr. Bender and pinned it fast to his coat.
                  Then hadn't we the fun!"
               "And didn't he get mad! All the boys pointed at him, and called him 'April Fool;'
                  and the men laughed. Oh! it was such fun!"
               The mother of the boys did not smile at this, but looked very serious.
               "I am sorry," said she, "that you did this, my boys. It was wrong."
               "Oh, but it was only for fun, mother. To-day is the first of April, you know, and
                  he needn't have got so angry about it. It only made the people laugh at him the
                  more. But, he is such a cross old fellow."
               "My children," said the mother, "let me tell you something that happened
                  to-day."
               
               The little boys became serious, and came up close to their mother and
                  listened.
               "You know," said she, "that Mrs. Judkins has been sick all winter?"
               "Yes, ma'am," was answered.
               "And that she is poor?"
               "Yes, ma'am."
               "Well, her Andrew, who is no older than you, Henry, had to be taken from school
                  and put to work in a printing-office, where he has been receiving a dollar and a
                  quarter a week. Yesterday the little fellow heard that Mr. Bender wanted an office
                  lad, and that he would pay one that suited him two dollars a week. The situation
                  would, besides yielding him more money, be much easier, and he would have time and
                  opportunity to improve his mind.
               "So Andrew told his mother about it, and she agreed with him that it was best to
                  call upon Mr. Bender, who had known his father, and befriended him while living on
                  more than one occasion.
               "'I'm sure he will take me,' said the eager boy, as he left home, 'and oh, how
                  glad I shall be to get away from the printing-office!'
               "A little while before nine o'clock, Andrew stepped around to the office of Mr.
                  Bender, which was not far from where he worked. He opened the door and went in
                  with a hopeful yet trembling heart. Mr. Bender sat in his great arm chair, with a
                  newspaper in his hand. Looking up as the door turned on its hinges, he fixed an
                  angry look upon the boy, and said in a sharp, quick voice—
               "'What do you want? ha!'
               "Poor Andrew's hopes were dashed to the ground by this reception. He stammered
                  out—
               "'Do you want a boy, sir?'
               "'No! Clear out, you little rascal!' replied the old man, in a rough, excited
                  voice.
               "The lad turned away, without a word more, and went back to the printing-office.
                  But, his heart was almost broken by the rude repulse and disappointment. Now, my
                  boys, can you tell why Mr. Bender, who is, in the main, a kind-hearted man,
                  repulsed Andrew Judkin so harshly?"
               "He was angry about something, I suppose," said Thomas.
               "Can you guess what that something was?"
               "Was it because we made him an April fool?"
               "Most probably," returned the mother. "You say he was very angry?"
               "Oh yes. He was as mad as he could be, and shook his fist at us."
               "You had your fun, as you call it," said the mother of the boys, "but poor Andrew
                  Judkin has, in all probability, lost a good place in consequence. He will hardly
                  venture back again to the office of Mr. Bender."
               "I don't think," remarked one of the lads, "that it was very manly in Mr. Bender
                  to get into a passion just because we made him an April fool. We played tricks on
                  other men; but they only laughed at us, and so we had fun all around."
               "All men are not alike," was replied to this. "Some are sensitive on one point,
                  and some on another. Few persons can bear ridicule, though some have the power to
                  conceal its effects, while others have not. Mr. Bender has, naturally, a quick,
                  irritable temper, and is, besides, sensitive to ridicule. Such being the case, it
                  was scarcely possible for him not to get angry when two little boys were so rude
                  as to make sport of him in the street. No doubt he felt mortified afterward for
                  having thus lost his self-control; but ere there had been time enough for this
                  change in his feelings to occur, poor Andrew came with his petition, and received
                  an angry repulse."
               "I'm sorry," said Harry, appearing troubled, "that I made fun of Mr. Bender. I'm
                  sure I wouldn't have done so, if I'd thought he was going to get so very angry.
                  But, if we did wrong, I don't think he did right in treating Andrew as he did.
                  Andrew didn't make fun of him."
               "All injustice is wrong, my son," replied the mother, "and, therefore, Mr. Bender
                  did wrong. Still, the wrong was done while he was, as it were, not himself, and
                  not really conscious of what he was doing. You were to blame for wantonly
                  insulting him, and thus producing the state of mind from which he acted. Yours was
                  the first aggression, and therefore you are quite as much responsi- ble as Mr. Bender for the wrong done to poor Andrew
                  Judkin."
               The boys looked sober. Their mother added—
               "Never, my children, seek pleasure at the expense of another. Think, before you
                  make sport of any one, how you would feel if subject to a like annoyance. There is
                  a Golden Rule by which your actions should ever be governed—'As ye would that men
                  would do unto you, do ye even so to them.' Remember this, hereafter, and set a
                  guard upon yourselves, lest you break it. There are sources enough of pleasure in
                  the world, without seeking it in a trespass upon the rights of others."
            
            
               THE COLD-WATER WEDDING.
               "HARRY SOMERS is to be married to-night."
               "Yes."
               "And is going to get a sweet, good girl, for a wife. Ellen Lewis is a prize worth
                  gaining."
               "She certainly is. But, I'm afraid she's about getting the worst of the
                  bargain."
               "How strange a remark for you to make!—you who know Harry Somers so well, and have
                  always seemed to esteem him so highly."
               "So I have; and so I still do. But then he is, in my opinion, a little bit of the
                  fool. And Ellen, you know, is a girl of sense."
               "I never saw anything about Harry to lead me to such a conclusion."
               "Well, maybe the term fool is a little too strong. But what I meant
                  to convey, was, that he has many queer notions of his own, which I am sure Ellen,
                  with her plain good sense, never will be able to tolerate."
               "I never discovered anything singular in his opinions and actions," the friend
                  replied, "and I have seen a good deal of him."
               "You have noticed, I presume, that when he takes an idea into his head, there is
                  no beating it out of him."
               "If the idea be a true one, I think it would be hard work to make him give it up,
                  certainly."
               "No, but true or false—it is all the same with him. And then he will take up
                  notions of his own, and stick to them, though he become the laughing-stock of the
                  whole world."
               "Name one of these notions."
               "That I can do very easily. There is to be no wine at his wedding, to-night."
               "Indeed!"
               "It's as true as I live. He set his head, I am told, that not a drop of wine should be served at his wedding;
                  and Ellen and her family had to give in to him, though it was done with great
                  reluctance."
               "That is, certainly, a strange notion for him."
               "Aint it?"
               "I suppose he has joined the tee-totallers?"
               "No, I believe not—It all arises from some whim of his own, I presume.—No doubt
                  from a foolish desire to appear singular."
               "Henry Somers never acts from such motives. He is a man of too much good
                  sense."
               "Then, pray, what other motive could he have?"
               "He might have many good ones; and I have not the least doubt that, in this
                  matter, he is governed by pure and just principles."
               "Principles! What in the name of common sense has wine at a wedding to do with
                  principle?"
               "It may have much to do with principle."
               "I cannot see how."
               "Wait patiently, and you will, no doubt, be fully satisfied."
               "No doubt. But do you intend going?"
               "O, certainly."
               "I don't think I shall go."
               "Why not?"
               "It will be a dull, silly affair, I suppose."
               "Don't you believe it."
               "I do, then. Why, every one will be so affected with a sense of the ridiculousness
                  of the farce played off, that all true rational pleasure will be lost. If I were
                  to go, I could not look you or any one else in the face without laughing, to save
                  my life. A wedding, and no wine! Ridiculous!"
               "I cannot see anything so very ridiculous in it, Mudie; nor will you, I am very
                  much inclined to think, if you venture to go."
               "Well, perhaps I may, if it's only to enjoy a good hearty laugh after it's all
                  over."
               The two young men then parted. Their names were Mudie and Lee.
               "I really have no heart to go into company any more," remarked Adeline Whiteman,
                  to her sister Eleanor, sitting down with a dispirited air, as she paused in the
                  work of dressing herself for Ellen Lewis's wedding.
               "Why not, sister?" asked Eleanor.
               "Because, as you know, brother always will drink too much when he gets into
                  company—and it makes me feel wretched. Last week at Mrs. Wheeler's party, you
                  remember how silly he made himself! I was so hurt and mortified that I could have
                  sunk into the floor."
               "Indeed I do remember it. All my pleasure for the evening was spoiled. And so was
                  cousin Mary's. I tried once or twice to sing and play, and thus add my mite to the
                  general enjoyment. But I could not do it with any heart, and was conscious that my
                  performances were failures. Indeed, I heard a gentleman remark in a low tone to
                  his partner:
               "'How indifferently Eleanor plays to-night!'
               "I felt that what he said was just. But I could not help being hurt, for the cause
                  of my failure was one so painful as to break down my spirits."
               "And I," resumed her sister—"tried my best to dance with some life. But in vain.
                  My feelings were so depressed that my very body lost its buoyancy, and my feet
                  felt like lead. I had at last to go and sit down, and refuse to dance any more,
                  though frequently solicited."
               "Why," asked Eleanor, "could not wine and all kinds of intoxicating drinks be
                  banished from social parties? They are not, really, needed; and at this time, when
                  so many have acquired a slavish love of drink, it seems to me not only wrong to
                  put a temptation in their way, but really unkind to a company, met for social
                  enjoyment, thus to endanger their pleasant intercourse. All know, that if one
                  becomes partially intoxicated, it dampens the feelings of the rest. And
                  especially, if that one have a wife, a mother, or a sister present."
               "You remember, of course, the unpleasant, and, indeed, painful occurrence that
                  took place last winter at Mrs. Wolcott's."
               "Indeed, I do! Poor Jane Morven! How my heart did ache for her! I was sitting by
                  her when she first noticed that her husband had been drinking too much. He came up
                  and asked me to dance with him. I observed that he had a strange look and manner,
                  and felt an instant disin- clination to
                  go upon the floor, and therefore politely excused myself. He insisted, however, in
                  a rude way; and I, to prevent observation, consented. I turned to wards his wife
                  as I arose. Her face was pale as ashes! I instantly guessed the cause, which soon
                  became too plainly apparent, even to me. Mr. Morven could not go through a single
                  figure, and acted so badly that he broke up the cotillion in a few minutes. As
                  soon as this occurred, I returned and took my place beside his wife."
               "'O, Eleanor, is it not dreadful?' she said, the tears dimming her eyes, as she
                  turned her pale, sad face, towards me.
               "I did not know what to reply, but merely responded—
               "'It is, indeed, Jane.' And then there followed a long, and, to both of us, a
                  painfully embarrassing silence. This was broken by the appearance of her husband,
                  who, still more intoxicated, came up, and standing before us, went on with a
                  parcel of drivelling nonsense for about five minutes, that disgusted me as much as
                  it must have pained and mortified his poor wife. Just then, a friend of his who
                  saw his condition, considerately drew him aside, and prevailed on him to go home.
                  Jane was quietly informed that he was about leaving, and as quietly withdrew, much
                  to the relief of many, who saw, and deeply pitied her situation."
               "If there had been neither wine nor brandy tendered to their guests by Mr. and
                  Mrs. Wolcott, on that evening," Adeline remarked, "how much of exquisite suffering
                  to at least one heart might have been saved! For more than three months, Mr.
                  Morven, conscious of his weakness, had steadily persevered in refraining from the
                  use of liquor. The consequence was, that Jane had begun to feel a degree of
                  confidence and hope that she had not experienced for a long time. The temptation
                  offered her husband at that party was too strong, and he fell; and fell, alas!
                  into a perfect abandonment of himself, for many weeks, to the insane pleasures of
                  intoxication.
               "' It sometimes seems, Adeline,' she said to me one day, during this period,
                  leaning her head upon my shoulder, and giving way to tears, 'that my heart must
                  break! O, it is a terrible affliction for one so young as I, and all unfitted
                  fitted to bear the lot of misery too surely in reversion for me!"
               "I could only weep with her, for I could give no word of comfort. I felt that
                  there was something so hopeless about her lot, that it would be like mockery to
                  offer vain words of encouragement. But I must not sit here, giving way to
                  desponding thoughts. To the wedding we must go."
               "Yes.—Our families are too intimate, for us to think of not going. And Ellen is
                  one of my dearest friends. I am glad she is about to do so well.—Henry Somers is a
                  young man of sterling principles."
               "Brother Edward will go, of course"
               "O, yes, of course. He told me to-day, that he should be there."
               "I do hope he will have prudence enough not to drink too much. But I tremble when
                  I think of it. He so soon forgets himself."
               The two young ladies then proceeded to dress for the wedding, with heavy hearts.
                  At the appointed time, accompanied by their brother, they entered Mr. Lewis's
                  brilliantly lighted parlours, already filled with a gay company assembled to
                  witness the marriage ceremony. For half an hour or so, a light and lively
                  conversation ran round the room, which was broken by the entrance of the parties
                  to be united. The minister met them as they came in, and immediately the
                  impressive ceremony began, and soon progressed to its termination. All was then
                  for a few moments salutes and congratulations, with a moving to and fro, and, a
                  mingling of all together in one mass of happy confusion. Then order was gradually
                  and spontaneously restored, and servants entered with the bride's cake. For a few
                  moments, Adeline and Eleanor had forgotten their fears in the delight they
                  experienced from seeing their young friend so happy. The sight of the waiters and
                  refreshments recalled them to a painful recollection of the danger they so much
                  dreaded. Both felt a sickening sensation pass over them. But they rallied their
                  feelings with an effort.
               "I see Mr. and Mrs. Morven here," Adeline remarked to her sister.
               
               "Yes," was the reply. "And I suppose Jane's poor heart is trembling."
               "No doubt." Then after a pause—"That is not wine, surely, that the servants are
                  passing around?"
               "O, yes. Whoever heard of anything but wine following the bride's cake?"
               "If it is wine, it is white, and contained in lemonade-glasses!"
               "Lemonade-glasses? Sure enough! But it cannot possibly be lemonade?"
               "Yes, I expect so, and most earnestly do I hope that it is! How much more
                  refreshing as a beverage than wine!"
               "To me it is. But we will soon see. For here it comes."
               As Eleanor said this, the servant paused before her, and she lifted a glass from
                  the waiter which he bore, and placed it to her lips.
               "All right, sister," she said, in a cheerful tone.
               "But isn't it a strange idea?" remarked Adeline.
               "It's a very good idea."
               "So it is. But I wonder if wine will not be served."
               "No doubt it will. But how happy I should be, and how happy poor Jane Morven would
                  be, if nothing stronger than lemonade were offered to the company!"
               "This is very refreshing, Mr. Mudie," remarked a lady by the side of that young
                  gentleman, as she sipped, with an air of satisfaction, her cool lemonade,
                  perfectly unconscious of the omission to serve wine that had been allowed to take
                  place.
               "Very refreshing, indeed!" responded the young man, raising his glass to his lips,
                  involuntarily, and sipping, in turn, the pleasant beverage. "On a warm evening
                  like this, nothing is more grateful to the taste."
               "Why, look how lively and cheerful Adeline Whiteman and her sister have grown all
                  at once," said his companion, directing Mr. Mudie's attention towards the young
                  ladies to whom she had alluded. "They have seemed dull ever since they came into
                  the room."
               "So I remarked. But a gleam of sunshine appears suddenly to have fallen upon
                  them."
               "At the last party where I met them," resumed the lady—"they seemed to enjoy
                  themselves but little. Both sing and play exquisitely, and dance with almost
                  unequalled grace and spirit; but of late, in parties, they have not seemed
                  themselves. Their playing has not been so skilful; and only in plaintive and
                  touching airs, have they for some time exhibited their musical powers. In these,
                  they sometimes, especially when they sing together, move you almost to tears."
               "It is strange, is it not?" the young man said, musingly
               "It certainly is. Something is, no doubt, wrong at home. But as to its nature, I
                  have no idea."
               "Does it not seem a little strange that they should have brightened up so
                  suddenly?"
               "It does, indeed. There, do you see that sweet, happy smile, how it melts over,
                  and makes radiant every feature of Eleanor's lovely face, as she replies to some
                  question put to her by Mr. Lewis, who has just come up, and is passing, no doubt,
                  merely the simple compliments of the evening."
               "How like the smile that used to play there a few months ago; but of late,
                  strangely banished from its lovely resting place! What can be the cause of the
                  change that has taken place in both of them during the past year?"
               "I have sometimes thought," the lady replied, "that their brother is becoming
                  dissipated. He almost always drinks too much on an occasion like this, and
                  sometimes makes himself very foolish."
               "Yes, I have noticed this several times, and it may be that this has something to
                  do with the change that has taken place in them. It must mortify and pain them
                  exceedingly."
               "So I should think. You remember how much he was out of the way a few weeks ago at
                  your house."
               "Yes, very well. So much so that I was not only mortified at his conduct, but so
                  offended with him, as almost to resolve never again to invite him to the house.
                  Were it not for his interesting sisters, I am sure that I would not."
               "I observed, on that occasion," remarked the lady, with whom Mudie was conversing,
                  "that the spirits of the sisters seemed to droop, as he became more and more excited with drink, and that their eyes
                  often followed him about with a sad expression."
               "How I do pity them!" Mudie said, in an earnest sympathising tone. "But they need
                  have no fears to-night."
               "Why not, Mr. Mudie?"
               "Didn't you know that this was to be a kind of cold-water wedding?" returned the
                  young man with a broad smile.
               "No," in a tone of surprise.
               "It is, then."
               "A cold-water wedding! I don't know that I exactly understand you, Mr. Mudie."
               "A wedding at which there is to be nothing stronger than cold-water to drink, or
                  lemonade, which is the same thing. But isn't it a queer notion?"
               "It is certainly something new to me; but the idea seems most excellent, seeing
                  that the pleasure of an evening like this is so often marred by the departure of
                  some weak one from true sobriety. Especially to two young ladies situated as
                  Adeline and Eleanor Whiteman are, it is an act of true charity."
               "No doubt it is. But I presume it will be a dull affair. Without a little wine,
                  now and then, to bring up the spirits, a social party must be a laboured
                  affair."
               "I cannot see how that need be, Mr. Mudie. Now, I for one, never drink wine, and I
                  could point you to a dozen other ladies in the room who do not. Neither of us, I
                  believe, is at all famed for dulness in company. I know you will give me credit,
                  at least, for not sitting all the evening with my hands in my lap, and simpering
                  out a feeble, 'yes sir,' and 'no sir,' to all that is said to me."
               "O, yes, I will give you credit for being lively enough. But every one hasn't your
                  flow of spirits. I, for instance, always feel my tongue and my ideas, too, locked
                  up, until the wine begins to circulate."
               "Excuse me for saying, Mr. Mudie, that I do not perceive but that your ideas flow
                  very readily, and that I can see no fault in your expression of them."
               "I don't know how it may seem to you, madam, but I am, myself, conscious of a
                  feeling of constraint, that I should not experience, if I had taken a glass or two
                  of wine. I am not only at a loss for subjects of conversation tion, but do not
                  find language so readily, nor experience that ease and self-possession that I do
                  under the gentle excitement of a little generous wine."
               "You can bear to hear the truth, can you not, Mr. Mudie?" his companion said, in a
                  graver tone, looking him with a kind, but more serious expression, in the
                  face.
               "From you, I can, madam."
               "Are you sure?"
               "O, yes, I am sure of that. Speak plainly, and to the point."
               "That is a privilege that we married ladies sometimes take, especially after we
                  have attained some little age on one side, with it corresponding experience."
               "Don't be afraid. I can bear the truth."
               "Very well. I have met you in company a good many times within the last two years;
                  and have observed you about as carefully as I observe most young men whom I thus
                  meet—and that is pretty closely. Now, the result of this is, that I like your
                  company and conversation at the beginning of a party, but never towards the
                  end."
               "Why not, Mrs.—?"
               "The reason is easily given. Before the generous wine takes effect, you are, to
                  me, an intelligent and rational young man."
               "But Mrs.—, I never drink too much wine," the young man said, in surprise.
               "Perhaps not. But there is, certainly, to me, a very great change in you, always,
                  towards the conclusion of a social party."
               "You must really be mistaken, madam."
               "Persons of my age and habits of observation are rarely mistaken in a matter like
                  this, Mr. Mudie."
               "You surprise and pain me greatly, Mrs.—. Can what you say be really true, or only
                  the effect of your own imagination?"
               "Trust, me, my dear sir, that all I say is too true. More than once has my
                  attention been called to the fact by others, thus corroborating what I thought I
                  saw myself. But you are not alone in this, my young friend. I could name to you
                  several of your acquaintances, who, while they think that they are making
                  themselves peculiarly interesting in a party, are rendering themselves in the eyes of not a few, extremely
                  foolish. Their suavity of manners, their 
                     briliant
                     brilliant
                   sayings, indeed, the whole tenor of all that appertains to them while
                  under the excitement of 'generous wine,' are sometimes seen and heard with pain or
                  disgust."
               "Indeed, indeed, Mrs.—, you draw too strong a picture."
               "Perhaps I do. But could I draw such a picture without something of an original?
                  Let me, however, refer to Mrs.—, here, who has been listening to our
                  conversation."
               The lady referred to, a mutual acquaintance said, in answer to the appeal,
               "Like you, Mrs.—, I have too frequently observed, that after a few glasses of wine
                  at a party, and, perhaps, a little brandy, too, from the side-board, our young men
                  become much livelier; but lose a measure of their intelligence, and of course,
                  their interest for me. They talk much more freely, but the superabundance is mere
                  froth, that conceals the body and soul of genuine rationality. They can bow and
                  smile, and gracefully incline their bodies into attitudes, but—"
               "Say no more—say no more, if you please!" Mr. Mudie ejaculated, interrupting the
                  lady who had been referred to; "or, I shall be so mortified that I cannot enjoy
                  this cold-water wedding at all. My feelings are already almost down to zero, and
                  with no wine to bring them up, I fear my company will be anything but interesting
                  and agreeable."
               "We shall all enjoy ourselves, very much, I have not the least doubt; and you,
                  among the rest," was the reply. "As happy a face to look upon as Adeline
                  Whiteman's is now, and as gay a partner as her sister when in fine spirits, will
                  do more to put life into my young friend, Mr. Mudie, than a whole bottle of wine.
                  Am I not right?"
               "I am sure I do not know, I have never tried the experiment."
               "You will have a chance to try this evening, or I'm mistaken, for the spirits of
                  the sisters I have just alluded to, are certainly rising fast. The reason of this
                  happy change, have now not the least doubt is to be found in the fact that they
                  have learned that no wine is to be served to-night night. You cannot tell, Mr.
                  Mudie, how pleased I feel about this, now that its necessary happy results become
                  apparent to my mind."
               "I must say, that, like you, I feel pleasure at the thought that two such amiable
                  beings are made happy. Most willingly will I give up the wine for their sakes. But
                  what could have induced our friend Somers to take such a position, involving
                  himself, as he most certainly will, in ridicule?"
               "Principle, I suppose. He has no doubt been made to feel sensibly the evil of
                  introducing intoxicating drinks in companies where there may be some who will be
                  tempted to use it immoderately."
               "He is, certainly a bold man to take such a stand."
               "He is, I believe, an independent man—that is, a man, who, when he is once
                  convinced that a certain course of action is right, will pursue it steadily and
                  fearlessly. I wish there were more such."
               "Will Miss Whiteman favour us with a song?" said Mr. Lewis, the bride's father,
                  about half an hour after, to Eleanor.
               "With pleasure," that young lady replied, with one of her happiest smiles, for her
                  heart felt as light as a feather There had been no wine yet.
               Handed up to the piano by Mr. Lewis, she took her seat there, and after turning
                  over a few music leaves, selected a piece that her eye lit upon unexpectedly. Then
                  running her fingers over the keys of the instrument, for a few moments, she
                  commenced in a clear, musical voice, and with much expression, the song— 
                     
                        "Water for me, bright water for me,
                        And wine for the tremulous debauchee."
                     
                  
               
               Its effect upon the company was almost electrical, exhilarating their feelings,
                  and putting each one in the best possible humour with himself, and all around him.
                  Its repetition was called for, when it was sung with renewed spirit.
               You seem quite happy to-night, Eleanor," remarked a lady who sat by her side, some
                  ten minutes after, while each held in her hand a saucer of strawberries and
                  cream.
               
               "And I do feel happy," was the reply. "This is one of the most pleasant parties I
                  have attended for a long time. Every one is so full of life and true
                  enjoyment."
               "So it appears to me. And I have already been wondering to myself about the
                  reason. We have all met in company, frequently, but never before, it seems to me,
                  in such excellent spirits. I really believe, Eleanor, that it is, because you and
                  Adeline are so full of life and enjoyment."
               "O, no. That is a mere idea of your own."
               "It may be. But so I have thought."
               "Will you dance, Miss Whiteman?" young Mudie said, coming up at that moment, and
                  offering his arm.
               "With pleasure," was Eleanor's response, and the two passed to the centre of the
                  room, to take their places in a cotillion. Mr. Lee, the friend of Mudie, came up
                  with Adeline at the same moment, making the set complete. The two girls were in
                  fine spirits, and danced with exquisite grace. Their partners were never before so
                  struck with their loveliness.
               Thus the festivities of the evening progressed, and continued with an
                  uninterrupted flow of spirits. It was a feast of reason, and a flow of soul;
                  rather than a flow of wine without reason.
               "I don't know when I have enjoyed myself better," was the remark of almost every
                  one, the brother of Adeline and Eleanor among the rest.
               "Well, Mr. Mudie, how do you feel now?" asked the lady with whom he had been
                  conversing during the early part of the evening.
               "Very pleasant, indeed," was the reply.
               "You didn't need wine to keep up, I believe."
               "No, indeed, I have scarcely thought of wine since."
               "And yet, I have rarely seen you in better spirits."
               "It was because I had such a pleasant companion during a great part of the
                  time."
               "Eleanor Whiteman?"
               "Yes."
               "You know the reason—at least, the presumed one—why, she has been in such good
                  spirits?"
               "O, yes. And I am so glad there has been no wine; and I hope I may never see
                  another drop at a party, as long as I live."
               "Really, you have become quite a convert to the cold-water system!"
               "How could I help it, when it has worked to-night so admirably? Did you observe
                  Mr. Morven, how much he seemed to enjoy himself?"
               "I did. And his wife too. How cruel it would have been, had they placed, as some
                  of our temperance folks say, a devil to his lips, to steal away his brains?"
               "It certainly would. For months he has been trying to reform himself, and has not,
                  in that time, tasted a drop of wine or spirits. It would be extremely dangerous
                  for him to do so. He has, on this account, declined, of late, attending parties;
                  for he dislikes to refuse wine, because it attracts attention to him, and reminds
                  the company of his weakness. Being related to Henry Somers, he could not stay away
                  to-night. How distressed his poor wife must have felt, in anticipation of the
                  danger that would be run!"
               "I have no doubt of it. Indeed, I could not help noticing that she had an unquiet
                  look during the first part of the evening, all of which soon passed away, and she
                  enjoyed herself very much. What you have just said, gives me a clue to explain
                  something that you could not understand."
               "What was that?"
               "The reason why Mr. Somers would not consent to have any wine at his wedding."
               "True—true. I see what you are going to say. It was, no doubt, on his relative's
                  account."
               "No doubt. And I only wish every one else was as considerate of others. If they
                  were, there would be very little wine served round to promiscuous companies, I am
                  very certain; for there are but few assemblages now, where there may not be some
                  one to whom it would be a temptation—some reformed inebriate, who might fall away,
                  and never after be reclaimed."
               "That consideration is certainly a very serious and important one, and, it now
                  seems to me, should never be lost sight of," was Mr. Mudie's reply.
               
               "You seemed very much pleased, last evening," Adeline Whiteman said to her
                  brother, as they sat alone upon the sofa, on the next morning.
               "I certainly was, sister—more than I have been for long time. And you, too, were
                  brighter and happier than usual. I heard several remark that both you and Eleanor
                  were the very life of the company. How is this? You have been particularly dull in
                  society, of late?"
               "Have I?" Adeline replied, her manner becoming at once embarrassed.
               "You certainly have. But why do you colour and look confused, sister?"
               "You say that you enjoyed yourself very much, last night, Edward?" his sister
                  resumed, after a few moments laying her hand upon his arm, and looking him
                  earnestly in the face.
               "I certainly did, Adeline."
               "And yet there was no wine there, brother," she added, still gazing into his
                  face.
               "What do you mean, Adeline!" was his instant response, somewhat sternly made.
               "I only said that there was no wine there—no artificial excitement."
               "But why did you say it to me?" in a severe tone.
               "Do not be angry, Edward, with a sister who loves you tenderly, and whose very
                  love makes her perception of danger tenfold more acute."
               "You speak in riddles, Adeline! Come at once, and distinctly to the point. Of what
                  danger do you speak?"
               "Of the danger that lies in the wine cup, Edward. You may be unconscious of it,
                  but I have too frequently seen you under its influence in company, not to fear and
                  tremble for you."
               Half conscious of his own weakness, yet fully assured that no one had a suspicion
                  that he was in danger, Edward Whiteman was taken by surprise at this. Both
                  irritated and mortified, he did not know what reply to make. He felt angry with
                  Adeline, because she had perceived, what he supposed no one suspected; and was
                  yet, at the same time, conscious that he had no right to be angry with his sister,
                  but with himself. He, therefore, would not trust himself to speak, but sat for a
                  few moments in agitated irresolution, and then suddenly rose up and left the room,
                  and the house.
               Poor Adeline was, of course, exceedingly distressed at this. The effect upon her
                  brother's mind, of what she had said, she could not, of course, truly imagine. But
                  her busy fears suggested the worst and most painful result. He was, evidently,
                  angry at what she had said, and a brother's anger she felt it to be hard to
                  bear,—still harder to bear, was the thought that she had, by her imprudence,
                  driven him, in all probability, to speedy ruin.
               "What troubles you now, Adeline?" her mother asked, coming into the room where she
                  still sat, and finding her in tears.
               "I have been talking to Edward, ma; and he has got angry and left the house," was
                  her reply.
               "What were you talking to him about?"
               "I am afraid you will all blame me, but I did it for the best. You know that I
                  have several times mentioned to you, that at parties he often drinks too much
                  wine, so as to make himself the subject of remark, and that we have all felt
                  troubled about him on this account."
               "Well?"
               "I hinted, distantly, at this, just now, when he insisted on my speaking out
                  plainly;—I did so, gently warning him, that he was in danger."
               "And he got angry?"
               "Yes, and left the house without making any reply, from which I could gather his
                  true feelings."
               "This is what troubles you?"
               "O, yes, ma, I feel deeply distressed about it. I had only his good in view; but I
                  tremble lest my well-meant effort will be productive of harm. What, if he should
                  suddenly throw himself away!" and a new gush of tears attested the agitation of
                  her feelings.
               "Do not give yourself unnecessary pain, Adeline," her mother said, in an
                  encouraging tone. "No harm, be assured, will grow out of what you have said. All
                  of us, instead of blaming, must feel greatly obliged to you for relieving us of a
                  very unpleasant duty, that should have been performed months ago."
               "Are you then, satisfied, that no harm to Edward, will grow out of what I have said?" Adeline asked, in a
                  calmer tone.
               "I apprehend no danger at all," was the mother's reply.
               "I think that I understand Edward's character well enough to be assured that he
                  will not only thank you for warning him of danger, but will flee from it in future
                  His feelings are easily roused, but when they subside, h reasons calmly, and is
                  fixed in his resolutions."
               "How greatly you have relieved my heart," the daughter said. "Still, I shall be
                  very unhappy, until he returns, and we are reconciled."
               It was about three hours after, that a gentle rap at Adeline's chamber-door,
                  roused her from a deep and troubled reverie. As she opened it, a low, and somewhat
                  sad voice, asked,
               "Are you alone, sister?"
               "Yes, Edward, come in," she replied, quickly, and her brother entered, and closed
                  the door quietly, after him. Kissing the cheek of his sister, that was paler than
                  usual, he said, as he drew his arm affectionately around her waist—
               "I want to talk with you for a little while, Adeline."
               "I will hear you with pleasure, Edward. But first, do you forgive me for what I
                  said this morning?"
               "Forgive you, Adeline! O, yes, and thank you a thousand times! It is upon that
                  subject that I wish to converse with you."
               A momentary silence passed, and then the young man resumed—
               "For some months past, I have noticed, and so have others, that neither you nor
                  Eleanor were so cheerful in company as formerly. May I ask the reason?"
               "As you expect, and I can only give a true reason, Edward, I must answer, that it
                  was because we were troubled on your account."
               "Why, then, were you in so much better spirits last night?"
               "Because you drank no wine, there."
               "Then, was it simply my drinking of wine that troubled you?"
               "O, no, Edward, not that. It was the effect produced on you by the wine."
               "What was that effect? speak frankly."
               "The effect has been, at nearly every party, for the last six months, except the
                  one last night, that you have become elated and foolish, if I must so speak, to
                  such a degree, that you were noticed by the company. How, then, could we be
                  cheerful when such was your condition—or even while looking forward to it, at the
                  beginning of a social evening, with dread."
               For some time after Adeline ceased speaking, her brother sat in thoughtful
                  silence,—then he said—
               "Since your unexpected remark this morning, which half-offended, while it pained
                  me exceedingly, I have been endeavouring to recall the past with as much vividness
                  as possible. I had already become conscious of a growing fondness for wine, but
                  could not believe that this had been perceived by others, much less by yourself,
                  or any of the family. And yet, although I had noticed a change in you and Eleanor
                  for some time back when in company, I never could bring myself to inquire the
                  reason, for fear that it had something to do with this very weakness. What you
                  said this morning, satisfied me that my vague and scarcely acknowledged suspicions
                  were but too true. An hour's serious thought convinced me that I had but one safe
                  course to pursue. The reluctance with which I gained my own consent to adopt that
                  course, convinced me of my danger, and confirmed my resolution to adopt it. I have
                  determined, hereafter, to abstain totally, on all occasions, from the use of wine,
                  or strong drinks. This I am convinced is the only safe way for me."
               "O, brother! What a load you have removed from my heart!" Adeline said, leaning
                  her head upon his shoulder, while tears of joy fell slowly over her cheeks. "How
                  happy I shall be! And how happy we all shall be!"
               "And I, too, shall be far happier, and prepared to join in purer social delights,
                  than heretofore. I laughed, heartily, at the idea of Henry Somers's cold-water
                  wedding. But I shall never cease to remember it with pleasure, I tried hard, when
                  I learned, beforehand, his intention, to ridicule him out of the idea; but the
                  more I said, the more resolute he seemed to grow."
               "What reason did he give you?" Adeline asked.
               "None at all; although he said his reasons were so good that no argument, persuasion, or form of
                  ridicule, could change him."
               "Is it not a little strange, that Mr. Lewis acceded to his wishes?"
               "It is. But, then, Henry told him that if he were not willing to do so, he must
                  insist upon having no wedding party at all. Of the two dilemmas, Mr. Lewis chose
                  the former."
               "What do you think was his reason, Edward?"
               "I have no doubt that it was on Mr. Morven's account, and, perhaps, on my own,
                  also, as you say I have been too much excited of late in company. Of course, he
                  would not say so to me, but some such reason must have influenced him, I am sure,
                  for he is ever regardful of others in all he does."
               "We shall have to give a party to the bride," the sister remarked, after a brief
                  silence.
               "Of course," Edward responded.
               "A cold-water party?"
               "I dislike, above all things, to be singular, Adeline. Still, I should be in
                  favour of excluding everything stronger than lemonade. We have had a good example
                  set us, and have partaken largely of its benefits,—shall we not follow, and thus
                  dispense good to others?"
               "I have but one opinion, and one feeling in the matter, Edward, and they are
                  altogether in favour of excluding wine and brandy."
               "How will father and mother feel about it?"
               "They will warmly coincide with us, I know."
               "Then let it be a cold-water party."
               "With all my heart."
               "How much this party reminds me of the wedding party," remarked Mr. Mudie, to
                  Mrs.—, on the evening when company assembled at Mr. Whiteman's, in honour of the
                  new-married couple.
               "In what respect?" asked Mrs.—.
               "O, in the life and enjoyment that pervade the whole company. There is a sphere of
                  rational and confidential social intercourse prevailing here to an extent not
                  always experienced."
               "I have felt the same at other parties."
               "So have I. But it is rarely that we find all in so large an assemblage as this,
                  ready to enter into the general joy. Upon some heart will rest a burden, and upon
                  some countenance a shadow of gloom."
               "These, however, will be dissipated to a great extent by the light and joy that is
                  diffused around, if there be not some present cause of pain or uneasiness."
               "No such cause should be permitted to exist in a social
                  party."
               "So think I. Now, it is because all causes that could possibly affect unpleasantly
                  any one invited to this party, have been removed by those who have given it, that
                  all seem to be so happy."
               "How has this been done?" asked the young man.
               "Particularly in the exclusion of everything that could intoxicate. This, you are
                  aware, I suppose, is a cold-water party."
               "Sure enough! There has been no wine served. Really, I had not observed it!"
               "Then I presume you have not felt the need of it to get up a social feeling within
                  your own bosom?"
               "O, no, indeed! Every one is so full of enjoyment—every one so social, that I have
                  become at once affected by the general delight."
               "Do you think if wine had been circulated, that Eleanor Whiteman whom I saw
                  leaning upon your arm a few minutes ago, the personification of beauty and
                  joyousness, would have been so happy as she is?"
               "O, no. I am sure she would not."
               "The heat, and warmth of social life, transfused around, and felt by all who
                  approach one like her, must give a thousand times purer and freer spirit of social
                  intercourse, than all the wine that ever was or ever will be served. There is
                  nothing, Mr. Mudie, like the wine of a happy spirit, to exhilarate a company."
               "I feel sensibly the force of your remark," the young man replied. "I have
                  attended many, very many parties in my time, where wine has been poured out like
                  water, and I have taken wine freely at these assemblages with the rest; but never,
                  I am sure, have I enjoyed myself so much as I have to-night. I have seen more
                  boisterous mirth—more excess of joyfulness, but nothing of the pure delight, freely and fully expressed, that I
                  have seen here."
               "There is, trust me, my young friend, a very great difference in purely rational
                  pleasure, called into activity by warm social affections, and that species of
                  insane enjoyment which depends upon artificial excitement."
               "I believe you are perfectly right, Mrs.—. Facts have already proved to me the
                  truth of the position you took at the wedding. But, tell me as a friend, and in
                  confidence, whether—But stay, can I confide in you? And are you willing to be my
                  adviser?"
               "You may confide in me as a friend, Mr. Mudie—and as far as I am capable of
                  advising you, I will do so with pleasure."
               "Thank you, with all my heart. And now, to begin—Do you know whether Eleanor is
                  engaged?"
               "I believe she is not. But why?"
               "Would it be hard for you to guess?" Mudie asked with a meaning look.
               "Perhaps not. But I like every one to tell plainly and honestly his own story, and
                  then I shall be sure not to misunderstand dark allusions. So speak out
                  plainly."
               "I will."
               "Then I shall know what to say."
               "At Henry Somers's wedding, I saw her in a new light. Before, there had been about
                  her a distance, a seeming coldness, and a reserve, that chilled me, and kept me at
                  a distance. But on that evening, she seemed so suddenly changed into a joyous
                  creature—became suddenly so frank, so cheerful, so full of spirit and beauty, that
                  my heart was drawn towards her irresistibly. To-night, she is even more
                  enchanting. See, now, with what exquisite grace she moves through that cotillion!
                  Did you ever see a sweeter, or happier countenance?"
               "I fully appreciate all you say, Mr. Mudie. There are few sweeter girls than
                  Eleanor and her sister Adeline."
               "Of that, I am now fully persuaded. And you believe that her
                  affections are not interested?"
               "I have reason to believe they are not."
               "Do you think I might venture to address her?"
               "Ah, now you are coming to the point."
               "Well. Now I have come to the point frankly, I hope you will give me a frank
                  answer."
               "Certainly I will. You might venture to address her if you were to do one
                  thing."
               "What is that?"
               "If you were to join the temperance society," Mrs.—replied, smiling.
               "You are sporting with me, while I am serious," the young man said, somewhat
                  gravely.
               "Not so much as you might, perhaps, think, Mr. Mudie. Certain I am, that if
                  Eleanor Whiteman were to see you drink wine at a party, or any other liquor, that
                  would intoxicate, all hope for you, in that quarter, would be cut off."
               "That would be arbitrary and unreasonable."
               "Not so much so, as at the first impression you might be inclined to think. The
                  dangerous position in which she has perceived her own brother to be placed, a
                  brother whom she has loved, and in whom, no doubt, she has reposed great
                  confidence, will naturally direct her attention to the same habit in others, that
                  has overcome him. The consequence will be, a natural unwillingness to permit her
                  affections to go out towards a young man whom she sees inclined to drink. Though
                  she may respect, and esteem, nay, love him, she will hardly consent to bestow her
                  hand upon him, while the example of her own brother is before her eyes. That which
                  in a brother is so distressing, must be ten times more so in a husband."
               "But, Mrs.—, I do not drink to excess, as her brother too frequently does."
               "If I, Mr. Mudie, as I told you on a former occasion, could note a very apparent
                  effect of wine upon you, even while in the company of ladies; would not her quick
                  perceptions, rendered, as they must be, painfully acute, detect it much more
                  readily, if she felt a personal interest in you? Certainly they would! You cannot,
                  then, blame her. If she objected to you, because you used wine and strong drinks,
                  habitually, there would be, in her objection, as I see it, nothing arbitrary or
                  unreasonable."
               "Perhaps not," the young man said, musingly.
               "But do you think no other serious objection would exist?" he asked, after a few
                  moments' silence.
               
               "I cannot say positively, of course."
               "O, no, of course not. But then, as far as you are able to judge, can you
                  encourage me to make advances."
               "I certainly can. And what is more, know of no young man more likely to
                  succeed."
               "Then I must make the trial, for I believe she has made quite a serious impression
                  on my heart."
               "Remember the cold-water, though," Mrs.—said, with an arch smile.
               "O, yes. I'll remember," was the reply.
               "You look serious, Mr. Mudie," Adeline remarked, as, leaning upon the arm of his
                  friend, Mr. Lee, she paused before the young man.
               "Do I, indeed! Well, that ought not to be, when you and your sister, and all your
                  company, are so happy."
               "A very wise remark," was the laughing reply. "But where is Eleanor? I must send
                  her to bring back your fugitive spirits. She has life enough in her this evening
                  for two or three. O, here she is!"—as Eleanor came up at the moment—"Come,
                  sis'!—Here is Mr. Mudie, looking quite sombre. That will never do. Can't you
                  impart to him a portion of your own joyous feelings?"
               As Eleanor approached, while her sister was speaking, her cheeks glowing, and her
                  eyes dancing in light, she appeared to young Mudie the loveliest being he had ever
                  looked upon. The deepening blush that overspread her face at Adeline's playful
                  remark, was observed, and made his bosom thrill with deeper emotion than had yet
                  trembled over the chords of affection.
               A momentary and slight embarrassment was experienced by both Mudie and Eleanor;
                  but it quickly subsided, and he offered her his arm with a playful word in reply
                  to what Adeline had said. They were soon lost to observation in the crowd.
               "Henry Somers's will not be the last cold-water wedding, I am inclined to think,"
                  Mrs.—remarked, with a smile, to a lady near her, as the young couple mingled with
                  their gay companions in the promenade.
               She was right. About six months after, the large parlours of Mr. Whiteman were
                  crowded with a brilliant liant company, the central point of attraction in which
                  were three lovely brides. Adeline and Eleanor, looking happier and more beautiful
                  than ever, and also cousin Mary, mentioned far back, as having had all her
                  pleasure spoiled at Mrs. Wheeler's party, by the conduct of Edward. Adeline had
                  become the wife of Mr. Lee, Eleanor of Mr. Mudie, and cousin Mary had yielded up
                  her heart with joy to Edward Whiteman. It was, too, another cold-water wedding;
                  and there was not one present who would have tasted wine had it been offered.
               A few days afterwards, Mr. Mudie met Henry Somers.
               "I must again offer you my congratulations, Mudie," the latter said, smiling and
                  grasping his hand.
               "And I must take this opportunity to thank you for the sweet wife I have
                  obtained."
               "Thank me!" Somers said, in surprise.
               "Yes, you. You remember your cold-water wedding?"
               "O, yes," the other replied, laughing.
               "Well, it was because you had resolution enough to act right on that occasion,
                  that I must thank you for my wife."
               "How so?"
               "I had met her frequently before, but was not attracted. She seemed cold and
                  spiritless. But on that evening, she was remarkably changed. It seemed as if a ray
                  of spiritual sunshine had suddenly gleamed upon her mind. I was at once
                  interested, and that interest soon grew into affection. The cause of so remarkable
                  a change was this. Edward had begun to give way under the encroachments of a love
                  of drink, and at every social party that he attended with them, indulged too
                  freely. The consequence was, that they perceived it; and, therefore, their spirits
                  were always depressed on such occasions. But at your wedding, there was no wine,
                  and their spirits instantly rose under the influence of the happy sphere around
                  them. I then saw Eleanor as she really was, and loved her. And this is not all.
                  Adeline attracted our friend Lee's attention on that same night. Nor is this
                  all—Edward Whiteman was led by some remarks of his sister in reference to the
                  wedding, to see his true condition, and
                  utterly to renounce all intoxicating drinks as a beverage. He then had power to
                  win the heart of dear little cousin Mary—or rather, was now able to obtain the
                  heart already his own. It will be long, very long, Harry, before any of us forget
                  your cold-water wedding."
            
            
               
               
                  
                     Two Scenes in the Life of a City Belle.
                  
               
               TWO SCENES IN THE LIFE OF A CITY BELLE.
               
                  SCENE FIRST.
                  "ISN'T she a glorious creature?" said my young friend Merwyn, glancing, as he
                     spoke, toward a beautiful girl named Florine Malcolm, the daughter of a
                     merchant reputed to be rich. We were at a party, and the object of remark sat,
                     or rather reclined near us on a sofa, with a graceful abandon, or rather
                     indolence, in her whole air and attitude, that indicated one born and raised in
                     idleness and luxury.
                  "She is a fine looking girl, certainly," I replied.
                  "Fine looking!" said my enthusiastic young friend, in surprise, half inclined
                     to be offended at the coldness with which I expressed myself. "Fine looking,
                     indeed! She's a perfect Hebe; a very impersonation of youth and beauty."
                  "No one can deny that she is a very lovely and beautiful girl," said I, to
                     this. "But she lacks animation."
                  "What you speak of as a fault, I consider her greatest charm. I never met any
                     one so free from all vulgar hurry and excitement. An exquisite ease
                     distinguishes her actions, and she reminds you, in nearly every thing, of those
                     courtly ladies who give such a charm to foreign aristocratic society.
                     Certainly, I have not met, in this country, with any one who has so perfectly
                     the air of a high-bred lady as Florine Malcolm."
                  To understand this, perfectly, the reader must be told that Merwyn had recently
                     returned from a tour through Europe, whither he had been permitted to go by a
                        wealthy father, and where he had
                     discovered, like most of our young men who venture abroad, that in our forms of
                     social intercourse, and in all that gives fashionable society its true
                     excellence and attractiveness, we are sadly deficient. Foreign manners, habits,
                     and dress were brought home and retained by the young man; who, as a natural
                     consequence, became a favourite among our ladies, and was thus encouraged in
                     his silly imitations of things anti-American, and therefore in America
                     ridiculous. In the eye of sober-minded, sensible people, who did not know him
                     well enough to see that there was a more substantial groundwork in his
                     character than all this would lead a casual observer to infer, Merwyn was
                     viewed as a mere fop, whose brains had grown out upon his upper lip in the
                     shape of a moustache.
                  Such a man was my friend, Henry Merwyn. I knew his better qualities, and
                     esteemed them; at the same time that I saw his weaknesses, and bore with them
                     for the sake of the good that was in him. He had been raised in a sickly
                     atmosphere, and his mind had taken an unhealthy tone; but he was honourable,
                     and rigidly just in all his actions toward others.
                  As for the young lady he so warmly admired—Miss Florine Malcolm—I only knew her
                     as we know those into whose society we are but occasionally thrown. She was a
                     fine, showy girl, with a face of more than ordinary beauty; but, to one of my
                     taste, uninteresting for the very reason that she proved so charming to Merwyn.
                     This genteel languor, this elegant indolence, this distinguishing repose, never
                     much suited my fancy: I like to see the soul flow into the bodily organism, and
                     thrill its every nerve with life and sentiment. I like to see the eye burn, the
                     lips quiver, and the whole face glow with animating thought. These make beauty
                     tenfold more beautiful; and give to even plainness a charm.
                  "By a high-bred lady," I replied to Merwyn's particular praise of Miss Malcolm,
                     "you mean, I presume, a woman who is entirely artificial."
                  "No," he quickly answered, "you put a construction on my words that I do not
                     acknowledge to be fair. By a high-bred lady, I mean one who possesses that
                     peculiar ease and grace, that exquisite repose, and that charming elegance of
                     manner that comes from a refined taste and long association with those who move
                     in the highest rank in society. In fact, it is hard to fix in words all that
                     goes to make up a well-bred lady; but, when you meet her, you know her at a
                     glance."
                  "And you say Miss Malcolm comes nearer to the high-bred, courtly lady, than any
                     woman it has been your fortune to meet on this side of the Atlantic?"
                  "She does. In Paris or London she would find herself at home in the first
                     circles of fashion. Now just look at Miss Watson, who sits near her, bolt
                     upright, and stiff as a post; and then observe how gracefully Florine reclines
                     on those cushions like a very queen. There you have the exact difference
                     between a mere vulgar girl and a true lady."
                  There was a difference between the two individuals thus referred to—a very
                     marked difference. Miss Watson looked like a girl of thought and action, while
                     the other reposed languidly among the cushions of a sofa, the very picture of
                     indolence.
                  "I see nothing vulgar about Miss Watson," said I. "And I know that there is
                     nothing vulgar about her. She is a true lady in every sense of the word."
                  Merwyn half vexed me by his dissenting silence.
                  Just then he observed that Miss Malcolm looked pale. Going over quickly to
                     where she was, he inquired if she were not well, and learned that some
                     particular perfume used by a lady who sat near, was so unpleasant as to make
                     her faint. He immediately proposed that she should go into another room where
                     were fewer persons, and get a place near one of the windows, offering his arm
                     at the same time. She arose, and I saw her pass out slowly. She was in good
                     health, in fact, in the very prime and vigour of young life; yet, surrounded as
                     she was by every luxury and elegance, she had grown inactive, and felt even a
                     small effort as burdensome. Trifling causes affected her; and she imagined a
                     physical inability to do a thousand things that might have been done with
                     scarce an effort.
                  The very sympathy and concern manifested by Merwyn, who was the lover of Florine, made her feel that
                     she was really indisposed; and she languidly reclined on the sofa to which he
                     had conducted her, with the air of an invalid. Finding that she did not grow
                     any better, Merwyn, in a little while, proposed that she should go home, and
                     had a carriage ordered. Wandering into the apartment to which they had gone, I
                     saw him bring her shawl, without which she could not pass into the
                     dressing-room for fear of cold, and saw her meet the attention with a half
                     averted face, and a want of effort, that made me feel as if I would like to
                     have aroused her by means of the wires from an electrical battery.
                  "A beautiful couple they will make," said I to myself, as Florine arose and
                     went out, leaning heavily on the arm of the young man, "to pass through the
                     storms and over the rough places of this troublesome world. A summer breeze
                     will be too rough for that young creature, and the odour of violets too
                     stimulating for her nerves."
                  A few months subsequent to this they were married, and not long afterward I
                     removed from the city, and did not see them again for some years. But, I
                     learned, in the mean time, with sincere regret, that in a great "commercial
                     crisis" through which the country passed, both of the families of this young
                     couple had been reduced from affluence to comparative poverty. A sigh for the
                     human summer flowers I have mentioned, was my simple response to the news. A
                     couple of years afterward I met them again.
               
               
                  SCENE SECOND.
                  During a journey through the western part of Ohio, I had occasion to stop for a
                     few days in the little town of R—. On the day after my arrival, a man whose
                     face struck me as being familiar, passed the door of the tavern in which I was
                     standing. A sort of doubtful recognition took place on both sides, but neither
                     of us being certain as to the other's identity, we did not speak, and the man
                     passed on. I looked after him as he moved down the street, wondering in my mind
                     who he could be, when I saw him stop, and after appearing to hesitate about
                     something, turn around and walk back toward the hotel. He was a young man,
                     plainly dressed, and looked as if he were clerk in a store, or, it might be, a
                     small store-keeper himself. As he came back, I fixed my eyes upon his face,
                     trying to make out who it was that bore such familiar features.
                  "My old friend Merwyn!" I exclaimed, as he paused in front of where I
                     stood.
                  He called my name in return, and then we grasped each other's hands
                     eagerly.
                  "The last man in the world I expected to meet," said I.
                  "And, certainly, I as little expected to meet you," was returned. "This is
                     indeed a pleasure! When did you arrive, and how long do you stay in R—?"
                  "I came here yesterday, and hope to resume my journey to-morrow."
                  "Not so soon!" Merwyn said, still tightly holding my hand. "You must stay
                     longer."
                  "I am doubtful as to that," I returned. "But is this your place of sojourn in
                     the world?"
                  "Yes, for the present, seeing that I can't find a better."
                  There was a manly cheerfulness in the way this was said, which I could not have
                     believed it possible for the young man to feel, under the great change of
                     circumstances that had taken place.
                  "And your lady?" I felt some hesitation even while I asked this question.
                  "Very well, thank you!" was cheerfully replied. "We live a mile or two from
                     town, and you must go out and spend a night with us before you leave. Florine
                     will be delighted to see you."
                  "It will be quite as pleasant for me to meet her," I could but answer; yet even
                     while I spoke I felt that our meeting must remind the wife of my friend so
                     strongly of the past, as to make it any thing but pleasant.
                  "How long have you lived here?"
                  "About two years."
                  "It is almost the last place in which I expected to meet you. What are you
                     doing?"
                  "Merchandizing in a small way. I had no profession, when kind fortune knocked
                     us all on the head, and so had to turn my hand to the first thing that offered,
                     which happened pened to be a
                     clerkship in a store at three hundred and fifty dollars a year. This was barely
                     enough to keep body and soul together; yet I was thankful for so much, and
                     tried to keep down a murmuring spirit. At the end of a year, having given every
                     satisfaction to my employer, he said to me one day—'You have shown far more
                     business capacity than I thought you possessed, and, I think, are the very man
                     I want to go out West with a stock of goods. Can you command any capital?' 'Not
                     a dollar, I fear,' was my reply. 'I'm sorry for that,' said he, 'for I want a
                     man who is able to take an interest in the business. Don't you think you could
                     raise a couple of thousand dollars in cash?' I shook my head doubtfully. We had
                     a good deal more conversation on the subject.
                  "When I went home, I mentioned to my wife what Mr. L—, my employer, had said,
                     and we talked much about the proposition. I expressed a great deal of regret at
                     not being able to furnish capital, as the offer I had received was plainly an
                     advantageous one, and would give me a fair start in the world. 'Would you be
                     willing to go off to the West?' I asked of Florine, while we talked over the
                     subject. 'Wherever you think it best to go, I will go cheerfully,' was her
                     brave answer. Thus far she had borne our change of fortune with a kind of
                     heroism that more than any thing else helped to sustain me. We were living with
                     my family, and had one child. My father, of whose misfortunes you are aware,
                     had obtained the office of president in an insurance company, with a salary of
                     two thousand a year, and this enabled him still to keep his family around him,
                     and, though luxuries had to be given up, his income afforded every comfort. We
                     had a room with them, and, though my income was small, we had all that health
                     and peace of mind required.
                  "On the day after the conversation with my wife about the West, she met me on
                     coming home to dinner, with so happy, yet meaning a smile on her face, that I
                     could not help inquiring what it meant. As I sat down by her side, she drew
                     from her pocket a small roll of bank bills, and, handing them to me,
                     said—'There is the capital you want.' I took the money, and unrolling it in
                     mute surprise, counted out the sum of two thousand dollars! 'Where did this
                     come from?' I inquired. She glanced across the room, and my eyes followed the
                     direction hers had taken. I missed something. It was her piano! 'Explain
                     yourself, Florine,' I said. 'That is easily done,' she replied, as she looked
                     tenderly in my face. 'I have sold my piano and watch, my diamond pin, bracelet
                     and ring, and every article of jewelry and bijouterie in my possession, but this,' holding up
                     the wedding ring, 'and there you have the money.' I cannot tell you how much I
                     was affected by this. But, no matter. I used the two thousand dollars in the
                     way proposed, and here I am. Come, walk down to my store with me, and let us
                     chat a little about old times, there."
                  I went, as invited, and found Merwyn with a small, but well selected stock of
                     goods in his store, and all the evidences of a thriving business around
                     him.
                  "You must go home with me this afternoon," said he, as I arose to leave him,
                     after having had an agreeable talk for an hour. "I live, as I told you, a short
                     distance in the country; so you will stay all night, and can come in with me in
                     the morning. The stage leaves here at five o'clock, and passes within a short
                     distance of my house. Florine will be delighted to see you."
                  I consented, well pleased with this arrangement, and, at five o'clock was
                     seated in the stage by the side of my old friend, who bore as little
                     resemblance to one of your curled, perfumed, and moustached exquisites—what he
                     had once been—as could well be imagined. His appearance was plain, substantial,
                     and business-like.
                  Half an hour's ride brought us to our stopping-place.
                  "I live off to the right here," said Merwyn, as we left the stage, "beyond that
                     piece of wood. Ten minutes' walk will bring us to my door. We prefer the
                     country for several reasons, the principal one of which is economy. Our
                     cottage, with six acres of ground, costs us only fifty dollars a year, and we
                     have the whole of the land worked on shares by a neighbour; thus more than
                     clearing our rent. Then we have plenty of fruit and milk for ourselves and
                     children, and fresh air and health into the bargain."
                  "But don't Mrs. Merwyn find it very lonesome out here?" I inquired.
                  
                  "Oh, no. We have two children, and they, with a very clever young woman who
                     lives with us more as a friend than a domestic, although we pay her wages, give
                     Florine plenty of society through the day, and I come in by night-fall, and
                     sometimes earlier, to make the evenings all she could wish. At least, I have
                     Florine's own declaration for this." The last sentence was uttered with a
                     smile.
                  As we walked along, the nearness of my meeting with Mrs. Merwyn turned my
                     thoughts back to other times. A beautiful girl was before me, languidly
                     reclining on a sofa, overcome by the extract of some sweet herbs, the perfume
                     of which had fallen unharmoniously upon the sense. A hot-house plant, how was
                     it possible that she could bear the cold, bracing atmosphere of such a life as
                     that she was now living? When last I saw her, she was but a tender summer
                     flower, on whom the warm sun shone daily, and into whose bosom the night dews
                     came softly with refreshing coolness.
                  Silently I walked along, with my mind full of such thoughts, when an opening in
                     the woods through which we were passing, gave me a glimpse of a woman's figure,
                     standing on the second rail of a fence, and apparently on the look-out for some
                     one. The intervening trees quickly hid her again from my view. In a minute or
                     so afterward we emerged from the trees but a short distance from the woman I
                     had seen, who was looking in another direction from that in which we were
                     coming. We were close upon her before she observed us. Then the voice of
                     Merwyn, who called "Florine!" startled her, and she turned upon us her
                     beautiful young face, glowing with health, surprise and pleasure. I paused in
                     astonishment. Was that the indolent, languid city belle, who could scarcely sit
                     erect even with the aid of cushions, now standing firm and straight on a
                     fence-rail, and looking more lovely and graceful than she had ever seemed in my
                     eyes?
                  She recognised me in a moment, and, springing from the rail, came bounding
                     toward me, full to overflowing of life and spirits. Grasping my hand, she
                     expressed the warmest pleasure at seeing an old face, and asked me a dozen
                     questions before I could answer one.
                  I found them occupying a neat little bird's-nest of a cottage, in which were
                     two as sweet little children as I have ever seen. While I sat and talked with
                     Merwyn, holding one child upon my knee, and he the other, Florine busied
                     herself in getting the supper. Her only domestic was away. Ever and anon I
                     caught a glimpse of her as she passed in and out of the adjoining room where
                     she had spread the table. A very long time did not elapse before I sat down
                     with my old friends to a meal that I enjoyed as well as any I have ever eaten.
                     The warm, white biscuits were baked by Florine; the sweet butter she had
                     herself churned, so she said, and the cakes and preserves were her own.
                  "I am surprised at all this," said I, after tea. "How is it possible for you to
                     be cheerful and happy under such a change? How was it possible for you to come
                     so efficiently into a mode of life, the very antipodes of the one to which you
                     were born, and in which you were educated?"
                  "Misfortune," replied Merwyn, "brings out whatever in efficient in our
                     characters. This has been particularly the case with us. We had both led
                     artificial lives, and had false views of almost every thing, when at a blow the
                     golden palace in which we had lived was dashed in pieces. We were then thrown
                     out into the world, with nothing to depend upon but our individual resources,
                     which were, at first, you may well believe, exceedingly small. The suddenness
                     with which our fashionable friends turned from us, and the entire exclusion
                     from fashionable society that followed, opened our eyes to the utter
                     worthlessness of much that we had looked upon as of primary consideration. The
                     necessity of our circumstances turned our thoughts, at the same time, to things
                     of real moment, the true importance of which grew daily more apparent. Thus we
                     were prepared for other steps that had to be taken, and which, I am glad to
                     say, we were able to take cheerfully. We now lead a true and useful life; and I
                     am sure Florine will join me in saying that it is a happier life than we ever
                     led before."
                  "Yes, with all my heart," replied the young wife. "I have good health, good
                     spirits, and a clear conscience; and without these no one can be happy."
                  "Still," remarked Merwyn, "we look to growing better off in the world, and hope, one day, to be
                     surrounded by at least a portion of the elegance and luxury of early times. But
                     until that day comes, we will enjoy the good things of life that fall to our
                     lot; and should it never come, we will have lost nothing by vain
                     anticipations."
                  When I parted with my old friends on the next day, I felt that their lot was,
                     beyond comparison, more blessed than it would have been had not misfortune
                     visited them; and wished, from my heart, that all who had met with similar
                     reverses would imitate their good example. Still, I wondered at the change I
                     had seen; and, at times, could hardly realize its truth.
               
            
            THE END.
