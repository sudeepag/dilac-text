            PREFACE.
            THE title of this book explains with sufficient clearness the important doctrine it
               is designed to teach. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap," is a truth
               that must be palpable to every one of sound mind; for an effect always bears in it
               the quality of its cause. If men's actions are governed by selfish and evil purposes,
               a re-action of evil will follow as certainly as like produces like. From this law of
               existence there is no escape; and, this being so, every wise man will take heed unto
               his ways.
            The illustrations of our subject presented in this volume, the ninth of the "LIBRARY
               FOR THE HOUSEHOLD," are not a tithe of what might be given. Enough is written,
               however, to make the truth we would teach so plain that even he who runneth may
               read.

            SEED-TIME AND HARVEST.
            
               ACTION AND REACTION.
               THERE is a law governing in the affairs of life, with its award of good or evil,
                  according to the tenor of every one's obedience or disregard thereto. Ignorance of
                  this law exempts no one from unhappy consequences; and yet at least four-fifths of
                  the human race appear to be utterly unconscious of its existence. The law is that
                  of action and reaction, which may thus be stated, in order to make it clearly
                  comprehensible.
               Every act of man's life, whether good or evil, has a reaction of consequence.
                  Whatever we do, affects others or ourselves in some way; for there cannot be such
                  a thing as an act without an effect proportionate to the action.
               This, upon a little reflection, will appear self-evident.
               
               The importance of a life in obedience to this law must strike every one at a
                  glance, for happiness or misery here and hereafter depends upon it. In great
                  things, so to speak, all see and acknowledge the existence of the law we have
                  stated; for examples of its unerring visitation are of daily occurrence. How sad
                  and various are the consequences that flow back upon men for evil actions! But in
                  little things, as they are called, where no violations of penal statutes or public
                  opinion take place, and where no reaction is apparent, we imagine that none will
                  ever come; that what they have done is but as in a void immense. This is a fatal
                  error. There is not an act of a man's life, little or great, good or bad, that
                  does not, sooner or later in life, react upon him with its full quota of
                  consequences. A philosopher has said that the stamp of a man's foot upon the earth
                  will shake the universe. The remark is more likely to be true than false. We can
                  believe it more easily than we can disbelieve it. And a single word, a look, or
                  smallest act of a man's life, forgotten by him in the next moment, may shake his
                  soul to the very centre.
               Alonzo Turnham had never heard of the existence of the law to which we have
                  alluded. But that was of little consequence. He would not have credited the fact,
                  if he had heard it stated. The law which he laid down for his government was, to
                  seek his own gratification in all possible ways that it could be done, without so
                  far trespassing upon the rights of others as to give them the power of
                  retaliation. At the age of twenty-one, he started in life with a determination to
                  succeed in the world. He saw that wealth gave the means of self-gratification to
                  almost any extent, and he resolved upon its attainment. He had been for two years
                  engaged in the study of law; but the law he perceived to be too slow a means of
                  attaining the object of his wishes, and he therefore began to look around him for
                  some quicker mode of advancement. He possessed some literary ability, and had
                  indulged an early passion for literary pursuits by writing for the columns of a
                  weekly newspaper. This made him, to some extent, acquainted with individuals
                  connected with the press. Conversing, one day, with the owner of a periodical, the
                  latter enumerated many instances of persons who had become wealthy in the
                  publishing business. Turnham caught at this, and pondered it in his mind. He had a
                  few thousand dollars, with which, after mature deliberation, he determined to
                  purchase a half-interest in a newly-started weekly paper, the projector of which
                  found himself in difficulties and compelled to take a partner.
               Upon this new pursuit in life, Turnham entered with great spirit. There was a
                  newspaper in the city, of the same class. It had been in existence for some years,
                  and was firmly established. Before coming
                  into the business himself, Mr. Turnham had been a regular subscriber for this
                  paper, and written for its columns. He had always liked it, and considered it a
                  very excellent publication. But now it wore an indifferent aspect in his eyes, and
                  he never took it up without a disparaging remark.
               "Isn't it astonishing," said he, to his partner in the business, one day, "that a
                  paper like this should have such a circulation? It isn't comparable with
                  ours."
               To this the partner readily assented.
               Turnham commenced reading the number of the paper upon which he had just
                  commented.
               "Just listen to this," said he, suddenly; and he read a few paragraphs. Then he
                  added, "What do you think of that?"
               "I shouldn't like to see that in our paper," the partner answered.
               "No; it's enough to kill any concern. I'm sure that no parent, who sees it and
                  reflects upon it, will allow another number of the paper to come into his house.
                  Very certain am I, that I would order a discontinuance instanter."
               "So would I," returned the agreeing partner.
               After sitting silent, with his eyes upon the floor, for some time, Turnham said,
                  speaking slowlyâ€”
               "It would be a capital move for us, just now, to take this matter up, and remark
                  with some severity upon it."
               "And get a storm about our ears for our pains."
               "There is nothing that I would like better. It would be the very thing for us. We
                  circulate six or seven thousand, and they twenty thousand. The controversy would
                  make us known to all their readers, and known as the advocates of religion and a
                  high morality. We should have the public all on our side. Without doubt, in three
                  months, their list will diminish at least five thousand, perhaps more, and ours
                  increase that number. It is a tide in our affairs, depend upon it, that we should
                  take at the flood. If you do not positively object, I will fire a Paixhan gun upon
                  them next week, and then prepare my batteries for a regular fight."
               "Just as you like," returned the pliant partner. "There is no doubt of its doing
                  us good."
               "None in the world. This false step of our neighbour is a lucky thing for us."
               In the hope of building up his own establishment by ruining his neighbour's,
                  Turnham opened upon the rival newspaper, with his Paixhan gun, as he called it,
                  and then waited anxiously for the return fire. A week then passed by, and, at
                  length, wet from the press, and, to his imagination, smoking with wrath, came the
                  paper he was so anxious to see. He opened it with eager hands, and, starting at
                  the first editorial column, ran his eyes over the whole inside page, in search of
                  the rejoinder he expected. But, to his mortification and disappointment ment, not the slightest allusion was
                  found to the violent attack he made. But, in his search, one paragraph, more
                  conspicuous than all the rest, attracted his attention. It was this:
               
                  "ENLARGEMENT.â€”The publishers of this paper have determined to enlarge and
                     greatly improve it. They have ordered an entire new font of type, and will add
                     a column to each page, and increase the length of the pages several inches, so
                     as to give at least a third more reading matter. Their large and rapidly
                     increasing subscription list enables them to do this. In advance of every other
                     paper in the country, it is their intention to keep in advance, spite of all
                     competition. To this they stand pledged to the public, and prepared to redeem
                     their pledge."
               
               Turnham read this over twice, and then laid aside the paper, in a very quiet and
                  deliberate manner. He had been completely outgeneraled; and he felt it. Instead of
                  breaking down his neighbour and building up himself, his movement was likely to
                  result in the establishment of his neighbour on a broader basis, and the complete
                  overshadowing of his own concern, that would be in danger of growing feeble for
                  want of sunshine. He took it for granted that the determination to enlarge and
                  improve was the mode taken to answer his attack; and he was right. It was the
                     reaction upon his selfish attempt to ruin a neighbour, in order to
                  build up himself.
               Ashamed, after having written so warmly against the rival establishment, and after
                  promising to refer to the subject again, to drop the matter, Turnham concocted a
                  still more bitter article, in the hope of provoking a reply. To this, he received
                  the effectual and silencing rejoinder of an enlargement and improvement. The
                  appearance of his neighbour, so superior to his own, completely disheartened
                  Turnham. It was plain, that unless a paper of equal pretensions were published, it
                  would be of no use to struggle for an existence. The list they had, by no means
                  justified increased expenses. The profits were yet only in prospect. But it became
                  a question between enlargement and abandonment, and they chose the former.
               Not six months had elapsed from the time Turnham entered the business of
                  newspaper-publishing, before he was heartily sick of it, and determined to sell
                  out his interest for the sum paid for it, which was three thousand dollarsâ€”more
                  than double what he now considered it worth. He had a young friend, just of age,
                  who had been smitten with a love of the muses, and who imagined himself to possess
                  literary 
                     abilties
                     abilities
                   of no common order. This person received, at his majority, some six or
                  seven thousand dollars, the income from which partly contributed to his support
                  while he prosecuted the study of law.
               Upon this young man, whose name was Wheeler, Turnham fixed as the scapegoat who
                  was to bear the evil of his false step.
                  For a month or two he managed, whenever he met him, to turn the conversation to
                  the subject of newspapers and periodicals, and the fortunes that were every day
                  made by publishers. His own fortune he considered as made, for the paper of which
                  he was part owner was increasing in patronage almost beyond precedent. He affirmed
                  that ten thousand dollars would not tempt him to sell his interest.
               In this way he kept the young man's thoughts in one channel, and filled him with a
                  desire to exchange the slowly-rewarded profession he had adopted for one that
                  promised such golden harvests. At length, he vaguely hinted that, if he were not
                  in so good a business, he would be tempted to join a friend in opening an office
                  as an exchange-broker. An allusion to this was more distinctly made soon
                  afterwardsâ€”so distinctly, that the friend could not help remarking thereon.
               Finally, by gradual approaches on the subject, and by a system of false
                  representations ingeniously made, Turnham created an eager desire in the mind of
                  Wheeler to buy out his half-interest in the paper, and actually to make a
                  proposition to that effect. This proposition was met by certain well-timed remarks
                  going to show his reluctance at giving up so certain a means of fortune. At last,
                  he agreed to take five thousand dollars for his part of the paper, which was paid
                  to him in cash.
               "A lucky escape!" he said to himself, when the bargain was complete; and so full
                  was he of self-congratulation at this fortunate turn of affairs, that he had not a
                  thought or feeling of sympathy for the friend he had deceived, and who lost every
                  dollar invested, and became involved in debt, by the breaking down of the
                  newspaper in a little over a year.
               Wheeler saw, after he had been in the establishment about a month, that he had not
                  been fairly dealt by; and he also saw that, unless the subscription-list of the
                  paper could be greatly increased, ruin was inevitable. He struggled hard to
                  overcome the difficulties of his position, but he struggled in vain. The
                  subscription increased but slowly, and the paper was published at a loss from the
                  day he bought it until it stopped for want of means to carry it on.
               But the young man, deeply as he felt the wrong he had sustained at the hands of
                  Turnham, never uttered a word on the subject to that individual, although his
                  manner towards him became reserved, and their intimate intercourse was not
                  continued; he set him down in his heart as a dishonest man, and determined to mark
                  him as such. After retiring from editorial life, Wheeler, who had been admitted to
                  the bar, entered upon the practice of his profession, determined to rest there all
                  his hopes of future success.
               In the mean time, Turnham had opened an exchange-office, and commenced operating
                  among a class of men quite as
                  sharp-witted and far more experienced than himself. His success, during the first
                  year or two, was by no means equal to his expectations; but after that, he
                  understood the operation of things better, and knew how to take advantage of the
                  almost hourly fluctuations created in the money-market by the eager spirit of
                  gain.
               At the age of twenty-five, Turnham began paying his addresses to a young lady who
                  was known as an heiress. Her parents were dead; but she lived with an aunt, for
                  whom she had a most tender regard, and in whose judgment she reposed great
                  confidence. It happened that Wheeler made the acquaintance of this aunt shortly
                  after Turnham commenced visiting the niece; and it also happened that, from some
                  allusions made to the young man, the aunt was led to ask Wheeler if he knew
                  him.
               "Yes, and to my sorrow," was the unhesitating answer.
               "Why do you say that?" asked the lady.
               "I was his friend and confided in his honour, and he deceived me," replied
                  Wheeler.
               Nothing more particular was alleged against Turnham, but this was enough. The lady
                  took the pains to ascertain that Wheeler was a man of truth and integrity, and
                  therefore believed what he said.
               When Turnham called next time upon the young heiress, with the intention of making
                  known his sentiments, he was told by her aunt that she did not wish to receive his
                  visits; and so all his present hopes of obtaining a fortune by marriage were
                  scattered to the winds. But he never dreamed that this was merely a
                     reaction upon his own conduct; nothing could have been farther
                  from his mind.
               In entering into the exchange business, Turnham had not contemplated a partnership
                  with a friend, as he stated to Wheeler; he had only said so in order to make up a
                  good story. He commenced business alone, upon the five thousand dollars he had
                  received for his paper, and continued it, with more or less success, for ten
                  years; during which time he had married a lady, older than himself by many years,
                  who was reputed to be worth fifty thousand dollars. The fortune turned out to be
                  only five thousand dollars, and this the lady had taken good care to have so
                  secured that he could not touch it. At the end of ten years, by a sudden change in
                  the stock-market, and the explosion of two or three fancy-stock concerns, Turnham
                  fell short thirty thousand dollarsâ€”more than all he had made. The extent of this
                  loss he concealed, and soon after he began to look around him for a partner with
                  capital. It was not long before he found a young man whose father was a wealthy
                  merchant, and inclined to furnish him with twenty thousand dollars, if he would
                  make a good connection with a well-established exchange-broker.
               This was just the thing for Turnham; and he so represented his business, and gave such good
                  references as to standing and capacity, that he succeeded in his wishes. A
                  copartnership was agreed upon. The terms of the connection being settled, they
                  were placed in the hands of a conveyancer, who was directed to prepare therefrom
                  articles of agreement. Before these were signed, the father, who was a prudent
                  man, submitted them to his lawyer, who happened to be Mr. Wheeler, now in a good
                  practice, and standing high at the bar as a man of talents and great probity.
               "Mr. Turnham, did you say it was?" remarked the lawyer, with an expression of
                  surprise, when the business was stated to him, and before he had looked at the
                  papers.
               "Yes, sir," returned the merchant, who was struck by the peculiar tone and manner
                  of Wheeler. "Do you know any thing against him?"
               "I should hardly like to see a friend of mine connected with him in business."
               "Why?"
               "Because, to speak freely, as I deem it my duty to do in the present instance, I
                  do not think him an honest man."
               "Not an honest man? You astonish me, Mr. Wheeler. What evidence have you of
                  this?"
               "I will plainly state to you the fact upon which my conclusion is based, and leave
                  you to make up your own mind on the subject. I have no wish to injure Mr. Turnham,
                  but I feel it to be my duty to warn the innocent, when I see them run into
                  danger."
               Wheeler then gave the merchant a plain history of his newspaper speculation, and
                  concluded by sayingâ€”"I have stated the circumstance as it occurred; you must make
                  up your own mind in regard to it."
               On the day that the merchant waited upon his lawyer with the articles of agreement
                  between Turnham and his son, the broker found himself exceedingly hard pressed. A
                  number of heavy drafts for funds in his hands belonging to his correspondents in
                  New York, Boston, and New Orleans, were presented, and had to be cashed; also
                  several notes given for stocks that were not now worth ten cents in the dollar. By
                  the most strenuous efforts, he succeeded in getting through, but he was fully
                  convinced that it would be impossible for him to stand for another day without
                  important aid. From nowhere could this come except through his new partner, whose
                  appearance, with the articles of agreement having his signature attached, he had
                  been looking for hourly; but, up to four o'clock, he had looked in vain. Fearing
                  that he might not come in before morning, and dreading the consequences of even an
                  hour's delay, he deemed it best to call around at the store of the young man's
                  father, and thus give matters a chance of coming to a close. If a good opportunity for doing so occurred, he meant
                  to ask to have a few thousand dollars advanced on the next day. In fact, the hope
                  of getting hold of the money was the only reason he had for venturing to press
                  matters to an earlier issue than they would come if left to themselves.
               Turnham found the merchant in his counting-room alone. His reception he thought
                  formal and even cold.
               "Is your son in?" he asked.
               "No, sir," was replied; and then there was silence.
               "Will he be in this afternoon?"
               "I think not."
               Turnham felt oppressed. There was something in the manner of the merchant that he
                  could not understand; a marked change, that was 
                     unacountable
                     unaccountable
                  . After sitting for a short time, Turnham arose and retired. The merchant
                  bowed to him low and formally as he did so.
               "Something is wrong," he muttered to himself, as he walked hurriedly back to his
                  office.
               The evening mail brought notice of drafts at sight, amounting to fifteen thousand
                  dollars, all, or nearly all of which would, probably, be presented next day. This
                  made ruin certain unless very important aid could be secured.
               The time until evening was spent in efforts to obtain money. He talked largely to
                  those upon whom he called, about the co-partnership he had formed, and the great
                  command of capital it would soon give him. All this was credited; but the parties
                  had not the money to spare from their own operations.
               "When is this connection to be formed?" asked one of the persons to whom he
                  applied.
               "Immediately," was answered. "The articles of agreement are drawn up, and nothing
                  now remains to sign but them. This would have been done today, only Mr. Hâ€”wanted
                  to submit them to his lawyer."
               "Who is his legal adviser? Do you know?
               "I do not."
               "Let me seeâ€”I did know. Yes, now I remember. It is Wheeler. He's a sound
                  lawyer."
               "Wheeler! are you sure?"
               "Oh, yes. I recollect now very well. Wheeler is the man."
               Turnham went back to his office, thinking more seriously about his conduct towards
                  Wheeler than he had ever thought before, and feeling anxious and alarmed lest the
                  lawyer should have retaliated upon him by informing Mr. Hâ€”of what he had done. The
                  effect, he saw, would be to ruin him.
               Turnham slept but a few hours that night. In the morning, he arose in a feverish
                  state of mind, but resolved upon one thing, and that was to see Mr. Hâ€”and his son
                  before nine oclock, and know whether the
                  articles of agreement were to be signed or not. Accordingly, he called upon the
                  merchant early. Mr. Hâ€”received him even more coldly than before, and the son
                  looked embarrassed and unhappy.
               "Have you had the papers examined?" the broker asked, coming at once to the
                  point.
               "We have," replied Mr. Hâ€”.
               "Are they properly drawn?" asked Turnham.
               "Yes; but since I saw you yesterday, circumstances have led me to change my views
                  in regard to my son. Of this I should have informed you during the day. I trust it
                  will be no matter of serious disappointment. A connection, fully as advantageous
                  as the one about being formed with my son, you can, without doubt, easily
                  make."
               "The reason of your extraordinary conduct," said Turnham, who had become quite
                  pale, "you will certainly explain."
               "I can make no explanation, sir," returned the merchant, coldly. "My reasons for
                  what I do are sufficient for my own justification. My conduct may appear
                  extraordinary in your eyes; but I am satisfied that, in reality, you have no right
                  to complain of it."
               This was all the satisfaction Turnham received. On that day, his acceptances were
                  dishonoured; and drafts to a large amount, drawn against deposits and collections
                  that ought to have been in his hands, went back unpaid.
               Ready as the broker would have been to secure something for himself in the
                  disaster that befell him, it came upon him so suddenly as to leave this out of his
                  power. Everything was swept from his hands, and he was compelled to begin again
                  with less than a hundred dollars in his pocket.
               For once he saw, as well as felt, the reaction of his own conduct, and was forced
                  to acknowledge that, in extricating himself from an early difficulty by improper
                  means, he had laid the foundation for ruin in after-life. Could he have seen
                  deeper into the relation existing between causes and effects, he would have
                  understood more fully the greater error he had committed, and trembled in fear of
                  even more reactive consequences. Doubtless they came.
               In illustration of the law stated at first, we have chosen a very plain and
                  familiar example. Hundreds of others might be given, taken from every grade, and
                  involving all social relations. The consequences of every one's conduct must be
                  felt in some form or other, earlier or later in life. This is inevitable, for
                  against all action must come reaction; and they will bear a due relation in
                  quality and force to each other,â€”a truth that we cannot lay too deeply to
                  heart.
            
            
               
               A LIFE LESSON.
               MR. PHILIP ELLIOTSON, a man in moderate circumstances, lived in a neat little
                  house, which he rented, in a thriving country village. He was keeping a store,
                  which yielded him a very comfortable living. As Mr. Elliotson's family increased,
                  the dwelling which he occupied became too small for him, making a removal or an
                  addition to the house necessary. Being a good tenant, and a man well thought of in
                  the community, his landlord was very ready to build him a couple of additional
                  rooms for an increase of rent equal to ten per cent. on the outlay.
               Mr. Gage, the carpenter, was employed to make the required improvements, and he
                  forthwith went to work. It was not long before a suitable frame was erected and
                  weather-boarded in, and the plasterer commenced upon the interior. On the morning
                  that the plasterer was to go to work, Mr. Elliotson, who was an early riser,
                  walked out into the yard to look around and see how the new building was
                  progressing. The first thing that met his eye was a load of lime that had been
                  thrown down close to the gate, where the plasterer had arranged his
                  mortar-troughs. It was in fine large lumps, fresh from the kiln.
               "Just the thing," said Mr. Elliotson, stooping down and turning over several large
                  pieces with his hand. "This will save me from buying lime."
               Mr. Elliotson then looked about him, and seeing that no one was near, stooped down
                  again, and selecting two of the largest lumps, took them up and carried them away,
                  remarking, in a low tone of voice to himself, as he did soâ€”"They will never be
                  missed."
               The lime was placed in an out-building, and an old piece of board thrown over it.
                  In a day or two afterwards, it was slacked and used in whitewashing the
                  fences.
               Now the taking of a couple of pieces of lime by Mr. Elliotson was a little matter,
                  comparatively speaking; but from small causes important results often come; and
                  they came in this instance. It happened that Mr. Gage, the carpenter, saw him take
                  the pieces of limeâ€”an act that surprised him very much. He could not have believed
                  Mr. Elliotson guilty of such a petty act of meanness, not to say dishonesty. Not
                  willing to condemn a man in his own mind, and especially a man held in such high
                  estimation by every one as was Mr. Elliotson, without being very sure that the
                  lime had been taken for his own private purposes, the carpenter, on coming to work that day, and after Mr. Elliotson
                  had gone to his store, searched about to see if he could find the lime. This
                  search discovered it concealed beneath an old board, where it had been placed.
               "I wouldn't have believed it, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes," said Gage,
                  quite confounded by what had occurred. "Some people might call this honest, but I
                  don't," he continued. "Why, it's downright stealing! What right had he to take
                  this lime without the plasterer's consent? If he had asked for it, he could not
                  doubt have had double the quantity he has taken, in welcome; but I don't like
                  thisâ€”it doesn't look well. I almost wish I hadn't seen it; I shall never feel just
                  right towards him again."
               The carpenter was a strictly honest man, and far above an act of meanness. He
                  regarded the rights of every one, in little as well as in great things, and could
                  not tolerate in others any departure from rectitude. What he had seen troubled
                  him. He tried to push the thought of it out of his mind, but could not succeed in
                  doing so; it haunted him for days. When he met Mr. Elliotson, he felt like
                  avoiding him, and could hardly bear to look in his face while he conversed with
                  him.
               Gage had a brother who owned a large farm in the fertile valley of a river whose
                  waters passed through the village in which Elliotson kept store. The village was a
                  depot for the receipt of nearly the entire product of this valley; it contained
                  three stores. Elliotson's was the largest, and he received, as factor, at least
                  two-thirds of the produce that came down the river; the selling of this was his
                  chief business. For several years, he had sold for Mr. Gage, the farmer, the
                  products of his land, consisting principally of wheat, rye, corn, and oats; making
                  him returns according to the ruling market prices.
               Shortly after the occurrence of the little circumstance just mentioned, the farmer
                  was in the village, and stayed, as usual, with his brother. While with him, the
                  brother asked this question:â€”"How does Elliotson manage your sales for you?"
               "Very well."
               "Are you always satisfied with the prices he gets?"
               "Why no, not always; but, then, I suppose it isn't his fault. The markets are not
                  always as high as we farmers could wish."
               "No, I suppose not. But does he return you the highest market rates?"
               "Not for every consignment; but quotations of prices and actual sales do not
                  always correspond. Sometimes we send down a lot of grain, and get for it more than
                  we expected, and sometimes less; it is just as it happens. Why do you ask these
                  questions? Isn't Mr. Elliotson the fair thing?"
               
               "Not exactly, I am sorry to say."
               "What!" The brother expressed strong surprise.
               "The fact is, Henry," said the carpenter, "I have lost my good opinion of the man,
                  and I will tell you the reason."
               He then related the story about the lime.
               "That was a little business," remarked the farmer, after he had heard the
                  relation. "I could not have believed that a man of his standing would be guilty of
                  such conduct."
               "Nor I; it really confounded me. I have thought about you ever since, and how easy
                  it would be for him, in rendering account-sales of your produce, to put the prices
                  down a cent or two a bushel less than what he actually received. It would be a
                  little matter in each particular, but quite an item in the year's business."
               "Indeed it would! But I can hardly believe that Mr. Elliotson would do such a
                  thing."
               "Nor can I; and yet there is the fact of the lime staring us in the face. That
                  shows what is in the man, and what is in is pretty sure to come out, some time or
                  other; it only needs the opportunity. When he took the lime, it was early in the
                  morning, and no one about, as he thought. He first turned it over, and then raised
                  himself up and looked all around him carefully. After that, he stooped and lifted
                  two large pieces, and carried them away. It looks bad, doesn't it?"
               "It certainly does. I don't like the appearance at all."
               "I don't know how you feel about it," said the carpenter, "but if I were in your
                  place, I would be loath to trust as much in his hands as you do."
               "I must think about it," remarked the farmer. "I should be sorry to break with
                  him, for our intercourse has been pleasant. He has always made me prompt returns.
                  I believe I never had to write to him for money in my life."
               "So far, so good; but if the returns were actually short, why"â€”
               "That's another consideration altogether."
               "Indeed it is."
               Now, although the suspicions of Gage, the carpenter, were, to all appearance, well
                  founded, yet they wronged Mr. Elliotson. He had always made the most accurate
                  returns for the produce sold, and retained not a farthing beyond the regular
                  commissions agreed upon. In all matters of regular business, his ideas were clear
                  and his practice blameless; he considered honesty to be the best policy, and was
                  always honest in his dealings. The matter of the lime was an out-of-the-way
                  operationâ€”a kind of accidental affair, for which no rule of action, involving
                  principle, had been laid down. The temptation came suddenly in his way, and he
                  fell; but the fall was so light, that he scarcely felt the concussion: he was but
                  indistinctly conscious of having done a
                  wrong act, it was such a trifling matter; but, trifling as it appeared to be, it
                  was destined to produce a serious effect upon his business. The first effect was
                  the loss of Mr. Gage's consignment. The fact stated to the farmer by his brother
                  rested upon his mind and troubled him. He continued to send his grain to Mr.
                  Elliotson for some months; but his suspicions being aroused, he began to imagine
                  that the account-sales he received showed a low range of prices. One of his
                  neighbours, who sent his produce to another store in the village, asked him one
                  day what his last load of wheat had brought.
               "A dollar and ten," replied the farmer.
               "I did rather better than that," said the neighbour.
               "Ah! How much did you get?"
               "A dollar twelve."
               "Did you, indeed? Herbert does your business?"
               "Yes."
               "Does he make prompt returns?"
               "Oh, yes. He is very prompt and very correct."
               "A dollar twelve! Have you just heard of the sale?"
               "I received the account to-day."
               "That's strange! My wheat was in every way as good as yours, and ought to have
                  brought as good a price."
               Mr. Gage was now decided in his mind about changing his agent; he felt satisfied
                  that something was wrong, and yet there was nothing wrong: the grain of the
                  neighbour had been received three days before his came to market, and, in that
                  time, the price had fallen two cents. His next lot of produce was sent to Mr.
                  Herbert, who, from this time, became his consignee. By this change, the business
                  of Mr. Elliotson suffered considerably. Gage was his largest consignor, and
                  usually made heavy purchases from him during the year, thus giving him a double
                  profit.
               From this period, the business of Elliotson gradually declined. One after another
                  of his old customers in the neighbourhood of Gage fell off, without assigning any
                  reason, and went over to Herbert, whose operations doubled within a year. The
                  cause lay in hints from farmer Gage, in reply to questions as to why he had
                  changed his consignee. He said nothing touching the integrity of Elliotson, but
                  hesitated not to allege that Herbert obtained better prices for his produce; this
                  was, of course, enough to induce others to follow his example. At the end of a
                  year, the business of Elliotson was so much reduced, that he found it very
                  difficult to keep his head above water. He was no longer as prompt in making
                  returns of sales to the farmers as before, and this caused others of them to leave
                  him.
               "What's the matter with Elliotson?" now began to be asked among his neighbours.
                  "He seems to be going down hill."
               
               But no one could answer the question. He was known as an active and energetic
                  business man, and it was believed that he would, in time, acquire a fortune. That
                  a different result was threatened, created general surprise. When a man begins to
                  go down hill, there is but little hope for him; he rarely fails to reach the
                  bottom. Thus it was with Mr. Elliotson. In three years from the day he was guilty
                  of the trifling act of taking a few pieces of lime that did not belong to him, he
                  was sold out by the sheriff. Of the cause of the blight that had fallen upon his
                  fortune, he had not the most remote conception. It never entered his imagination
                  that a suspicion of his integrity existed anywhere, or that he had ever given
                  cause for such a suspicion. In the calamity by which he was stricken, he retained
                  one consciousnessâ€”that of being an honest man.
               Educated in a store, Mr. Elliotson had no ability for obtaining a support for his
                  family beyond what such an education gave him. He was a good accountant, and had a
                  clear, strong mind. To any one keeping a store, who needed assistance, he would
                  have been invaluable. But no one in the village was in want of assistance.
               With a family of four children, the situation of Mr. Elliotson was painful in the
                  extreme. The rigour of the law had left him but a poor remnant of household
                  furniture, and with this he was about moving into a small cottage, at half the
                  rent he was paying for the comfortable home in which he had lived for ten
                  years.
               Just at this crisis, intelligence was received that the Legislature of the State
                  had approved an application that had been made to charter a banking institution,
                  to be located in the village. Books for a subscription to the capital stock were
                  immediately opened, and the amount required by the charter obtained in a few
                  days.
               As soon as it was known that the bank would go into operation, the friends of Mr.
                  Elliotson made a movement to get him appointed cashier. He was looked upon as the
                  very man, and some of the stockholders went so far as to say, that it was
                  fortunate for the institution that he happened to be out of business. Twelve
                  directors were chosen in due course, and then there came an election of officers
                  and clerks, to conduct the regular business. There were many applicants for these
                  situations. Prominent, for the office of cashier, stood the name of Mr. Elliotson.
                  On the day that the directors met, this unfortunate individual had but five
                  dollars left, and, beyond the hoped-for appointment, no apparent resource in the
                  world. It is no matter of wonder that his mind was in a state of great anxiety and
                  suspense. His friends had assured him that he would certainly get the appointment;
                  but the necessities of his circumstances were too pressing to allow these
                  assurances to give him full confidence in
                  the result of the election. If, by any mishap, he should not be appointed, he knew
                  not which way to turn to keep his family from want.
               Among the directors chosen to represent the interests of the stockholders was
                  Gage, the carpenter, who was a man of some property, and had subscribed quite
                  liberally to the stock. When Mr. Elliotson was proposed to the meeting as cashier,
                  Gage became restless.
               "He is the very man," said one.
               "We can't possibly do better," said another.
               "There isn't a name on the list of applicants comparable to his," remarked a
                  third.
               And every man spoke in his favour except Gage, who remained silent. Just as they
                  were about balloting, the carpenter said that he was sorry to be compelled to
                  object to Mr. Elliotson, but duty constrained him to do so. And then he related
                  the little circumstance already known to the reader. He ended by saying:
               "This may seem a trifling matter, gentlemen. But it is in trifles that we see most
                  clearly a man's real character. It shows that there is a lack of integrity in his
                  heart. I feel pained in making this revelation, but duty compels me to do so. I
                  would not be true to the trust that has been reposed in me, were I to withhold
                  from this board a fact that may deeply affect the interests they are bound to
                  protect."
               Surprise kept all silent for some moments.
               "Is it not possible that you may have been mistaken?" was at length asked by a
                  member of the board.
               "No, sir. I saw the thing done as clearly as I ever saw any thing in my life. To
                  make sure, however, I examined and found the lime in an out-house concealed under
                  an old plank. In a day or two afterwards it was slacked and applied to the fences.
                  It is a little thing, I know, gentlemen; and perhaps I lay too much stress upon
                  it. But I cannot have any rational confidence in a man who will steal even a pin.
                  I have made this communication from a sense of duty; the board can now act as it
                  thinks best. But I cannot vote to place Mr. Elliotson in a position where so much
                  is at stake."
               After an hour's discussion, in which three or four members of the board spoke
                  strongly in favour of Mr. Elliotson, and offered to go his security in double the
                  amount required for the cashier, it was voted to let the choice of that officer
                  lie over for a day, that there might be time for reflection.
               Mr. Elliotson sat at his window, with his eyes fixed on the building where the
                  directors were in session, his heart beating with an uneasy motion. He had been
                  seated thus for nearly two hours, and was beginning to grow restless with
                  impatience, when he saw the door open, and the gentlemen who seemed to him to hold
                  his fate in their hands slowly emerge,
                  and move, in little groups, lingeringly down the street. Of these, two, who were
                  among his warmest friends, approached his house. Now his heart became almost
                  still, and he experienced a choking sensation. A few minutes would decide his
                  fate. What was to be that fate? He scarcely dared hope for the best, and shrank
                  from contemplating the worst. The two friends paused a short distance from his
                  house, and stood for some minutes in earnest conversation. This was looked upon as
                  a bad omen; the bearers of good news would not thus pause and linger. The poor
                  man's suspense became terrible. At length the men separated, and one of them came
                  towards his house with a grave and deliberate step. From the window, Mr. Elliotson
                  could see his face. It wore a thoughtful, sober expression. His heart ceased to
                  beat for a few moments, and then fluttered on wildly. At length the man's knock
                  was heard at the door. Elliotson had scarcely strength to open it, and when he did
                  so, he stood with his knees smiting against each other, looking into his friend's
                  face without the power of utterance. To relieve this suspense, which he saw to be
                  very great, the friend saidâ€”
               "There has been no election of cashier yet."
               Elliotson leaned against the door for support.
               "None? Why not?" he was able to ask.
               "I will tell you."
               "Walk into the parlour," Elliotson had now presence sence of mind to say, and he
                  stepped back while the director entered. When alone, the latter said,
               "I regret to say, that an unexpected objection was made by a member of the board,
                  which would have defeated your election, had a ballot taken place. I therefore
                  moved to have the election for cashier postponed until to-morrow; and I have come
                  to talk to you about this objection."
               "What is it?" asked Elliotson in a husky voice.
               "It touches your character; is, in fact, a charge against your integrity as a
                  man."
               Philip Elliotson drew himself up calmly, while his eye became bright and steady,
                  and his lips arched and firm.
               "I am ready to meet all such charges," he said, with much dignity of manner. "I
                  know not a single act of my life that I would fear to have canvassed. What is the
                  allegation?"
               "Some five or six years ago, there was an addition built to this house?" said the
                  director.
               "There was."
               "Do you remember the fact that a load of lime was thrown down, late one afternoon,
                  at your back gate."
               Mr. Elliotson thought for a moment, and then saidâ€”
               "Yes, I remember it very well."
               "Do you likewise remember taking two or three pieces of that lime for your own use, and
                  concealing them in an out-house?"
               "I do." The blood mounted to the cheek of Mr. Elliotson.
               "You were seen to do this: and it is now brought forward against you, and urged as
                  a reason why you should not be given the appointment of cashier."
               Mr. Elliotson seemed stunned for a few moments. He leaned his head down upon a
                  table, and sat almost motionless for nearly a minute, while his friend looked on
                  with grief. When he at length raised his head, his face was pale but calm.
               "I am, of course, charged with being a dishonest man," he said, in a firm
                  voice.
               "That is the inference drawn from this act."
               Mr. Elliotson arose, and going to his secretary, took therefrom two account-books.
                  One of these he opened, and, turning to an account, laid it on the table before
                  the director, saying, as he did so,
               "The plasterer who finished the addition made by my landlord to this house was
                  named Eldred. He dealt at my store, and settled his accounts once in three months.
                  The addition was made in June, 18â€”. On the tenth of July, in the same year, you
                  see, there is a credit to his account of fifteen cents. Now I will show you the
                  day-book entry."
               The day-book was opened, when the entry stood thus:â€”
               "James Eldred, Cr: By lime used for whitewashing washing at the time he was
                  plastering my houseâ€”fifteen cents."
               "I took the lime," said Elliotson, after he had exhibited this entry,
                  "thoughtlessly. It was not my property, and I had no right to it. But I did not
                  reflect at the time. About a month afterwards, a thought of what I had done
                  flashed across my mind, and startled me. I saw that I had been guilty of taking
                  another's property for my own use, and immediately made this entry. In settlement,
                  I pointed out the matter to Eldred, and he said it was of no consequence whatever,
                  that I was welcome to the lime, and double as much more. He did not wish the
                  deduction made from his account: but I insisted on its being done. If you will see
                  him, he will show you this credit on the bill I then rendered."
               "May I have these books at the meeting of directors to-morrow?" eagerly asked the
                  friend, who was trembling with delight.
               "Certainly. It is but just that this charge should be fully refuted."
               "Then you may set your heart at rest about the cashiership. You will certainly get
                  the appointment. But for this matter, you would have received every vote to-day,
                  on the first balloting."
               When the directors met on the next day, and the books of Mr. Elliotson were laid
                  open at the entry just mentioned, Mr. Gage was confounded.
               
               "I have not a word more to say," he remarked. "Mr. Elliotson has my vote. It
                  grieves me to think that I have wronged so upright a man."
               The vote was at once taken, and Elliotson elected unanimously to the office of
                  cashier at a salary of twelve hundred dollars a year.
               About a year after this happy change in Mr. Elliotson's external circumstances,
                  Herbert, the storekeeper who had obtained nearly the whole of his country custom,
                  and accumulated quite a handsome little property, died, and his widow attempted,
                  by means of a clerk, to carry on the business. But, in the course of a few months,
                  her friends advised her to sell out and be content with the amount of property
                  left to her by her husband, which was enough for her support. As soon as this fact
                  became known to Mr. Gage, the carpenter, whose mind had never felt easy about Mr.
                  Elliotson, he called upon the latter, and said to him, after mentioning the fact
                  that Mrs. Herbert wished to sell out,
               "There is a good chance for you, and you ought to embrace it. You understand the
                  business, and can make by it more than double what you are now receiving."
               But Elliotson shook his head.
               "Depend upon it, you ought not to let this opportunity pass. I know that you can
                  have all my brother's consignments again, for he has told me that he was sorry
                  that he had ever taken them out of your hands. And I have no doubt but that you
                  can retain every one of Herbert's regular customers."
               "Perhaps I might. I believe with you that the opportunity is a very good one. But
                  it is not in my power to embrace it."
               "Why?"
               "Capital is required, and I have nothing but my salary."
               "How much will be needed?"
               "At least four or five thousand dollars; besides a credit in purchasing out the
                  stock and good-will of the store."
               "Both of these, I think, can be supplied."
               Elliotson shook his head again.
               "If I will get you the money and the credit you need, will you take the store?"
                  asked Gage.
               "Certainly I will," was replied.
               "Then you may consider the thing as settled."
               And it was settled. Mr. Elliotson took the store, and went on with the business,
                  quite as successfully as it had been conducted by the former owner. He is now in
                  excellent circumstances. But there are two things that he cannot understand, and
                  which puzzle him whenever he thinks about them. One is, the cause of the sudden
                  reverse in his fortunes that visited him so strangely, and the other is the
                  unexpected offer of Mr. Gage to put him in business again, with as much capital
                  and as large a credit as he needed. He often sits and ponders upon these two circumstances, but they still remain
                  shrouded in mystery. Mr. Gage is satisfied with making restitution in his own way,
                  without exposing the part he took in ruining the merchant. He never alluded to the
                  subject, except to his brother and to the board of directors, and they felt it to
                  be imperative on them to keep the whole thing a profound secret.
            
            
               UNFADING FLOWERS.
               THIRTY years ago, a small, barefooted boy paused to admire the flowers in a
                  well-cultivated garden. The child was an orphan, and had already felt how hard was
                  an orphan's lot. The owner of the garden, who was trimming a border, noticed the
                  lad and spoke kindly to him.
               "Do you love flowers?" said he.
               The boy replied, "Oh, yes. We used to have such beautiful flowers in our
                  garden."
               The man laid down his knife, and, gathering a few flowers, took them to the fence,
                  through the panels of which the boy was looking, and handed them to him, saying,
                  as he did so, "Here's a little bunch for you."
               A flush went over the child's face as he took the flowers. He did not make any
                  reply, but in his large eyes, as he lifted them to the face of the man, was an
                  expression of thankfulness, to be read as plainly as words in a book.
               The act on the part of the man was one of spontaneous kindness, and scarcely
                  thought of again, but by the child it was never forgotten.
               Years went by, and through toil, privation, and suffering, both in body and mind,
                  the boy grew up to manhood. From ordeals like this come forth our most effective
                  men. If kept from vicious associates, the lad of feeling and mental activity
                  becomes ambitious, and rises in society above the common level. So it proved in
                  the case of this orphan boy; he had but few advantages of education, but such as
                  were afforded were all improved. It happened that his lot was cast in a
                  printing-office, and the young compositor soon became interested in his work. He
                  did not set the types as a mere mechanic, but went beyond the duties of his
                  calling, entering into the ideas to which he was giving verbal expression, and
                  making them his own. At twenty-one, he was a young man of more than ordinary
                  intelligence and force of character. At thirty-five, he was the conductor of a
                  widely-circulated and profitable newspaper, and, as a man, respected and esteemed
                  by all who knew him.
               During the earnest struggle that all men enter into who are ambitious to rise in
                  the world, the thoughts do not often go
                  back and rest meditatively upon the earlier time of life. But after success has
                  crowned each well-directed effort, and the gaining of a desired position no longer
                  remains a subject of doubt, the mind often brings up from the far-off past most
                  vivid recollections of incidents and impressions that were painful or pleasurable
                  at the time, and which are now seen to have an influence, more or less decided,
                  upon the whole after-life. In this state of reflection sat one day the man whom we
                  have introduced. After musing a long time, deeply abstracted, he took his pen and
                  wrote hastily, and these were the sentences he traced upon the paper that lay
                  before him:â€”
               "How indelibly does a little act of kindness, performed at the right moment,
                  impress itself upon the mind. We meet, as we pass through the world, so much of
                  rude selfishness, that we guard ourselves against it, and scarcely feel its
                  effects; but spontaneous kindness comes so rarely, that we are surprised when it
                  appears, and delighted and refreshed as by the perfume of flowers in the dreary
                  winter. When we were a small boy, an orphan, and with a memory of a home for ever
                  lost, too vivid in our young heart, a man into whose beautiful garden we stood
                  looking, pulled a few flowers and handed them through the fence, speaking a kind
                  word as he did so. He did not know, and perhaps never will know, how deeply we
                  were touched by this act. From a little boy we loved flowers, and ere that
                  heaviest affliction a child ever knowsâ€”loss of parentsâ€”fell upon us, we almost
                  lived among them. But death separated between us and all those tender associations
                  and affections that, to the hearts of children, are like dew to the tender grass;
                  we entered the dwelling of the stranger, and were treated henceforth as if we had,
                  or ought to have no feelings, no hopes, no weaknesses. The harsh command came
                  daily to our ears; and not even for work well done, or faithful service, were we
                  cheered by words of commendation.
               "One dayâ€”we were not more than eleven years oldâ€”something turned our thoughts back
                  upon the earlier and happier time when we had a true home, and were loved and
                  cared for. We were once more in the garden and among the sweet blossoms, as of
                  old, and the mother on whose bosom we had slept, sat under the grape-arbour, and
                  we filled her lap with flowers. There was a smile of love on her face, and her
                  lips were parting with some kind word of affection, when, to scatter into nothing
                  these dear images of the lonely boy, came the sharp command of a master, and in
                  obedience we started forth to perform some needed service. Our way was by the
                  garden of which we have spoken; and it was on this occasion, and while the
                  suddenly dissipated image of our mother among the flowers was re-forming itself in
                  our young imagination, that the incident to which we have alluded occurred. We can
                     never forget the grateful perfume of
                  those flowers, nor the strength and comfort which the kind words and manner of the
                  giver imparted to our fainting spirits. We took them home, kept them fresh as long
                  as water would preserve their life and beauty; and when they faded, and the leaves
                  fell, pale and withered, upon the ground, we grieved for their loss as if a real
                  friend had been taken away.
               "It is a long, long time since that incident occurred; but the flowers which there
                  sprang up in our bosom are fresh and beautiful still: they have neither faded nor
                  witheredâ€”they cannot, they are unfading flowers. We never looked upon
                  the man that gave them to us, that our heart did not warm toward him. Twenty years
                  ago, we lost sight of him; but if still among the dwellers of the earth, and in
                  need of a friend, we should divide with him our last morsel."
               An old man, with hair whitened by the snows of many winters, was sitting in a room
                  that was poorly supplied with furniture, his head bowed, and his gaze cast
                  dreamily on the floor. A pale young girl came in while he sat thus musing. Lifting
                  his eyes to her face, he said, while he tried to look cheerful, "Ellen, dear, you
                  must not go out to-day."
               "I feel a great deal better, grandpa," replied the girl, forcing a smile. "I am
                  able to go to work again."
               "No, child, you are not," said the old man, firmly; "and you must not think of
                  such a thing."
               "Don't be so positive, grandpa." And as she uttered this little sentence in a
                  half-playful voice, she laid her hand among the thin gray locks on the old man's
                  head, and smoothed them caressingly. "You know that I must not be idle."
               "Wait, child, until your strength returns."
               "Our wants will not wait, grandpa." As the girl said this, her face became sober.
                  The old man's eyes again fell to the floor, and a heavy sigh came from his
                  bosom.
               "I will be very careful, and not overwork myself again," resumed Ellen, after a
                  pause.
               "You must not go to-day," said the old man, arousing himself. "It is murder. Wait
                  at least until to-morrow. You will be stronger then."
               "If I don't go back, I may lose my place. You know that I have been at home for
                  three days. Work will not wait. The last time I was kept away by sickness, a
                  customer was disappointed, and there was a good deal of trouble about it."
               Another sigh came heavily from the old man's heart.
               "I will go," said the girl. "Perhaps they will let me off for a day longer. If so,
                  I will come back, for I must not lose the place."
               No further resistance was made by the old man. In a little time, he was alone. She
                  had gone to work. Her employers would not
                  let her go away, feeble as she was, without a forfeiture of her place.
               About midday, finding that Ellen did not come back, the old man, after taking some
                  food, went out.
               The pressure of seventy winters was upon him, and his steps were slow and
                  carefully taken.
               "I must get something to do. I can work still," he muttered to himself, as he
                  moved along the streets. "The dear child is killing herself, and all for me."
               But what could he do? Who wanted the services of an old man, like him, whose mind
                  had lost its clearness, whose step faltered, and whose hand was no longer steady?
                  In vain he made application for employment. Younger and more vigorous men filled
                  all the places, and he was pushed aside. Discouraged and drooping in spirit, he
                  went back to his home, there to wait the fall of evening, which was to bring the
                  return of the only being left on earth to love him. At nightfall, Ellen came in.
                  Her face, so pale in the morning, was now slightly flushed; and her eyes were
                  brighter than when she went out. The grandfather was not deceived by this; he knew
                  it to be a sign of disease. He took her handâ€”it was hotâ€”and when he stooped to
                  kiss her gentle lips, he found them burning with fever.
               "Ellen, my child, why did you go to work to-day? I knew it would make you sick,"
                  said the old man in a voice of anguish.
               Ellen tried to smile, and not appear so very ill; but nature was too much
                  oppressed.
               "I have brought home some work, and will not go out to-morrow," she remarked. "I
                  think the walk fatigued me more than any thing else. I shall be better after a
                  good night's sleep."
               But the girl's hopes failed her. The morning found her so weak that she could not
                  rise from her bed; and when the grandfather came into her room to learn how she
                  passed the night, he found her weeping on her pillow. She had endeavoured to get
                  up, but her head, which was aching terribly, grew dizzy, and she fell back, under
                  a despairing consciousness that her strength was gone.
               The day passed, but Ellen did not grow better. The fever still kept her body
                  prostrate. Once or twice, when her grandfather was out of the room, she took up
                  the work she had brought home, and tried to do some of it while sitting up in bed.
                  But ere a minute had passed, she became faint, while all grew dark around her. She
                  was no better when night came. If her mind could have restedâ€”if she had been free
                  from anxious and distressing thoughts, nature would have had power to react; but,
                  as it was, the pressure was too great. She could not forget that they had scarcely
                  so much as a dollar left, and that her old grandfather was too feeble to work.
                  Upon her rested all the burden of their support, and she was helpless.
               
               The next morning, Ellen was better. She could sit up without feeling dizzy,
                  although her head still ached, and the fever had only slightly abated. But the old
                  man would not permit her to leave her bed, though she begged him earnestly to let
                  her do so.
               The bundle of work that Ellen had brought home was wrapped in a newspaper, and
                  this her grandfather took up to read, several times during the day.
               "This is Mr. Tâ€”'s newspaper," said he, as he opened it and saw the title. "I knew
                  Tâ€”when he was a poor orphan boy; but of course he has forgotten me. He has
                  prospered wonderfully."
               And then his eyes went along the columns of the paper, and he read aloud to Ellen
                  such things as he thought would interest her. Among others, was a reminiscence by
                  the editorâ€”the same that we have just given. The old man's voice faltered as he
                  read. The little incident, so feelingly described, had long since been hidden in
                  his memory, under the gathering dust of time. But now the dust was swept away, and
                  he saw his own beautiful garden. He was in it, and among the flowers; and
                  wistfully looking through the fence, stood the orphan boy. He remembered that he
                  felt pity for him, and he remembered, as if it were but yesterday, though thirty
                  years had intervened, the light that went over the child's face as he handed him a
                  few flowers, that were to fade and wither in a day.
               Yes, the old man's voice faltered while he read; and when he came to the last
                  sentence, the paper dropped upon the floor, and, clasping his hands together, he
                  lifted his dim eyes upward, while his lips moved in whispered words of
                  thankfulness.
               "What ails you, grandpa?" asked Ellen in surprise. But the old man did not seem to
                  hear her voice.
               "Dear grandpa," repeated the girl, "why do you look so strangely?" She had risen
                  in bed, and was bending toward him.
               "Ellen, my child," said the old man, a light breaking over his countenance as
                  though a sunbeam had suddenly come into the room, "it was your old grandfather
                  gave the flowers to that poor little boy. Did you hear what he said? he would
                  divide his last morsel."
               The old man moved about the room with his unsteady steps, talking in a wandering
                  wayâ€”so over-joyed at the prospect of relief for his child, that he was nearly
                  beside himself. But there yet lingered some embers of pride in his heart; and from
                  these the ashes were blown away, and they became bright and glowing. The thought
                  of asking a favour for the return of that little act, which was to him at the time
                  a pleasure, came with a feeling of reluctance. But when he looked at the pale
                  young girl, with eyes closed and her face half buried in the pillow, he murmured
                  to himself, "It is for youâ€”for you!" and, taking up his staff, went tottering into
                  the open air.
               The editor was sitting in his office writing, when he heard the door open, and, turning, he saw before
                  him an old man with bent form and snowy head. Something in the visitor's
                  countenance struck him as familiar, but he did not recognise him as one he had
                  seen before.
               "Is Mr. Tâ€”in?" asked the old man.
               "My name is Tâ€”," replied the editor.
               "You?" There was a slight expression of surprise in the old man's voice.
               "Yes, I am Tâ€”, my friend," was kindly said. "Can I do any thing for you? Take the
                  chair."
               The offered seat was accepted; and as the old man sank into it, his countenance
                  and manner betrayed his emotion.
               "I have come," and his voice was unsteady, "to do what I could not do for myself
                  alone; but I cannot see my poor, sick grandchild wear out and die under the weight
                  of burdens that that are too heavy to be borne. For her sake, I have conquered my
                  pride."
               There was a pause.
               "Go on," said Tâ€”, who was looking at the old man earnestly, and endeavouring to
                  fix his identity.
               "You don't know me?"
               "Your face is not entirely strange," said Tâ€”. "It must have been a long time since
                  we met."
               "Long? Oh, yes! it is a long, long time. You were a boy, and I unbent by age."
               "Markland!" exclaimed Tâ€”, with sudden energy, springing to his feet as the truth
                  flashed upon him. "Say, is it not so?"
               "My name is Markland."
               "And do we meet thus again?" said Tâ€”, with emotion, as he grasped the old man's
                  hand. "Ah, sir! I have never forgotten you. When a sad-hearted boy, you spoke to
                  me kindly; and the words comforted me, when I had no other comfort. That bunch of
                  flowers you gave meâ€”you remember it, no doubtâ€”is still fresh in my heart: not a
                  leaf or petal has faded; they are as bright and green, and full of perfume, as
                  when I first hid them there; and there they will bloom for ever, the unfading
                  flowers of gratitude. I am glad you have come, though grieved that your declining
                  years are made heavier by misfortune. I have enough and to spare."
               "I have not come for charity," returned Markland. "I have hands that would not be
                  idle, though it is but little they can accomplish."
               "Be not troubled on that account, my friend," was kindly answered. "I will find
                  something for you to do; but first tell me about yourself."
               Thus encouraged, the old man told his story. It was the common story of the loss
                  of property and friends, and the approach of want with declining years. Tâ€”saw that
                  pride and native independence was still strong in Markland's bosom, feeble as he was, and really unable to enter
                  upon any serious employment; and his first impression was to save his feelings, at
                  the same time that he extended to him entire and permanent relief. This he found
                  no difficulty in doing, and the old man was soon after placed in a situation where
                  but little application was necessary, while the income was all-sufficient for the
                  comfortable support of himself and grandchild.
               The flowers offered with a purely humane feeling proved to be fadeless flowers;
                  and their beauty and perfume came back to the sense of the giver, when all other
                  flowers were dead and dying on his dark and dreary way.
            
            
               THREE SCENES IN THE LIFE OF A CONSUMPTIVE.
               
                  SCENE FIRST.
                  "YOU have no right to abuse your health, Margaret," said Mrs. Ellis to her
                     daughter, a tall, delicately-formed girl, whose narrow chest, long and small
                     neck, slender limbs, and pure, transparent skin, indicated a constitution
                     highly susceptible to pulmonary irritations. The mother spoke in a decided
                     voice, and with some sternness of manner.
                  "I suppose I may do with myself as I please," replied the daughter, in a tone
                     of levity.
                  "Not so, Margaret."
                  "If I lose my health, I have only to suffer for it myself; no one else will
                     have to bear the pain of my indiscretion, as you call it. Isn't this so?"
                  "Do you really think this?" asked the mother.
                  "Certainly I do. Whatever pain I suffer is my ownâ€”not another's. Can another
                     feel my headache, or be affected with the fever that lays me upon a bed of
                     sickness?"
                  "Margaret," replied the mother, less sternly than she had at first spoken, but with equal
                     seriousness of manner, "I can hardly believe you in earnest in what you say.
                     You are now a woman, capable of reflection, and ought to be able to see, in a
                     moment, that you cannot be sick for an hour without affecting others."
                  "In what way?"
                  "Can you not see for yourself?"
                  "I certainly cannot."
                  "If you were now sick, instead of being in good health, do you not suppose that
                     I would feel anxious and troubled on your account?"
                  "I suppose you would. Still, you needn't feel so, unless from choice; the
                     actual pain I suffered couldn't affect you."
                  "If I were sick, could you help feeling anxious? Would this depend upon
                     choice?"
                  "No, I presume not."
                  "And as little would my anxiety depend upon choice, as you must see, on a
                     moment's reflection; but the way in which the ill-health of any one affects
                     others is far more serious than this. Society is bound together by the law of
                     reciprocal uses: every thing we do has some reference to others. In fact, there
                     is no act of our lives that does not, in some way, impress itself upon those
                     around us. To each of us is given some talent, the exercise of which is
                     designed to promote the common welfare. Ill-health must, of course, prevent the
                     proper exercise of this talent. You can see, from this, that we have no
                     right to abuse our health, for, if we do so, we cannot properly discharge the
                     duties we owe to others."
                  The thoughtless girl met this by saying, with a lightness of manner that
                     chilled her mother's feelingsâ€”
                  "Oh, as to that, I don't profess to be governed by motives of good to others. I
                     have not attained so perfect a state yet, and am afraid I never shall; it is
                     about as much as I can do to think of myself."
                  "The time may come, Margaret," replied the mother to this, "when you will feel
                     differentlyâ€”when you may desire the good of others with an intense desire, and
                     not be able, from ill-health, to secure it. To see those we love suffering
                     privations from our inability to do for them what they need, and for which they
                     can depend on none other, is a bitter thing; and that you may be spared this,
                     is one of my reasons for urging you now to regard your health."
                  "I am not much afraid but that I shall be able to do all that justice can
                     require me to do for others," Margaret answered. "My health is good enough now,
                     except a little cold, that will soon pass off, and I know of no reason why I
                     should not remain in as good health for many years. I am not aware that I abuse
                     myself very much."
                  "You are perhaps aware that you inherit a predisposition disposition to consumption, and that, from this
                     circumstance, a slight cold is always a serious matter, and should be treated
                     as such."
                  "If I have got to die of consumption, there is no help for it, I suppose,"
                     returned the daughter. "Taking care of slight colds is not going to save
                     me."
                  "That is a mistake, which I hope you will permit me at once to correct. Most
                     lung-diseases, when once excited, prove incurable. No one is born with
                     consumption, but only with a predisposition to this fatal disease, in a high
                     susceptibility to inflammation of the throat and chest. There are but few cases
                     in which this predisposition is so great as to be affected by the common
                     atmospheric changes, if the individual pays particular regard to health; but if
                     a cold, unfortunately, be taken, even if afterwards cured, the predisposition
                     to inflammation is increased. Should the cold be neglected, the inflammation
                     may become chronic or permanent, and then life is inevitably shortened five,
                     ten, or it may be more than twenty years."
                  "I have colds often; but they get well, without the serious consequences of
                     which you speak."
                  "You never had a cold, Margaret," said Mrs. Ellis, with much earnestness, "that
                     did not injure you, in an increased liability to take cold which it entailed. I
                     have noticed this: you take cold now easier than you did a year ago."
                  "I don't know that I do."
                  "I am sure of it; my anxiety makes me observant. Colds are not only more easily
                     taken by you, but they are longer in getting well, and their effects are seen
                     in a general prostration of your whole system, as well as in a greater
                     oppression, accompanied with more tenderness and pain in your chest."
                  "You think too much about this, mother," replied Margaret. "You give yourself
                     needless alarm, by imagining things to exist which have no reality. I am not at
                     all conscious of the increased liability to cold of which you speak."
                  "But I tell you, my child, it does exist. I am older than you, and am a more
                     careful observer. I know, and you know that I have to be exceedingly cautious
                     how I expose myself. You remember how near to death's door I was, a year ago,
                     from inflammation of the lungs, brought on by exposure and cold. Such serious
                     effects did not formerly result from colds; but now, the susceptibility to
                     inflammation is so great, that my life is endangered by any sudden exposure. At
                     your age, I was in better health than you are, for I had, naturally, a better
                     constitution. Then I had no one to counsel me, as you haveâ€”for my mother died
                     young, of the fatal disease which she entailed upon me, and which I have
                     entailed upon youâ€”and I exposed myself as you are now exposing yourself. The
                     consequence was that I not only injured myself, but injured my children. I am incurably diseased, and they have
                     a predisposition to disease greater than I had. Now, judge for yourself whether
                     I am not correct in saying that you have no right to abuse your health. I had
                     no right to abuse my health, for such abuse would injure my children, as, alas!
                     it has done. You expect to marry soon, and you have every reason to believe
                     that you will have children. If in your body exist the seeds of an incurable
                     disease, they will be sown in the bodies of your children. If you have a
                     diseased body, you cannot give to them a healthy one. Pause, then, and reflect
                     whether you have any right to curse your children with disease and premature
                     death."
                  The daughter sat silent, and the mother continued:â€”"I trust you will now see
                     that you have a duty to others that cannot be disregarded. Think of yourself as
                     the wife of the man to whom you have already given your affections. Ten or
                     twelve years have passed since the day of your marriage, and this lapse of time
                     has served only to prove the wisdom of your choice, and to unite you more
                     closely to your husband. Children have blessed your union, and are springing up
                     around you, and calling for your earnest and constant care, and drawing upon
                     your tenderest affections. Will it add any thing to the happiness of this
                     state, to see in your oldest child an undue sensitiveness to all external
                     impressions, united with a predisposition to inflammation of the throat and
                     lungs, that shows itself whenever the slightest cold is taken? Or to be
                     yourself, from ill-health, unable to minister to the comforts of those who are
                     best beloved, and for whom you would then be willing to make almost any
                     sacrifice? And what is much worse than this may happenâ€”and is more than likely
                     to happenâ€”death may snatch you away, and leave your innocent, helpless little
                     children to be given into the care of others, who will not love them as you
                     love them."
                  The daughter still continued silent, and Mrs. Ellis, after a brief pause,
                     added:â€”
                  "It is now known that parents transmit to their children tendencies to both
                     mental and bodily diseases, if they have these diseases in their minds and
                     bodies. A child born of an unhealthy parent cannot have a perfectly healthy
                     body; nor can a child born of a parent whose passions are not under proper
                     control, have a healthy mind. If a mother, from want of proper reflection, and
                     a disregard for the good of those who may be affected by her conduct, abuse and
                     destroy her health, she will transmit to the minds of her children the same
                     disregard of what is just and right that she has, and the same tendencies to
                     bodily disease. Thus, she will curse her children with a double curse. Think of
                     this, Margaret, and for the sake of the children that may one day gather around
                     you, carefully preserve your health now; and, with equal, nay, greater care,
                     seek to bring your mind under the
                     control of right reason, that your children may inherit orderly instead of
                     disorderly mental tendencies."
                  The seriousness with which her mother spoke, more than her words, impressed the
                     mind of Margaret, and made her, for a time, feel sober; but the effect was not
                     strong enough to induce her to refrain from going to a ball that evening,
                     although the air was damp and chilly, and she was but partially recovered from
                     a recent cold. It was in the hope of dissuading her from going to this ball,
                     that her mother had spoken so plainly.
                  "If you will go, Margaret," said Mrs. Ellis, when her daughter left her room
                     and came down dressed for the gay assembly, of which she was to make one, "I
                     must insist on your protecting yourself as far as it can possibly be done. That
                     shawl is too thin; you must wear your cloak."
                  "But I am going in a carriage, mother."
                  "In passing from the door to the carriage, both in going and returning, the
                     cold air will penetrate to your very body, unless you have some better
                     protection; and even in a close carriage, you need to be more warmly clad than
                     this. Go, dear, and get your cloak."
                  "It will be so much in my way, mother. I am sure this shawl will be warm
                     enough. But, if you think not, I will wear my boa."
                  "Oh, no! Don't think of that. You are hoarse now. A boa round your neck will
                     only cause it to perspire, and the first breath of air that blows upon it will
                     check this perspiration and increase the inflammation of your throat. You had
                     much better go as you are."
                  "I shall be warm enough. This shawl is thicker than you suppose. Feel it."
                  But Mrs. Ellis shook her head and looked grave.
                  "You'll spoil all my pleasure to-night, if you look so serious, mother," said
                     Margaret.
                  "And you will spoil all mine, if you do not pay more regard to your health.
                     Surely," and the mother cast her eyes down as she spoke, "you are not going to
                     wear those stockings! You might almost as well go without any."
                  "They are thin, I know. But it is so much trouble to change your stockings
                     after you get there; and, besides, in stepping from the door to the carriage,
                     there is not the least danger of taking cold."
                  All remonstrance proved vain. When Mrs. Ellis entered the parlour with
                     Margaret, she said to the young man who was awaiting her daughter, and who was
                     under an engagement of marriage with her:
                  "Mr. Cranston, I wish you would try and teach this young lady a little
                     prudence. She is going out, to-night, too thinly clad, and must inevitably take
                     more cold. I want her to wear her cloak, but she thinks her shawl thick
                     enough."
                  
                  "Don't say a word, mother," laughingly retorted Margaret. "I am not quite so
                     frail as you would make me believe I am. This shawl is abundantly warm. Come,
                     Henry, I am ready. Good-night, mother! Don't sit up for me. I have a key, and
                     can get in at any time."
                  And so saying, the thoughtless young girl danced lightly from the room, and,
                     springing from the street-door, was in the carriage in a moment. Mrs. Ellis
                     sank down into a chair with saddened feelings, as soon as she was alone, and
                     remained nearly motionless for fully half an hour. Then she arose, and slowly
                     retired, still in deep abstraction of mind.
               
               
                  SCENE SECOND.
                  IT was far past the hour at which the weary head usually finds its pillow. The
                     clock had struck twelve, one, and two, and the hands still moved steadily over
                     the dial, approaching nearer and nearer to the third chime since the noon of
                     night. But Margaret had not yet returned, and her mother sat alone, awaiting
                     her arrival. More than twenty times had she aroused herself to listen to the
                     sound of approaching carriage wheels, only to sink down with a feeling of
                     disappointment, as they went rumbling by and were heard no more by her.
                  At last, over-wearied, she laid her head upon the table at which she was
                     sittingâ€”in a few moments, her senses were locked in sleep. From this state of
                     unconsciousness she was aroused by the hand of her daughter upon her arm.
                  "Bless me, mother! It can't be possible that you have been sitting up for me
                     all this time!" said Margaret, who had left her lover at the door and glided
                     hastily in just as the clock was striking three. She spoke in a husky,
                     whispering voice, that thrilled through the mother's frame, and instantly
                     restored her lost consciousness to its fullest state of activity. Starting up,
                     she looked eagerly into Margaret's face, and saw that her cheeks were deeply
                     flushed, and that her eyes had lost their usual brightness.
                  "You have stayed late, but that can't be helped now. How do you feel?"
                  "Oh, very well," was replied with an effort to speak cheerfully and appear
                     unconcerned: "only I am a little hoarser than I was," she added, conscious that
                     she was only speaking in a whisper, "but that will be gone by morning. You know
                     that the least cold makes me hoarse. But it's nothing. I shall be as well as
                     ever to-morrow."
                  Margaret saw, as she spoke, that the eyes of her mother were fixed
                     penetratingly upon her. In spite of herself, she was forced to drop her own to
                     the floor, while a flush of confusion passed over her face.
                  "You breathe with difficulty," said Mrs. Ellis. "Have you no pain in your
                     breast?"
                  
                  "A slight pain in my side, and some pain here," placing her finger on the
                     throat-pit.
                  The mother took hold of her hand.
                  "Your hand is like ice!" said she. "How are your feet?â€”cold?"
                  "A little."
                  "Go quickly up to your room and get into bed," said Mrs. Ellis, exhibiting the
                     alarm and anxiety she felt. "I will fill some bottles with hot water and bring
                     them up immediately to place at your feet. If it were not so late, I would have
                     the doctor sent for."
                  "You give yourself too much uneasiness, mother," returned Margaret. "There is
                     no cause whatever for it. It is late, and I am a good deal fatigued. Having
                     taken a little more cold, it can't be expected that I should feel perfectly
                     well. But a few hours' sleep will restore me. By morning, I shall be as bright
                     as ever."
                  "I hope it may be so," was the mother's reply. "Go, and get into bed at once;
                     and I will be with you in a few moments."
                  In obedience to her mother's wishes, as well as her own inclinations, Margaret
                     went up quickly to her chamber. Mrs. Ellis soon followed with the bottles of
                     hot water, which were placed at her daughter's feet. It was time some remedial
                     agent were applied, for not only were Margaret's hands and feet cold, but the
                     chilliness had passed through her entire frame, and she was now shaking like
                     one in an ague-fit. To overcome this, the mother used all the means within her
                     reach. It was nearly day-dawn before Margaret found sufficient relief from the
                     chilliness, pain, and general uneasiness with which she was affected, to sleep.
                     Then she sank into an uneasy slumber, that was broken by frequent nervous
                     starts, and attended by moanings and words incoherently spoken. Mrs. Ellis did
                     not leave her chamber until morning, when she despatched a servant for their
                     physician, with a pressing request for his immediate attendance.
                  The doctor promptly obeyed the summons. He found the patient suffering from a
                     high degree of inflammation of the larynx and trachea, attended by too evident
                     indications of its rapid descent towards the lungs. Prescribing such treatment
                     as he hoped would check this downward tendency of the disease, he left,
                     promising to call in again in the afternoon. On his second visit, he found the
                     family somewhat relieved in consequence of a subsidence of the hoarseness; but
                     this, he was sorry to find, on examination, was a less favourable symptom than
                     had been supposed. It indicated merely a change in the location of the disease
                     from the larynx to the bronchia, where increased pain was felt.
                  On the following morning, all the symptoms of an attack of acute pneumonia were
                     apparent. The patient complained of great oppression and pain in the breast, that was increased by a full
                     inspiration, also, in the side, with a sense of weight under the ribs. The
                     hoarseness was nearly all gone, but in its place was a deep cough, that seemed
                     to lacerate the breast at every concussion. She could not lie upon her left
                     side at all, and only for a short time upon her right side, without
                     considerable pain. Lying upon her back relieved the pain she felt, but this
                     posture produced a feeling of suffocation.
                  All the patient's symptoms gradually became worse. Her pulse, which was at
                     first full and hard, became quick and sharp, her respiration more difficult,
                     and the pains she experienced more severe.
                  "Do you think her lungs affected, doctor?" the parents anxiously inquired, not
                     understanding that every symptom she had, indicated a high state of
                     inflammation in that vital organ.
                  "There is some inflammation there," replied the doctor, evasively.
                  "She is not so hoarse as she was," said the mother, speaking as if she supposed
                     that at least to be a favourable symptom.
                  "No, the hoarseness is better," was the physician's brief reply. Then quickly
                     changing the subject, he gave some particular directions for their observance,
                     and, taking up his hat, bade the anxious parents good-morning.
                  In spite of all the physician's efforts, the disease continued to advance
                     rapidly. By the end of a week, the bright colour of Margaret's cheeks changed
                     to a livid hue. Her neck, face, and chest were constantly bathed in a cold and
                     clammy perspiration; her countenance was anxious and distressed; her
                     expectoration, though not abundant, was sometimes tinged with blood; she was so
                     weak as to be unable to sit up in bed, or to speak without pain or a feeling of
                     suffocation. Hope died in the hearts of the parents and friends.
                  This low state continued for nearly two weeks, without much apparent increase
                     or decrease in the most alarming symptoms, except that the patient's
                     respiration, towards the end of this time, became easier, and she could speak
                     with less pain. But neither herself nor parents were much encouraged to hope
                     for a favourable termination of the disease.
                  "Mother," said Margaret, in a low, feeble voice, as her parent sat holding one
                     of her thin, white hands in hers, "I have thought a great deal, since I have
                     been sick, of what you said on the night of that ball. Indeed, I have scarcely
                     thought of any thing else. I did not clearly comprehend you then: but now it is
                     as plain as if it were written out before me. You said I had no right to
                     disregard my health, because its injury or entire loss would affect others as
                     well as myself. How plain this is to me now! Have not you and all my best and
                     nearest friends suffered most deeply on my account? And have I not brought
                     disease upon myself, which, even if my
                     life is spared, may leave me with an enfeebled constitution, and an inability
                     to do for others the first and most imperative duties I owe them. How blind and
                     thoughtless I have been!"
                  Tears filled the eyes of the sufferer, and emotion checked her utterance.
                  "Do not think of this, now, my child," returned the mother. "It can only
                     disturb your mind and hinder your recovery. If, in the dispensation of a wise
                     and good Providence, your life should mercifully be spared, I trust you will
                     let the past time suffice wherein you have wrought folly, and be wise in the
                     future."
                  Margaret was about making a reply, when something rose in her throat, which she
                     threw up with a slight effort. It was bright red blood! In a moment after her
                     mouth was again filled, the effusion being rapid. She became deadly pale.
                  "My good resolutions are all in vain," she murmured, the tears again coming to
                     her eyes. "It is too late!"
                  A hurried message was sent for the physician, who happened, fortunately, to be
                     at home. He came immediately, and succeeded in checking the rapid flow of blood
                     from the lungs, but not in stanching it altogether. The bleeding continued for
                     several days, by which time Margaret was reduced so low, that none but her
                     mother, the nurse, and physician were admitted to her chamber. But what had
                     seemed a fatal change in the disease, proved to be a beneficial one. All
                     inflammation subsided, and nature had only to heal the lacerations upon which
                     the hemorrhage had depended, and aid the whole system in a return to health.
                     This return was very slow, and, what was worse, proved to be only an imperfect
                     one. The glow of health, which had given to the face of Margaret so much
                     brightness and beauty, never came back, except as a hectic flush when something
                     occurred to disturb the orderly performance in her body of all its functions.
                     The least exposure to cold made her sick, with a slight or more serious
                     oppression of the chest, pain, and cough; and all irregularities of diet, or
                     fatigue, were visited with more or less evil consequences. Bitterly and with
                     unavailing regret did she lament the folly that she had thus brought disease
                     upon her, and which threatened to render not only her life a burden, but to
                     hinder her from discharging her duties to others, and finally to abridge her
                     life by many years.
                  "Were you really in earnest, mother," said Margaret one day, after she was so
                     far recovered as to be able to sit up and walk across her room, "when you spoke
                     about parents transmitting to their children a predisposition to the particular
                     diseases from which they suffered?"
                  This question was asked after she had been sitting in deep thought for some
                     time.
                  "Deeply in earnest," replied Mrs. Ellis. "It follows from this immutable law in nature, that
                     like produces like. As the quality of the cause is, such must and will be the
                     quality of the effect. But look around you, and see for yourself. The mother of
                     Helen Malcolm is now dying of consumption; and you know that Helen is so
                     susceptible to coughs and colds, that she dares not venture out unless the
                     weather be perfectly clear. No one expects her to live more than a few years.
                     My mother died of consumption; I have a marked predisposition to that fatal
                     disease; and I need not tell you that your lungs are peculiarly sensitive. In
                     fact, no observant mind for a moment doubts this law."
                  "Then to be born of consumptive parents is to have an inevitable entailment of
                     disease and early death."
                  "No, that does not follow.
                  "But, if I understand aright, scarcely an instance occurs in which life is not
                     materially shortened."
                  "That is, in almost all cases, the fault of each individual who inherits a
                     peculiar liability to pulmonary affections. If I had, from the time I became
                     mistress of my own actions, carefully guarded my health, and not increased my
                     natural predisposition to this disease, but rather overcome it, I would have
                     escaped, and you would have been born with lungs less liable to inflammation
                     than mine; and then, if you had, with equal care, preserved your health, your
                     children would be born still less predisposed to consumption; and in your
                     grandchildren, or at least in their children, were the same care for health
                     observed, the tendency to this fatal disease would be lost. What a blessing
                     this would be, I need not say! If such care had been exercised by our parents,
                     they would have bestowed upon us a legacy far more desirable and far more
                     valuable than silver and gold. From this you may see that no young person has a
                     right to neglect her healthâ€”for in doing so, she sacrifices the happiness of
                     her children, in entailing upon them the diseases that her own conduct has
                     brought upon herself; and, it may be, so enervates her own constitution, that
                     she is unable properly to discharge her duty to them. Early death is, too
                     often, the fatal consequence that ensues, where a liability to consumption
                     exists, and the mother is torn from her little ones at the very time when they
                     are most bound up in her affections, and most need her care."
                  A gush of tears was Margaret's answer to this. She realized, in imagination,
                     too vividly the distressing picture which her mother had drawn, and felt too
                     seriously her own irreparable folly.
               
               
                  SCENE THIRD.
                  TEN years have passed since the scene last introduced. It is in the pleasant
                     month of June, and the day is nearly
                     at its close. We will bring the reader into a chamber, where, elevated on
                     pillows, reclines a mother, whose pale, thin face, large bright eyes, and
                     laboured, almost gasping respiration, tell too plainly that her time upon earth
                     is but brief. From great weakness, cough, and a gradual decay, she has been
                     suffering for many years, and now, the feeble organism by which her mind has
                     done its work in the natural world, is no longer able to act against the
                     influent life of the soul, and is about to be laid aside, and the spirit ascend
                     into the world of spirits. There would be nothing in this act of laying off the
                     material body, to sadden the feelings, had the full time come, and all life's
                     duties been performed. But, alas! in the instance we are about to contemplate,
                     this is not so. Life's highest duties have but just begun.
                  Five human beings are in that chamber, besides the dying mother. The husband
                     and father, and four little ones, the oldest but nine years of age. Upon these
                     pledges of a pure and holy love, the mother's eyes are fixed with an earnest,
                     tearful intensity.
                  "Oh! I cannot leave you all!" she murmured in her husband's ear; "I cannot give
                     up my children to stranger-hands! Who can love them and care for them like a
                     mother? Oh, no! God is merciful, and will not take me from my children."
                  But, even while she thus gave utterance to the feelings that were overpowering
                     her, her breath grew feebler and her pulse lower.
                  "Bring me my babe," she said, in a quick, earnest voice, as if she felt the
                     hand of the destroyer laid coldly upon her heart, and was conscious that her
                     moments upon earth were few.
                  An infant but a few months old, lying in a calm deep slumber, was brought into
                     the room and laid on a pillow beside her. It was a beautiful babeâ€”pure and
                     sweet as innocence itself. Long and earnestly did the mother look into its
                     passionless face, a smile of love half forming itself around her lips, while
                     the tears fell slowly from her eyes, and rested like dewdrops upon the infant's
                     cheeks. The falling tears awakened the babe; its bright blue eyes opened,
                     smiles dimpled over its cherub face, and its hands were lifted in gladness at
                     beholding the countenance that was bent lovingly over it. Wildly did the mother
                     clasp her infant to her bosom, while sobs convulsed her whole frame, and her
                     moans of anguish filled the chamber. The nurse stepped forward quickly to
                     remove the babe from her arms, but she refused to release itâ€”binding it still
                     more firmly to her breast. But, in a few moments her arms relaxed; the babe
                     fell gently upon the pillow from which she had lifted it, and the mother sank
                     back mute, unconscious, pulseless!"
                  "Margaret!" exclaimed her husband, springing quickly forward, and bending down over her; but
                     she heard him not.
                  "Mother! mother!" called, in tearful alarm and anguish, the oldest child,
                     clambering upon the bed; but the mother's ear was deaf. Never again would it
                     thrill at the sweet sounds of children's voices. It heard not the moans and
                     cries of anguish that filled the chamber whence the spirit had fled for ever,
                     leaving behind its clayey tenement, cold, rigid, and senseless!
                  Thus, in her very prime, was this young wife and mother snatched away from
                     those who loved her with the deepest and purest love that warms the human
                     breast. Thus was she torn from the babe in whom her very life seemed bound up;
                     and thus was the fountain that nature had opened for the infant's sustenance,
                     closed for ever. With seeming justice might one, who saw nothing beyond that
                     chamber of death, with all its unexpressed and inexpressible anguish, charge
                     with cruelty the great Disposer of events; but we, who have seen the causes to
                     these sad consequences, are by no means surprised at the painful result.
                  "You have no right to abuse your health, Margaret!" If, when this warning
                     admonition was given with so much earnestness by her mother, Margaret Ellis
                     could have looked into the future, how would she have shuddered at the scenes
                     we have just contemplated with pain! But the future is wisely hidden from us,
                     and reason given to be our guide. If we hearken to the voice of reason, all
                     will be well; but if we disregard its admonitions, pain and suffering will
                     inevitably follow. Sad, indeed, as we have seen, were the consequences that
                     followed her abuse of health. But they stopped not here. In the bodies of her
                     children she has sown the seeds of the same fatal disease that robbed her of
                     life, and with a higher degree of vitality than she received them from her
                     mother.
                  The whole picture is one that fills the mind with sadness. Utterly disregarding
                     all the warnings she received, Margaret Ellis, in the pursuit of her own
                     pleasures, destroyed her health, and then assumed the high and important
                     relations of a wife and mother, without the ability to discharge fully the
                     obligations thus taken upon herself. Just as she is surrounded with children
                     who need all her love and careâ€”just at the time when she becomes her husband's
                     very second self, and absolutely necessary to his happinessâ€”the consequences of
                     her folly reach their climax, and she dies!
                  We draw the curtain over this scene. We wish to contemplate it no longer. To do
                     so could not possibly furnish a stronger incentive to right conduct than must
                     be felt by all who need to be more careful than they are in regard to
                     health.
               
               
                  
                  THE SEQUEL.
                  A LOVELY girl, just entering her eighteenth year, sits by an open window,
                     reading. She is deeply absorbed in her book, and notices not that the day is
                     declining, and the air rapidly falling in temperature. Even the long sunny
                     ringlets, that the freshening breeze, even and anon, blows across her book,
                     convey to her mind no warning. Still she reads on, until aroused by an earnest
                     and familiar voice.
                  "My dear Florence, you mustn't sit by that open window! It might be your death!
                     Don't you perceive that the air is much colder than it was an hour ago?"
                  "So it is," answered the young girl, moving from the window, and slightly
                     shivering as she felt a chill run over her body. "I was so interested in what I
                     was reading, that I did not notice the change."
                  As she arose and walked across the floor, she exhibited a tall and slender
                     person, with a narrow chest, long and thin neck, and fine white skin. She was
                     very beautiful, and her father's eyes rested upon her with pride, not unmingled
                     with anxiety,â€”the last of four children, two of whom had died very young, and
                     the third, after she had attained the age of womanhood and was just on the eve
                     of marriage. Florence was as dear to her father as the apple of his eye.
                     Inheriting from her mother, who had died many years before, a high degree of
                     susceptibility to disease of the lungs, a disease that had snatched her sister
                     away in the very spring-time of life, it was no wonder that her father loved
                     her tenderly, at the same time that he felt most anxious in regard to her
                     health.
                  "You are not well, Florence," said her father, that evening, after having sat
                     for some time with his eyes fixed upon her as she was reading.
                  Florence drew herself up, and pressed her hand against her side.
                  "No, father," she replied, "I do not feel very well."
                  "What is the matter?"
                  "I don't know; except that I feel hot here," laying her hand upon her breast,
                     "and cannot take a long breath without pain."
                  "You have taken cold. I was afraid of it, when I saw you sitting by the window,
                     with the air blowing over you so freshly," said Mr. Cranston, (that was the
                     father's name), manifesting a good deal of concern. "You had better go to bed,
                     and I will step round and see the doctor."
                  "I will go to bed, father," returned Florence, "but there is no reason in the
                     world why you should see the doctor. I suppose I have taken some cold, but
                     shall be well enough by morning."
                  
                  Mr. Cranston said no more. But the moment his daughter withdrew, after bidding
                     him a tender good-night, he took up his hat, and, leaving the house, moved down
                     the street with hasty steps. He found the doctor, at whose office he called,
                     within.
                  "Is any thing the matter?" asked the physician, for he saw, by the expression
                     of Mr. Cranston's face, that he was alarmed about something.
                  "Oh, no, nothing serious, I hope," was replied. "When I came home this
                     afternoon, I found Florence sitting by the open window, with the air, which had
                     fallen several degrees in a few hours, blowing freshly over her. As she moved
                     away, on my speaking to her, I noticed a slight shudder pass over her, as if
                     she had been struck with a sudden chill. To-night she complains of burning in
                     her breast, and cannot take a long breath without pain. I suppose it is nothing
                     serious, but the slightest cold alarms me. You know, doctor, I have good cause
                     for feeling as I do."
                  This last sentence was spoken in a saddened voice.
                  "Oh, no, I don't suppose it is any thing serious," the doctor replied, speaking
                     cheerfully. "But in one naturally predisposed to inflammation of the chest and
                     diseases of the lungs, as she is, slight colds, if neglected, may prove
                     troublesome. It is better, therefore, always to meet the enemy in his first
                     inroads, and subdue him. Suppose I call round and see Florence?"
                  "I wish you would, doctor. I think it will be much better."
                  The doctor took up his hat and accompanied Mr. Cranston home. He found Florence
                     rather worse than he had expected to find her from her father's description.
                     Her symptoms indicated very considerable inflammation in her chest, although he
                     was not able to determine its exact location. In the hope of subduing this
                     inflammation before it could do any serious injury, he applied a blister along
                     the sternum, and waited until next morning to see the effect produced by this
                     treatment. But it did not prove as salutary as he had expected. The patient
                     still complained of a pain that extended to her right shoulder, and which was
                     greatly augmented if she attempted to take a deep inspiration.
                  But it is not our intention to trace the progress of this disease. It is
                     sufficient for our purpose to say, that without any very serious or
                     long-continued illness on the part of Florence, the consequences of the cold
                     taken at the window was such an irritation of her lungsâ€”highly susceptible to
                     disease from birthâ€”as to cause the development of what are known to physicians
                     as tubercles, or little nucleÃ¦, that become in time the centres of so many
                     abscesses, and ultimately cause such a destruction of the lungs as to produce
                     death. When these are once formed, there is little, if any, hope of a cure.
                  From this period, although Florence recovered in a short time from the acute symptoms produced by
                     the cold, she never felt entirely well. In the course of a few months, a slight
                     cough, from tickling in the chest, began to show itself, which at times was
                     very troublesome. Sometimes her cheeks would be flushed, and her eyes deeply
                     brilliant; and again, paleness would overspread her countenance, and her eyes
                     become dull and almost expressionless. Her appetite also variedâ€”at times being
                     voracious, and then failing almost entirely.
                  A year had scarcely passed, before weakening night-sweats made their
                     appearance. The cough had increased, and was sometimes very severe, accompanied
                     by only a scanty, mucous expectoration. Soon after this time, however, the
                     cough became less severe, but the expectoration was fuller, and of a quality to
                     indicate too plainly that the tubercles had become abscesses, and were now
                     discharging themselves.
                  From this period, all the worst symptoms increased. In the hope of relief from
                     change of climate, Mr. Cranston took his daughter to Cuba. But this was of no
                     avail. The disease was too deeply seated for climate to have any effect. In six
                     months, he returned, hopeless and almost heart-broken. This was the last tie
                     that bound him to life. The wife of his bosom and three children had already
                     been taken from him, and now the last remaining one was about to be stricken
                     down at his side.
                  But grief and painful anxieties availed not. Death had too surely marked his
                     victim. Nor was he the only sufferer in view of this great bereavement. One
                     worthy of his daughter's best affectionsâ€”one for whom she was in every way
                     fitted to make a loving companion through lifeâ€”had won her heart. But he had a
                     rival more powerful than himselfâ€”she was not destined to be his bride, but the
                     bride of Death.
               
            
            
               THE OVERPAID CHECK.
               "I'LL tell you something, if you'll promise not to say any thing about it," said a
                  young man named Wheeler, to a fellow-clerk named Watson.
               "I'm no hand at keeping secrets," returned Watson, "so you'd better not tell
                  me."
               "Oh, yes, I will; but you mustn't say any thing about it. You know, I had a check
                  for my quarter's salary to-day."
               "Yes."
               "It was for three hundred dollars. Now, look here." And, as Wheeler spoke, he
                  opened a drawer of the desk at which he was writing, took out a small parcel of
                  bank-bills, and commenced counting them
                  over. The whole amount was eight hundred dollars.
               "There is what I received for my check," said he, in a tone and with a glance of
                  exultation.
               "Eight hundred dollars!" remarked Watson, evincing surprise.
               "Yes."
               "I thought your check called for only three hundred dollars."
               "So did I; but it seems the teller thought differently."
               "Then he overpaid your check five hundred dollars."
               "He did, and no mistake," replied Wheeler. "A'n't I lucky? No errors corrected out
                  of bank, you know."
               "But you don't intend keeping the money?"
               "Yes, I do. Suppose the check had been for eight hundred dollars, and the teller
                  had paid me but three hundredâ€”would he have rectified that error? No, indeed! It's
                  a poor rule that won't work both ways."
               "How could he have made such a mistake?"
               "Easily enough. The counter was lined with a dozen of persons waiting with their
                  checks, when I handed up mine. You know how curiously Mr. Yâ€”makes his figures;
                  it's no great wonder that there should be mistakes sometimes. Now, what figure do
                  you call that?"
               The clerk pointed to a piece of paper which lay upon the desk.
               "It is the figure three."
               "Yet one might easily enough mistake it for an eight, if in a hurry."
               "Oh, yes."
               "Just such another figure was on my check."
               "Then the teller was not so much to blame!"
               "Oh, no! The mistake is by no means a surprising one."
               "But you do not mean to take advantage of the error?"
               "I certainly do. If it had been on the other side, would he have corrected
                  it?"
               "The loss will fall upon himself."
               "I don't care where it falls; I'll get the advantage. A man doesn't meet with such
                  good luck every day."
               "Indeed, Wheeler, I think you're wrong," said his fellow-clerk, earnestly. "We
                  should never seek to secure a good to ourselves through another's loss. The teller
                  will lose five hundred dollars, unless you go forward and correct his mistake, and
                  that will be a serious matter for him. You know he has a large family."
               "Let him take better care another time; but I don't believe the bank will make him
                  lose it."
               "Even if they should not, the principle upon which you act is wrong."
               
               "That for the principle," said Wheeler, snapping his thumb and finger. "When a man
                  gets five hundred dollars in his grasp, it takes a large amount of principle to
                  get the money out again. My principle is to hold on to all I can get."
               The conversation between the two young men was interrupted at this point, and they
                  separated to attend to various duties that were required of them.
               "I hope you've thought better of it, and intend returning the five hundred dollars
                  you drew out of the bank in mistake," said Watson, when he had an opportunity to
                  speak again with Wheeler alone.
               "You're very much mistaken," was the prompt reply. "I intend no such thing. No
                  errors corrected out of bank; this is the rule, and it's as good on one side as on
                  another. The banks made the rule, and let them abide by it. Didn't this very
                  teller make a mistake of fifty dollars last winter, against a check paid to
                  Anderson & Miller, and refuse to correct it? I know a good many instances of
                  the same kind. Now I'll turn the tables on him, and he'll understand how it
                  feels."
               "You're wrong; depend upon it, you're wrong," answered Watson. "The teller refused
                  to correct the alleged mistakes, because he did not know them to be such. But you
                  know that you have received five hundred dollars, not your due, and that the loss
                  will fall upon the individual who committed the error."
               "You need not talk to me, Watson; I know what I'm about. I just wanted five
                  hundred dollars, and the money has come in the nick of time."
               Wheeler was in earnest, as his conduct proved. He kept the money, notwithstanding
                  several persons, who came to know of the fact, urged him to do what was right; but
                  it proved of no benefit to him, for he lost it all, and three hundred dollars
                  besides, in an adventure made in one of his employer's ships, before the year was
                  out.
               About this time, the firm in whose service he was discovered that a system of
                  peculation had been going on in their establishment, but were unable to trace the
                  wrong to any particular clerk among the large number employed. Whole pieces of
                  fine and costly goods disappeared mysteriously, and, on various occasions, the
                  cash proved to be unaccountably short. Under these circumstances, a council of the
                  firm was called, and the matter taken up seriously.
               "I'm afraid," said one, during this interview, "that the young man in whom we have
                  reposed so much confidence is not innocent in this matter."
               "You don't mean Wheeler?" inquired a second member of the house, exhibiting marked
                  surprise.
               "I do," was answered.
               "Impossible!"
               "So I would have said yesterday; but I heard something this morning, that has
                  altogether changed my opinion of him."
               
               "What is it?"
               "You remember the adventure upon which he lost so heavily?"
               "Yes."
               "Where do you think a large part of the money with which he bought the goods sent
                  out came from?"
               "He saved it from his salary, I presume."
               "I believed the same; but now I learn that on one of the checks we gave him for a
                  quarter's salary, the teller overpaid him five hundred dollars."
               "And he kept it?"
               "Yes."
               "Then he is not honest."
               "Of course, he is not. The act was just as dishonest as stealing."
               "But are you certain of this?"
               "John Phillips told me so this morning."
               Phillips was a clerk in the establishment, and the real delinquent in the matter
                  under investigation. He had become apprized of the act of Wheeler, and rightly
                  judged that to give a hint of it to his employers would turn their attention from
                  him and fix his guilt upon another, if his peculations were made the subject of
                  investigation, as he had every reason to believe was about being the case.
               "Can we believe him?"
               "He says Andrew Watson knows it to be the case."
               Watson, being questioned, fully confirmed the fact. Other evidence was added,
                  establishing the matter beyond a doubt.
               "It won't do to retain him in our employment," said one of the firm.
               "No. But who would have dreamed of suspecting him? It is well we have not yet
                  carried out our intention of establishing a house in Cincinnati. With him at the
                  head of it, as was designed, we might have sustained a heavy loss."
               Not the slightest evidence appeared against Wheeler. Still, there was the fact of
                  his dishonesty in the matter of the check before the eyes of his employers, who
                  were suffering loss from some one about their establishment. Their determination,
                  after long debating the matter, and viewing it upon every side, was to inform him
                  that they no longer had need of his services. Nothing could have more astounded
                  the young man than did this announcement when it was made. His inquiry into the
                  cause of his dismissal was not answered truly: something about the necessity of
                  reducing expenses was alleged; and that was about all the satisfaction he
                  received.
               Being a most excellent salesman, and in every way competent to take charge of
                  business, Wheeler received the offer of a situation at a thousand dollars a year,
                  as soon as it was known that he had left his old place. This offer he accepted,
                  although the salary was two hundred
                  dollars less than the one he had been receiving.
               In the house from which he was dismissed, Wheeler had been employed for ten years;
                  he entered it as a lad of fifteen, and had always acted so as to secure the
                  confidence and respect of every member of the firm. His expectations in life, so
                  far as business matters were concerned, did not go beyond this house. A branch in
                  Cincinnati had been for some time under contemplation, and it was understood that
                  he was to have an interest in it, and it was to have an interest in it, and it was
                  to be under his charge. His disappointment and mortification were, therefore,
                  extreme. He knew that the cause assigned for his discharge was not the real one,
                  for business had never been more active; and had he possessed a doubt on this
                  subject, it would have been removed by the fact, that a few weeks after he left
                  his old place, another clerk was engaged.
               This reaction upon the young man's error, although he was ignorant of the fact
                  that it was such a reaction, sobered his feelings very much. We say ignorant of
                  the fact, still a thought of what he had done would occasionally cross his mind,
                  and stir a latent suspicion of some connection between the over paid check and his
                  loss of favour in the eyes of his old employers. The effect of this was to awaken
                  a feeling of regret for having kept the money, which became, at length, so
                  distinct an impression as to trouble him.
               About a year after Wheeler had left his old place, the merchant in whose
                  employment he was, said to him one day, on coming in from the bank, where he had
                  been to attend to some businessâ€”"I'm sorry to hear bad news about Gardiner, the
                  first teller in our bank."
               "Ah! What is it?" inquired Wheeler.
               "He has been detected in several false entries."
               "It can't be possible! I have always believed him to be a very honest man."
               "So have I. In fact, the circumstances are such as to show the existence of strong
                  temptations."
               "How much has he taken from the bank?"
               "Only five hundred dollars have been discovered; and that, he says, is the full
                  amount abstracted from the funds of the institution, and I am disposed to believe
                  him."
               "What could have possessed him to do so?"
               "Very peculiar circumstances. He has a large family, and his expenses have been
                  fully up to his income. About two years ago, he says that he overpaid to some one,
                  five hundred dollars, which the institution required him to make good; it was
                  deducted from his salary, at the rate of one hundred and twenty-five dollars a
                  quarter. In the mean time, debt became the unavoidable consequence, and under its
                  harassment, and goaded by the thought that the bank was unjust in laying the
                  entire burden of the error upon him, when he was so little able to bear it, he yielded to the temptation, and made
                  five false entries in the book, each for one hundred dollars. This is his account
                  of the matter, and I believe and pity him."
               "What course will the bank pursue?" inquired Wheeler, in so changed a voice that
                  his employer looked at him curiously.
               "Gardiner has been removed from his place, and his securities released. The
                  directors, under the circumstances, voted to let the loss fall upon the bank; but
                  while they pitied the young man, they could not retain him in so responsible a
                  situation as the one he had occupied."
               "Oh, dear!" fell from the lips of Wheeler, in a tone of distress, that was far
                  more deeply-grounded in his heart than the merchant dreamed.
               "I don't envy the feelings of him who received the temporary benefit from that
                  poor clerk's error, when he comes to hear of the sad consequence that has
                  followed," said Wheeler's employer, as he turned from the young man. How the words
                  stunned the ears that heard them!
               For days and weeks, little else but the thought of Gardiner's dismissal from the
                  bank was in the mind of Wheeler. Most sincerely did he repent of what he had done,
                  and with repentance came the wish to make restitution. While in this state of
                  mind, Gardiner came into the store to see his employer and lay before him an offer
                  to go into business which he had received. In order to form the connection, he
                  must have a capital of five hundred dollars; but he had not a cent, was out of
                  employment, and his family dependent for their daily bread upon the bounty of a
                  relative.
               "The offer is a very good one," said the merchant. "But can you furnish the
                  capital?"
               "No," was replied, "that is the difficulty."
               "How do you think of obtaining it?"
               "I know of no resource, unless those who do not think me really dishonest at
                  heart, and who pity my misfortune, help me. Can I depend upon you for any
                  aid?"
               "I'm afraid not," replied the merchant. "I have need of every dollar it is
                  possible for me to command."
               Gardiner went away, looking sad and hopeless. Wheeler did not hear what he had
                  said, but he was painfully affected by the expression of his countenance.
               "Poor fellow!" said the merchant, after Gardiner had retired. "I pity him, but I
                  can't risk my money on one who has proved himself dishonest, even though it were
                  under strong temptation. He has a capital offer to go into business, if he had
                  only five hundred dollars to invest, but he will find it difficult to raise that
                  sum; at least, from people who know any thing of his short-comings while in the
                  bank."
               Wheeler heard this, but said nothing. He was naturally fond of money, and ardently desired to
                  accumulate property. He made it a rule never to spend over half of his salary,
                  and, in consequence, always had money laid up in bank, invested in good stocks, or
                  accumulating by means of such business operations as he could enter into without
                  interfering with his regular duties as a clerk. His ultimate intention was to
                  commence business himself as soon as he had saved about five thousand dollars,
                  unless a good connection in some well-established house offered before that time;
                  towards this object he had already accumulated nearly two thousand dollars.
                  Although he had lost, in an unsuccessful adventure, the five hundred dollars
                  obtained through the teller's error, yet the thought of restitution came into his
                  mind; he felt that Gardiner's misfortune lay at his doorâ€”that he had injured him
                  beyond all hope of full reparation. But his strong love of money, and ardent
                  desire to accumulate a sufficient sum of money to justify him in commencing
                  business for himself, arose in opposition to the honest and generous impulse. Then
                  came a warm debate in his mind between selfishness and just principles, which went
                  on for several days, during which time he was much disturbed. To restore the five
                  hundred dollars was to put off for at least a year beyond the time when he
                  expected to get into business, the period he so anxiously wished to arrive, and
                  his heart sank at the thought. Then came the question whether the money, if
                  restored, should go to Gardiner or the bank. This was soon settled, however, on
                  the side of the former, against whom the wrong had been done, and who had been so
                  great a sufferer in consequence.
               It was nearly two weeks before the mind of Wheeler came to a full decision; it was
                  in favour of justice. After deciding, he acted quickly. Five hundred dollars worth
                  of stock was sold, and the money sent to Gardiner in a letter, to which, of
                  course, there was no signature. He then felt more comfortable in mind, especially
                  as Gardiner immediately closed with the pending offer, and came into a business
                  that, while it gave him a comfortable living for the present, promised well for
                  the future.
               A few months after this, his old employers were waited upon by the merchant whom
                  he was serving as a clerk.
               "I wish," said the latter, "to ask you one or two questions about Wheeler. I have
                  thought, for some time, of offering him an interest in my business; but before
                  doing so, it seemed but right that I should see you and ask the reason why you did
                  not retain him in your employment. It could not have been for want of ability or
                  attention to business."
               "No. Few young men have his capacity," was replied.
               "Then you had a reason for dispensing with his services beyond this?"
               
               "We certainly had."
               "May I be permitted to inquire what it was?"
               "Yes; and under the circumstances, we cannot withhold a candid answer. You know
                  that Gardiner, the paying-teller in theâ€”Bank, lost his place for abstracting five
                  hundred dollars to make good his own loss in consequence of having overpaid that
                  sum on a check."
               "Yes; and I have pitied him very much. His was rather a hard case. The scoundrel
                  who took advantage of his mistake, if known, should meet with the execration of
                  all honest men."
               "We are sorry to say that Wheeler was the man who drew the check."
               "Wheeler?"
               "Yes. On a check of three hundred dollars, received for his quarter's salary,
                  Gardiner paid him by mistake eight hundred, and he kept the money."
               "And for this you discharged him from your house."
               "Yes, as soon as we were apprized of the fact, which was nearly a year after it
                  occurred."
               "Did you tell him the reason?"
               "No; we didn't care to do that."
               "He's not an honest man," said the merchant, on learning this; "and, of course,
                  not worthy of confidence. So far from connecting myself with him in business, I
                  shall hardly deem it prudent to retain him about me, even in his present
                  capacity."
               And on this view he acted. From that time, Wheeler's situation was rendered so
                  unpleasant, that in the course of a few months he gave it up and sought another
                  place.
               Again he had felt the reaction of his error, without comprehending from whence the
                  effect proceeded. He did not know how much he had lost in seeking to gain five
                  hundred dollars dishonestly.
               Tenderly attached had Wheeler been for two or three years to a beautiful and
                  affectionate young lady, whose connections embraced many families of wealth and
                  influence. Her name was Adeline Burton. As her uncle, with whom she resided, was a
                  man of some property, and she was living in a style of more elegance than Wheeler
                  could support, he had delayed urging a marriage until he could get into business.
                  But he saw one young man after another, by far less capable and experienced than
                  himself, selected by men of capital as partners, or introduced into firms to which
                  they had formerly held a clerk's relation, while he was passed by most
                  unaccountably. A feeling of discouragement came over him; he saw no light in the
                  future. Anxious to lead to the altar the one he loved, he yet hesitated; for he
                  could not think of removing her from her pleasant home into one at all inferior,
                  or wanting in the elegances with which she was familiar.
               While hesitating whether to ask his betrothed, for such was the relation Adeline
                  bore to him, to name an early day for
                  their marriage, he observed a sudden change in her manner towards him. While
                  pondering this strange circumstance, he was astounded by the receipt of all his
                  letters and little souvenirs, and a cold request to have hers returned. Indignant
                  at such faithlessness, he sent back what she desired, without a word of reply,
                  either verbal or written. But the circumstances seemed to stun him. He had loved
                  Adeline with a most earnest affection, and in all his dreams of his future life,
                  her image had been beautifully blended. The blow was a heavy one, and saddened his
                  heart for life. Soon after, he left the East and removed to a Western city.
               Ten years had elapsed, and then Wheeler came back for the first time since he had
                  gone away. On the little sum he had saved from his earnings, he had commenced a
                  small business in a far-off Western town. Gradually this grew into importance, and
                  now it became necessary to visit the East, in order to purchase a stock of goods.
                  Hitherto he had supplied himself either in Cincinnati or Pittsburg. In the old
                  place, he found every thing changed. Scarcely a familiar countenance met him as he
                  walked the streets, and in the business portions of the city only here and there
                  did he observe the "signs" of other times. Gardiner, the once unfortunate
                  bank-teller, had become a prosperous merchant, and was considered to be worth
                  fifty or sixty thousand dollars. This fact he learned with pleasure.
               Wheeler did not ask for Adeline. He could not trust himself to speak of her to any
                  one, for not yet had her beautiful image faded from his memory. Once truly
                  beloved, and never proved unworthy of his heart's best affections, he had not been
                  able to forget her; yet, having been rejected without a reason, he had never felt
                  inclined to ask for one, nor to seek a renewal of the old relations. For all he
                  had learned to the contrary, she had become, years before, the bride of
                  another.
               After remaining a few days in the city and making some purchases, he prepared to
                  leave for the West. On the day previous to his intended departure, while passing
                  along the street, he came suddenly upon Adeline Burton. The lady started, paused
                  slightly, and then went hurriedly on. Her face was thin, and wore a look of
                  suffering and resignation; she turned very pale when she saw him.
               Wheeler was deeply agitated by this apparition. He did not leave the city on the
                  next day, as he had intended; it was impossible for him to go now, until he had
                  obtained an interview with Adeline, who had not, as he learned, given her vows to
                  another. After lying awake nearly all night, thinking over the course best to
                  pursue, he finally determined to see her uncle, and plainly ask the reason why
                  Adeline had, years before, broken the engagement into which she had entered. Upon
                  this resolution he acted. The uncle received him with chilling formality; but, not repulsed by this, Wheeler came
                  at once to the object of his visit.
               "Ten years ago, sir," said he, calmly, "your niece, to whom I was engaged in
                  marriage, broke her contract with me, and without assigning any reason. I asked
                  none, and to this day have remained ignorant of her motives; but I now feel a wish
                  to know them. Will you do me the justice to give me the information I seek?"
               "Certainly," replied the uncle; "if you desire to learn what influenced Adeline, I
                  see no reason why you should not be gratified."
               "Speak, then; I am prepared to hear."
               "You remember Gardiner, the teller in theâ€”Bank?" said the uncle.
               A deep crimson instantly covered the face of Wheeler, and his eyes remained for
                  some moments cast upon the floor. When he looked up, his countenance was
                  composed.
               "Yes," he replied, "I remember Gardiner very well, for I have cause. I understand
                  it all now. Adeline was told that I unjustly withheld from the bank five hundred
                  dollars received in mistake?"
               The uncle bowed gravely.
               "And for this she rejected me?"
               "She did, and I must say with good cause."
               "Perhaps so," said Wheeler. "Yet may not a man repent of a wrong act?"
               "Oh, yes. But we will judge of the quality of this repentance by his efforts to
                  repair the injury he has wrought."
               "True. And now will you do me the justice to see Gardiner, and ask him if he did
                  not, more than ten years ago, receive from an unknown hand the sum of five hundred
                  dollars?"
               "Then you restored the money?"
               "I did. But see him; put the question to him. Then go to theâ€”Bank, and ask the
                  cashier if, seven years ago, he did not receive a letter from the West, covering a
                  remittance of five hundred dollars to be placed to the credit of Gardiner, in
                  liquidation of the deficit remaining in his account."
               "That would be restitution twofold," said the uncle of Adeline.
               "And it has been made," returned Wheeler, speaking with much warmth. "But do me
                  the justice to prove the truth of what I have said. Tomorrow, I will see you
                  again."
               Saying this, Wheeler arose and retired. On the next day, when he called again upon
                  the uncle of Adeline, his reception was very different. His hand was grasped
                  warmly the instant he came in.
               "I have seen both Gardiner and the cashier," said the uncle, "and it is all as you
                  say. Gardiner, having done well in business, offered, some years ago, to make good
                  his short-comings at the bank, but your remittance had anticipated him; and he now
                  sends you this check for five hundred dollars as a return of the loan you made him ten years
                  ago."
               "I cannot receive it," was the prompt reply of Wheeler.
               "But Gardiner will not feel happy if you refuse."
               "And I will not feel happy if I accept. But let us waive that now; there is
                  something else nearer my heart. It was for this cause that Adeline turned from
                  me?"
               "It was."
               "Has she loved another since?"
               "No. She has received three or four advantageous offers, but rejected them
                  all."
               "Do you object to my seeing her again?"
               "No. You committed a grievous error; but you have seen that it was wrong, and have
                  repaired the injury to the best of your ability. None can ask more than this. All
                  are liable to do wrong, yet few sincerely repent."
               "Are you willing to inform Adeline, before I see her, of all you have just
                  learned?"
               "That has already been done."
               "It has?"
               "Yes."
               "Will she see me?"
               "I will ask her, if you desire it."
               "This evening, I will call at your house," said Wheeler. "Inform Adeline of my
                  wish to see her, and tell her, that since the unhappy hour she turned from me, I
                  have not ceased to think and pray for her."
               That evening, Wheeler called, as he proposed to do. After sending up his name, he
                  sat awaiting the appearance of either Adeline or her uncle for nearly five
                  minutes. Then he heard footsteps on the stairs. A few moments of suspense, and the
                  loved one of many years entered, leaning upon the arm of her relative. Her
                  countenance was pale, yet in her eyes was the light of other times. Wheeler
                  stepped quickly forward to meet her, and she received his extended hand, and
                  returned its warm pressure. While they yet stood, mutely gazing upon each other,
                  the uncle retired, and they were left alone. What passed between them, we will not
                  record. Enough, that two weeks afterwards, Adeline was on the way to a new home in
                  the West.
            
            
               
               THE TWO ACTS; OR, "THEY HAVE THEIR REWARD."
               "NO, indeed! I shall do no such thing," said Mrs. Lionel to her husband, who had
                  come home with the intelligence that a cousin of his, a widow, had died suddenly,
                  and left a little girl, three years old, whom he proposed that his wife should
                  adopt and raise as her ownâ€”they having no children. But she gave a decided
                  negative on the spot.
               "She is a sweet, interesting child," urged Mr. Lionel. "You will soon get attached
                  to her, and be more than repaid, in the new affection awakened in you heart, for
                  all the care and trouble she may occasion."
               "It is of no use to talk to me, Mr. Lionel," returned the lady, in a positive tone
                  of voice. "I know all about the care and trouble, and am not willing to take it
                  upon myself. As I have no children of my own, I am not disposed to take the burden
                  of other people's. So it is useless for you to press this subject; for I will
                  never consent to what you propose."
               "If you feel in that way, I shall certainly not urge the matter," said her
                  husband. "Though, as far as I am concerned, it would give me great pleasure to
                  adopt Aggy, who is a charming little creature. I wish you could see her."
               "I have no particular desire. All children are alike to me. As to the beauty, that
                  is a poor compensation for the trouble. So I must beg to be excused."
               Mr. Lionel said no more on the subject. He was exceedingly fond of children, and
                  never ceased to regret that he had none of his own.
               In two or three instances before, he had endeavoured to prevail upon his wife to
                  adopt a child; but she had, each time, firmly declined. She had very little
                  affection for children herself, and was not willing to take the care and trouble
                  that she saw would necessarily be involved in the adoption of a child. The little
                  girl who, by the death of his cousin, had been left homeless and apparently
                  friendless, was a sweet young creature, whom to look upon was to love. Mr. Lionel
                  had never seen her without a warming of his heart toward her, and a secret wish
                  that she were his own instead of another's. The moment he heard of his cousin's
                  death, he determined to adopt Agnes, or Aggy, as she was called, provided his wife
                  were willing. But Mrs. Lionel was not willing. She was too selfish to love any
                  thing out of herself. A thought of the child's goodâ€”of giving a home to the
                  homelessâ€”of being a mother to the
                  motherlessâ€”never crossed her mind. She only thought of the trouble the little
                  orphan would give.
               The insuperable difficulty in the way of adopting Aggy as his own, did not destroy
                  the interest which Mr. Lionel felt in her. He considered it his duty to see that
                  she was provided with a good home, and was willing to be at the cost of her
                  maintenance, if necessary. His first thought had been to adopt the child, and
                  until that was understood to be out of the question, he had thought of nothing
                  else in regard to her. How she was to be disposed of, now that his wife had
                  definitely settled the matter against him, became a new subject of reflection.
                  After due deliberation, he concluded to see a distant relative on the subject,
                  with whom, since his marriage, he had held but little familiar intercourse,
                  although he had entertained for her a high respect. The reason of this was the
                  cold, proud, unsocial temper of his wife, who rather looked down upon his
                  relatives, because their standing in society was not, as she considered it, quite
                  as high as hers had been and still was. Necessarily, such a disposition in his
                  wife would prevent intimate social intercourse between Mr. Lionel and his
                  relatives, notwithstanding his regard for them might continue as high as before
                  his marriage.
               The relative to whom reference has just been made was a lady whose husband, a very
                  estimable man, was in moderately good circumstances. They had three children of
                  their own, the youngest of which was nearly ten years of age. From his
                  appreciation of Mrs. Wellford's character, Mr. Lionel, who, from thinking of Aggy
                  as his adopted child, began to love her almost as much as if she were really his
                  own, felt a strong desire that she should take the orphan. He had not seen her for
                  a couple of years when he called upon her to talk about the matter. A little to
                  his surprise, Mrs. Wellford, when she met him in the parlour, entered leading Aggy
                  by the hand.
               "Dear little creature!" said he, taking the child in his arms and kissing her, as
                  soon as he had shaken hands with Mrs. Wellford. "I am glad to see you in such good
                  hands. It is about this very child, Mary," he added, "that I have come to talk
                  with you. What is to be done with her?"
               "I don't know," returned Mrs. Wellford. "She must have a home somewhere among us.
                  The dear child! Any body could love her. Have you thought of taking her?"
               "If I were to consult my own feelings and wishes, I should adopt her as my own
                  child immediately. But I am not at liberty to do this, and therefore must not
                  think about it. I am willing, however, to be at the entire cost of her maintenance
                  and education, if you will undertake the care of her. What I can do, I will do
                  with all my heart."
               "We have already talked seriously about adding ing Aggy to our little household," replied Mrs.
                  Wellford. "And if no one else offers to do so, we will keep her, and do for her
                  the same as if she were our own. It will bring more care and anxiety for me,
                  which, as my health is not good, will be felt; but if not better provided for, it
                  will be my duty to take the place of her mother, and I will assume the office
                  cheerfully."
               "But at my charge," said Mr. Lionel.
               "No," replied Mrs. Wellford. "A mother accepts no pay for her duty. It is a labour
                  of love, and brings its own sweet reward. Though Providence has not given us
                  wealth, yet we have enough, and I think as much to spare as this dear child will
                  need. For your kind wishes and intentions for Aggy, I will thank you in her stead.
                  I thought, perhaps, as you had no children, that you might wish to adopt her; but
                  as this cannot be, it will doubtless fall to our lot."
               Mr. Lionel went home feeling less satisfied with his wife's spirit and temperâ€”so
                  strongly contrasted as it was with that of Mrs. Wellfordâ€”than he had felt for a
                  long time.
               "She will have her reward," he murmured to himself, "and, as she said, justly, it
                  will be sweet." This was in allusion to Mrs. Wellford, who had called the mother's
                  duty she was about assuming, a labour of love.
               Little Aggy scarcely felt the loss of her parent. The love she had borne her
                  mother was transferred to her aunt, as Mrs. Wellford was called, so early that no
                  void was left in her heart. It took but a little while for each member of the
                  family to feel that Aggy had a right to be among them, and for Mr. and Mrs.
                  Wellford to love her as their own child.
               Years rolled by, and brought many unlooked-for changes both to Mrs. Lionel and
                  Mrs. Wellford. Both had been subjected to afflictions and reversesâ€”the severest,
                  perhaps, that ordinarily fall to the lot of anyâ€”for both were widows, and both
                  friendless and poor. As for Mrs. Wellford, she had not only lost her husband, but
                  all her children were taken, and she was left alone in the world with the orphan
                  Aggy. But she, grown into a lovely young woman, nestled closer to her side and
                  into her very bosom; though not with a helpless, but in a sustaining spirit.
                  Death, though he had robbed Mrs. Wellford of much, had still left her much.
                  Bereaved as she had been, she was neither lonely not sad. How different was the
                  case of Mrs. Lionel! After the death of her husband, and the total loss of her
                  property, she fell back at once from her advance position in the social rank, into
                  neglect, obscurity, and want. For the very means of subsistence, exertion became
                  necessary. But what could she do for a living, who had, in her whole life, done
                  scarcely a useful thingâ€”who had been little better than a drone in the social
                     hive? Nothing! Or, if there was
                  small ability, there was pride enough remaining to prevent its exercise.
               After her husband's death, which followed shortly after the reverses that stripped
                  him of all worldly possessions, Mrs. Lionel retired into the family of a poor
                  relative, who had been little thought of in brighter days, and who, although she
                  did not wish to receive her, could not close her door in her face. A sad spectacle
                  she was. Shut up in the little chamber that was assigned her, she never went out,
                  and only met the family she was burdening with her presence at the table, and then
                  with an aspect so gloomy and reserved, as to throw a chill over the feelings of
                  all.
               For a short period, Mrs. Lionel paid a small sum for her board, but no very long
                  time passed before all her money was exhausted, and she became absolutely
                  dependent upon a poor woman distantly related to her, whose only means of support
                  was her personal labour and that of her daughter.
               After the death of her husband and children, Mrs. Wellford, who was left quite as
                  poor as Mrs. Lionel, began to look around her for some means of securing an income
                  for herself and Agnes, whom she loved, now that all the rest were gone, with a
                  tenderness that equalled the sum of her love for all. But what to do, was a
                  difficult thing to determine. As a young girl, her education had been very plain;
                  she could not, therefore, resort to teaching in any branch, for she had not the
                  requisite ability. Sewing always gave her a severe pain in the breast and side, so
                  that whatever might be her skill in needlework, she was precluded from resorting
                  to it as a means of obtaining money.
               "I think," said she to Agnes, after looking at the subject in every possible
                  light, "that there is but one thing left for me to do."
               "What is that, aunt?" inquired Agnes.
               "Taking a few boarders. I could attend to them."
               "It will be very hard work," suggested the niece, "too hard for you. No, no, aunt,
                  that will not do; look what a slave's life Mrs. Minturn has. Don't think of
                  it."
               "I must do something, you know, Aggy dear; in a little while, all our money will
                  be gone. I have thought of every thing, but my mind comes back to this at last. I
                  don't like the thought of it, but it is right for me to exert myself, and I must
                  do so without a murmur."
               "Haven't you yet thought of any thing that I can do?" asked Agnes, in a cheerful
                  voice. "I am sure that I can do something," she added, confidently; "and I am
                  younger, and have better health than you have."
               "I cannot think, my dear child," said Mrs. Wellford, with much earnestness in her
                  voice, "of your being exposed to the world's rough contact; you are too
                  young."
               
               "The contact you seem so to dread cannot hurt me, aunt," returned Agnes. "To the
                  pure, all things are pure. If I have in me a right spirit, the world cannot hurt
                  me."
               "But I cannot bear the thought of seeing you, in the very spring-time of life,
                  when all along your path should grow up flowers to fill the air with perfume,
                  chained like a slave to the car of labour. No, no, Aggy, it must not be; I can do
                  all that is required. If I fail, then it will be time enough to call upon you for
                  aid."
               Pride as well as affection reigned in the breast of Mrs. Wellford. She could not
                  bear the thought of seeing Agnes engaged in any kind of labour for money. She was
                  fully capable of giving instruction in many things, and of securing thereby a fair
                  income; but her aunt would not hear to her seeking for employment.
               "Aunt is wrong," said Agnes to herself, when alone, soon after the interview, in
                  which Mrs. Wellford declared it as her belief that the only thing left for her to
                  do was to take a few boarders. "I ought not to see her do this." She sat
                  thoughtful for a few moments, and then added aloudâ€”"And I will not see her do it.
                  I have received every thing from her, and now is the time for me to make some
                  return. But what shall I do? Where shall I seek for employment?"
               Half an hour after she had asked herself these questions so earnestly, Agnes
                  picked up a newspaper, and the first thing that met her eyes was an advertisement
                  for a person to give lessons in music and one or two modern languages to three
                  young ladies, for which a liberal compensation would be paid. Without saying a
                  word to her aunt, Agnes put on her things and went to the place mentioned in the
                  advertisement. The house before which she paused was a very large one, in a
                  fashionable part of the city; every thing around it indicated a wealthy owner. For
                  a few moments, she felt timid, and hesitated about presenting herself; but she
                  soon regained her self-possession, and made the application for which she had
                  come.
               A middle-aged woman, of mild and ladylike deportment, met he on being shown into
                  one of the apartments of the house.
               "I believe you advertised for a teacher," said Agnes, speaking in a low, trembling
                  voice. She found herself more agitated than she had expected.
               "We did," replied the lady, "and have already received several applications,
                  though none of those who have answered the advertisement suit us in all respects.
                  And I am afraid that we shall hardly find all that we desire in you."
               There was nothing in the way this was said to hurt the feelings of Agnes, but
                  rather to make her feel more free to speak.
               
               "Why do you think I will not suit?" she asked, looking earnestly into the lady's
                  face.
               "Because you are too young. You cannot be over seventeen years of age."
               "I am nineteen," returned Agnes.
               "But even that is too young. We wish a person of some experience, and of the first
                  ability. I will not question your ability, but you certainly cannot have much
                  experience in teaching. Have you ever given lessons in music?"
               "Not yet; but I wish to do so, and believe that I could give satisfaction."
               "Then you have never been engaged in teaching at all?"
               "No, never."
               "I hardly think you would suit us."
               The countenance of Agnes fell so suddenly that the lady's sympathies were
                  awakened, and she said, "Are you very desirous of securing a situation as
                  teacher?"
               "Desirous above all things," replied Agnes, with much earnestness.
               The lady continued to ask question after question, until she understood fully what
                  was in the young girl's mind. She then appreciated her more highly, although she
                  did not believe her fully qualified to give the instruction that was desired.
                  Agnes, who gained confidence the more she conversed with the lady, at length urged
                  that she might have a trial.
               "But suppose, after we give you a trial, that you do not suit us; we shall find it
                  hard to send you away."
               The force of this objection was fully appreciated by the lady when she uttered it,
                  for already she felt so drawn toward the young girl with whom she was holding the
                  interview, that her feelings were fast getting the control of her judgment.
               "I am sure I will suit you," replied Agnes, "for I will give the most untiring
                  attention to my duties."
               The lady looked at her beautiful young face, lit up with the earnestness of a true
                  purpose, and felt as she had never before felt for a stranger. She addressed her a
                  few words in French, to which Agnes replied in the same language.
               "Your accent is certainly very correct. Now let me hear you perform something on
                  the piano," she said.
               Agnes went to the instrument, and, after selecting a piece of music, sat down and
                  ran her fingers gracefully over the keys. The lady stood by to listen. Soon the
                  young girl was in the midst of a beautiful but familiar composition, which she
                  executed with unusual taste and brilliancy. Her touch was exquisite, and at the
                  same time full, and, where required, bold and confident.
               "Admirable!" she heard uttered in a low voice just behind her, as she struck the
                  last note in the piece. It was not the voice of a woman.
               
               She started and turned quickly. More auditors than she had supposed were present.
                  A young man and three beautiful young girls stood listening behind their mother;
                  they had been attracted from an adjoining room by the music, so far superior to
                  any thing ordinarily heard. A deep crimson overspread the sweet young face of
                  Agnes, heightening up every native charm. The young man instantly retired, and the
                  mother introduced her to her daughters, who were in love with so lovely an
                  instructress, and threw their voices at once in her favour. These voices but
                  seconded the mother's prepossessions.
               "Nothing has yet been said about compensation," remarked the lady to Agnes, after
                  she had requested the girls to leave them again alone. "We are willing to pay
                  liberally, if we can get the person we want. At present, I feel strongly in favour
                  of giving you a trial. If, after thinking over the subject, it is concluded to do
                  so, your salary will be four hundred dollars. Do you think that will meet your
                  wishes?"
               "Fully," replied Agnes, with an emotion that she could scarcely conceal. The sum
                  was larger than she had expected.
               "Of course, I would like to be at home every night with my aunt," said she.
               "To that we should make no serious objection. To-morrow morning I will be prepared
                  to give you an answer."
               Agnes retired with a heart full of hope, yet trembling lest something should
                  prevent the engagement she was so eager to make. She said nothing to her aunt,
                  who, bent on taking boarders, started out on the ensuing morning to look for a
                  house suited for that purpose. As soon as she was gone, Agnes went with a
                  trembling heart to hear the decision that was to be made in favour or against her
                  application. It was favourable.
               On going home, she found that her aunt had not yet returned, nor did she come back
                  for two hours; then she was so worn down with fatigue, that she had to go to bed.
                  A cup of tea revived her; but her head ached so badly, that she did not get up
                  until late in the afternoon, when she was better.
               "I have found a house, Aggy," said she, as soon as she felt like alluding to the
                  subject, "that will just suit. The owner is to give me an answer about it
                  to-morrow."
               "If looking for a house has made you sick enough to go to bed, aunt," returned
                  Agnes, "how can you expect to bear the fatigue of keeping boarders in the house
                  after you have taken it? You must not think of it. In two good rooms, at a light
                  rent, we can live very comfortably, and at an expense much lighter than we have at
                  present to bear."
               "Yes, Agnes, comfortably enough, if we had the ability to meet that expense; but
                  we have not. You know that there is no income."
               
               "There has been none, but"â€”
               "But what, dear?" Mrs. Wellford saw that there was something more than usual in
                  the mind of Agnes.
               "Forgive me, dear aunt," said the affectionate girl, throwing her arms around the
                  neck of her relative; "but I cannot see you, at your time of life and in
                  ill-health, compelled to toil as you propose. I have, therefore, applied for and
                  secured a situation in a private family, as a teacher of music and languages to
                  three young ladies, for which I am to receive a salary of four hundred dollars a
                  year."
               While Mrs. Wellford was looking for a house, and after she had found one, the
                  fatigue and pain she suffered led her more fully to realize than she had done
                  before, the great labour, with a doubtful result, that she was about taking upon
                  herself. She was, therefore, just in the state of mind to receive the unexpected
                  communication made by Agnes.
               "You are a good girl," she merely replied, kissing her as she spoke.
               "And you do not object?" eagerly asked the niece.
               "How can I?" responded Mrs. Wellford, leaning her head down upon the shoulder of
                  Agnes. In a few moments she said, as she looked up, with tears glittering on her
                  eyelashesâ€”"May Heaven reward you!" And turning away, she left Agnes to her own
                  happy thoughts.
               Six months from this time, as Mrs. Lionel sat alone in her room, gloomy and sad,
                  the woman with whom she was living, and upon whom she still laid herself a heavy
                  burden, came in where she was, and saidâ€”"Did you know that your niece, Agnes
                  Wellford, was married yesterday to a son of one of the richest men in town?"
               "No; it can't be!" quickly replied Mrs. Lionel. "Mr. Wellford died not worth a
                  dollar, and his widow has ben as poor as poverty ever since."
               "No, not quite that," said the woman. "Agnes has supported her comfortably by
                  teaching music. I heard the whole story this morning. Mrs. Wellford wanted to keep
                  boarders, but Agnes wouldn't hear to it, and, against her aunt's wishes, went out
                  and applied for a place as teacher to three young ladies in a wealthy family, for
                  which she was to receive a salary of four hundred dollars a year. She had not
                  taught long before the brother of the young ladies fell in love with her, to which
                  no very strong objection was made by his friends; and now they are married."
               "And what of Mrs. Wellford?" was eagerly inquired.
               "They go to housekeeping forthwith, and Mrs. Wellford is to live with them."
               Mrs. Lionel clasped her hands together, and sinking back in her chair,
                  murmuredâ€”"Oh, what an error I committed!"
               
               "How?" inquired the woman. But Mrs. Lionel did not answer the question.
               She had her reward, and Mrs. Wellford had hers.
            
            
               THE LOTTERY TICKET.
               TWO young storekeepers, whose capital in trade was rather small, and who daily saw
                  excellent opportunities for making money pass unimproved for want of the means to
                  embrace them, sat conversing about their future prospects. Their names were Felix
                  Granger and Ellis Day.
               "If I could only raise five or six thousand dollars somewhere," remarked the
                  former, "I could double the sum in two years."
               "So could I, easily," returned Day. "But that amount of money is not to be picked
                  up readily. One thing, I am making a good living and slowly improving my
                  condition, and I suppose I ought to be content. In the end, if all goes on as it
                  has begun, I shall accumulate, I hope, enough to live upon."
               "It's too slow work for me. I feel like a man trying to run with clogs upon his
                  feet. The fact is, I must have more capital from somewhere. I'll tell you what
                  I've more than half made up my mind to do."
               "What?"
               "Buy a ticket in the lottery, and try my luck. Prizes may be drawn every day, and
                  why may not I meet with good fortune?"
               Day shook his head.
               "What's your objection?" asked Granger.
               "I don't believe that any good ever came of meddling with lotteries."
               "Why?"
               "In the first place, the chances are all against drawing a prize. Not more than
                  one in a hundred is successful; and yet the ninety-nine who draw blanks are just
                  as full of hope for the prize as he who draws it, and are just as much diverted
                  from right business thoughts during the time that elapses between the purchase of
                  the ticket and the drawing of the lottery. The loss of the drawer of the blank is
                  not alone the loss of his money. He loses in his business, often seriously, from
                  the diversion of thought that must accompany the suspense he is doomed for a time
                  to feel. Instead of applying himself diligently to the doing of what his hands
                  find to do in his daily employments, he is thinking about the use he will make of
                  his money, if he should be so fortunate as to draw a prize. And in the second
                  place, if he should succeed in getting a lucky number, he will be almost certain
                  to lose all that he has gained, and
                  more besides, in trying for another and a higher prize."
               "Trust me for that," returned Granger. "Let me once get my fingers upon five, ten,
                  or twenty thousand dollars, and you won't find me meddling with lottery
                  tickets."
               "I wouldn't trust any man," said Day.
               "Not even yourself?"
               "No, not even myself."
               "Wouldn't you buy a ticket if you knew you would draw a prize?"
               "As that is supposing what cannot be, I will answer neither in the affirmative nor
                  negative. But my own impression is, that money obtained by means of lotteries
                  never does any good."
               "Why not?"
               "For this reason: Money is a standard of value, and passes in society as a
                  representative of some kind of property; which is a thing in itself useful to
                  mankindâ€”as houses, lands, produce, manufactures, etc. When we receive money in
                  business, it represents a benefit we have conferred upon another. But when money
                  comes through a lottery, it does not correspond to any benefit conferred, but is
                  actually the correspondent of injury done to others; for hundreds have lost, that
                  one might gain. If a man in business accumulate ten thousand dollars, that sum has
                  been received from perhaps more than a thousand different sources, in return for
                  wants supplied plied; but, if a man draw ten thousand dollars in a lottery, he has
                  received from a large number of persons their one, or two, or ten dollars, without
                  making them any return. Nothing has been produced; no want supplied. Society has
                  been in no way benefited, but actually injured. The whole proceeding, from
                  beginning to end, has been disorderly and detrimental. And I cannot but believe
                  that the money so obtained will prove more a curse than a blessing; and this,
                  because I hold that all evils in society react with pain against those who
                  practise them."
               "Give me ten thousand dollars and I will run all such risks," said Granger.
                  "Somebody will get the prize, and I might as well have it as any one. Come! Join
                  me in a ticket. I have been looking over a first-rate scheme, which is to be drawn
                  day after tomorrow."
               But Day shook his head, and said "No," firmly.
               "Well, if you won't, I will try my luck alone. The tickets are only five
                  dollars."
               That day, Granger bought a ticket. A dozen times before the drawing of the lottery
                  did he call in to see his friend Day, and as often did he mention what was
                  uppermost in his mindâ€”the prize he hoped to draw.
               "If I get ten thousand, I will lend you two or three thousand to give you a
                  start," said he, on the day before the drawing was to take place. This was spoken
                  in apparent jest, but he really felt in earnest.
               
               Day could not help smiling.
               "You may laugh," returned the other, "but when you see me with ten or fifteen
                  thousand dollars in hand, you will not think me quite the fool you now do."
               "If you should be so lucky, I prophesy that your ten or twenty thousand dollars
                  will do you no good in the end; that in ten or twenty years you will be no better,
                  but worse off, in consequence of your prize."
               "I'll risk it."
               "No doubt you are perfectly willing to do so."
               "And so would you be."
               "I shall keep out of temptation, at least, by not buying a ticket," replied Day.
                  "If I could get more capital in my business, in a perfectly legitimate way, I
                  would be glad to do so, for then I could make larger and more profitable
                  operations. But as I see no approved mode of obtaining this capital, I must be
                  content to plod on as I am now going. It will all come out right in the end, I
                  doubt not."
               "Ill furnish you with more capital in a few days," said Granger, laughingly.
               "Very well. I'll give you good security and pay you a fair interest," was the
                  laughing reply.
               "But won't you be afraid of money drawn in a lottery?"
               "No, not to borrow it. But I would be afraid to draw it."
               "Dividing a hair between north and north-west sidesâ€”a distinction without a
                  difference."
               "To me it is not. I can see a very great difference."
               On the next day, late in the afternoon, Felix Granger came hurriedly into the
                  store of Ellis Day. His manner was flurried; he had a look of wild elation.
               "Didn't I tell you so!" he exclaimed, in a thick voice. "Didn't I say that I would
                  draw a prize!"
               "You did," returned Day, calmly.
               "And I said true. I've got the twenty-five thousand dollar prize as certain as
                  death."
               "Indeed!"
               "True as preaching."
               "Twenty-five thousand dollars!"
               "Ay! Twenty-five thousand dollars! Think of that, friend Day!"
               And he caught the hand of his friend, and almost crushed it in a vice-like
                  grip.
               "A'n't I a lucky dog? I always said I was born under a fortunate star; though, I
                  confess, that I had to wait long before the right aspect came. But all in good
                  time! I've no complaint to make. Twenty-five thousand dollars! Just think of that!
                  Won't I do business now with a rush? Won't I show some of the sleepy ones in the
                  trade a specimen of tall walking? Won't I?"
               And for very want of breath, the excited young man paused.
               
               "What do you think of lotteries now?" he asked, after he had recovered himself a
                  little. "A'n't you tempted to try your luck?"
               "I think of them as I always did. I believe I shall not try my luck. I might be so
                  unfortunate as to draw a prize."
               "Are you crazy, Ellis Day?"
               "Perhaps I am. But, seriously, I would rather go on as I am going than draw a
                  prize of twenty thousand dollars. For slow and sure will bring all out right in
                  the end; but with twenty thousand dollars thrown suddenly into my lap, I might,
                  and no doubt would, be tempted to dash ahead at a rate so rapid as to be thrown
                  headlong from my course, and be worse off than I was when I began the world with
                  hope, energy, industry, and five hundred dollars in my pocket."
               "And this you predict for me?"
               "No. I predict nothing for you. I hope you will be wise and prudent in the use of
                  the large sum of money that has come into your hands."
               "Never fear for me. I know what I am about. Twenty-five thousand dollars is not a
                  sum large enough to turn my brain."
               It is worthy of remark, that Granger said nothing more about lending his friend a
                  few thousand dollars, as he had proposed in anticipation of a smaller prize than
                  the one he had drawn. Not that he had forgotten his promise, voluntarily made, but
                  ways in which he could use the whole amount of his now greatly increased capital
                  immediately presented themselves, and, instead of feeling that he had any thing to
                  spare, he felt that his operations would still be restricted within limits that it
                  would be desirable to pass.
               When the twenty-five thousand dollars were paid to Granger, which was not until
                  some weeks after the drawing of the lottery, he immediately laid out one hundred
                  dollars in tickets in another flattering scheme, intending, if he drew any thing,
                  to keep his promise to Day, which he now regretted having been weak enough to
                  make. He drew about fifty dollarsâ€”re-invested that in the same wayâ€”drew blanks,
                  and gave up lotteries. In this he was wiser than some men. Of course, Day did not
                  get the promised assistance in his business.
               Twenty-five thousand dollars in cash at once enlarged the credit of Granger from
                  seventy-five thousand to a hundred thousand dollars. All his business operations
                  became greatly extended, and he grew into a man of importance, both in his own
                  eyes and the eyes of others, quite rapidly.
               Whenever we begin to think highly of ourselves from any cause, but especially when
                  this increased self-estimation springs from the mere increased amount of worldly
                  goods that may happen to be possessed, we are almost sure to fall into error. The
                  first error committed by Granger was a most grievous ous one. When he drew the great prize, he was under
                  engagement of marriage with the daughter of a widow-lady named Riker, whose income
                  was small, and who was unknown in fashionable society. The mother and daughter
                  lived humbly, and all their time was usefully employed. Emma Riker had received a
                  good education, and was in every way the equal, in mental culture, of the young
                  man who had sought her hand.
               Granger mentioned to Emma the fact that he had purchased a ticket, and talked of
                  what he was going to do in case he drew a prize. When the prize came, he hurried
                  off to see her and tell of his good fortune, the news of which she received with
                  calmness, yet evident pleasure.
               For a month, the young man continued his visits as of old, and felt and acted
                  toward Emma as his affianced bride. After that, the idea of obtaining a rich wife
                  entered his mind. It was just as easy now, it occurred to him, to get a wife with
                  twenty or thirty thousand dollars, as one without a cent. But, then, he was under
                  an engagement of marriage; this thought produced an unpleasant sensation.
               The idea of a rich wife was a seed in the young man's mind, and toward it pride,
                  selfishness, and a love of money flowed as principles of life, first vitalizing
                  the seed, and then causing it to grow, sending down its roots in his heart, and
                  putting forth leaves and blossoms that ultimately produced noxious fruit.
               The possession of twenty-five thousand dollars, the enlargement of his business,
                  and the reputation of being a young man of great enterprise, enabled Granger to
                  form new acquaintances, and procured him invitations to fashionable parties in a
                  circle where he had never before moved. He mingled with young ladies of higher
                  pretensions, and attractions of a more imposing kind than such as were possessed
                  by Emma Riker. Contrasts unfavourable to the latter were constantly taking place
                  in his mind; the final result was a breach of the engagement. This was the first
                  and the worst error committed by the young man.
               The effect produced upon the mind of Emma was serious; but she concealed, as much
                  as possible, from the observation of every one, what she felt, and, in the
                  reflection that her lover had proved himself unworthy of the earnest and unselfish
                  affection she had borne him, sought to still the painful throbbing of her heart,
                  and banish from her mind the image that had so long filled it with light and
                  happiness. But she had a hard task to perform, and suffered much before it was
                  fully accomplished.
               A year from this time, Granger led to the altar the daughter of a rich merchant,
                  named Collins, who had enough pride, extravagance, and love of show to ruin any
                  man willing to be influenced by her.
                  Her father gave her a brilliant wedding-party, and a house furnished in the most
                  costly manner. The young couple started in life with some Ã©clat.
               No very long time elapsed after the marriage, before Granger discovered that his
                  wife had few, if any, domestic qualities; was self-willed, passionate, full of
                  pride, and alarmingly extravagant. Such a thing as consulting his tastes,
                  pleasures, or preferences, never appeared to cross her mind. In spite of the
                  effort he made not to do so, he could not help contrasting these qualities of his
                  wife with the very opposite ones that were possessed in such gentle and
                  unobtrusive, yet sweet perfection, by Emma Riker.
               Not more wisely did the young man act in business. He at once extended all his
                  operations and entered into new ones, employing every dollar of his capital, and
                  using his credit to very nearly its utmost limit. Under this system, he found
                  himself, by the end of a year or two, with a weight upon his shoulders that was
                  difficult to be borne. Notwithstanding this, he boasted of having made ten
                  thousand dollars during the first year, and twenty thousand in the second year
                  that followed his improved fortunes; and in opening the business of his third
                  year, he sought to extend still further all his operations. Through the influence
                  of his father-in-law, Granger got into the direction of a bank that was managed by
                  a clique of money-jobbers, through which he found no difficulty in passing his
                  father-in-law's notes to almost any amount; and Mr. Collins used the paper of his
                  son-in-law quite as freely. Thus their interests and fortunes became inextricably
                  blended.
               With such facilities, and the credit of having made a great deal of money and
                  being one of the most enterprising merchants in the city, Granger was able to do a
                  very heavy business; but, from the start, he had over-traded, and was always
                  driven by, instead of driving and rightly guiding and managing, his business.
               In the mean time, Ellis Day was going on as of old, quietly, carefully, and
                  safely. His operations were never very large, but they always yielded a fair
                  profit, and gradually extended every year. He had never been able to get an
                  advance of capital from any one: but this, he felt inclined to think, was all for
                  the best. More capital might have tempted him into water that was beyond his
                  depth.
               Some time after Granger's marriage, Day, who had met Emma Riker a year or two
                  previous, was again thrown into her company, and came into nearer association with
                  her than before. The oftener he met her, the more he liked her; and it was not
                  long before an intimacy sprang up between them, that ended in marriage; they went
                  to housekeeping in a neat, respectable, but not very costly style. Emma made a
                  prudent, loving wife, and grew daily more dear to her husband: their home was to each the pleasantest place on earth.
               Different, indeed, was the home of Felix Granger. All day he was in the rush,
                  hurry, excitement, and anxiety of business; and he came home at night fatigued,
                  and with a weight upon his breast: but there was no sweet smile there to fall upon
                  him like a sunbeam, no loving words to make him forget the cares of the day. It
                  not unfrequently happened that his wife was out, and remained out the whole
                  evening; or she was in an ill-humour about something, and hardly answered him
                  civilly, if he spoke to her; or she buried herself from tea-time until the hour
                  for going to bed in the pages of a new novel. To her husband she was, at no time,
                  a pleasant companion.
               The fact was, Mrs. Granger had no true affection for her husband, and did not put
                  herself out to assume a virtue she did not possess. Nor were indifference,
                  coldness, and sullenness the only ills which the husband had to bear; he was often
                  made to feel the worse irritation of direct ill-temper, that fretted him at times
                  beyond endurance, and led to open bickerings, usually brief, but violent while
                  they lasted. Thus the days of their wedded life passed on, and they were often
                  bitter days to both of them.
               Five years from the period at which the marriage of Ellis Day took place, he
                  removed with his little family into a beautiful but not very costly dwelling,
                  which he had just purchased. His business had increased steadily and safely, for
                  he had applied his mind diligently, from the first, to the attainment of a
                  thorough knowledge of every thing that related in any way to the particular branch
                  of trade in which he was engaged. It was rarely that he made a mistake in
                  purchasing, or bad debts in selling. As his experience became more matured and his
                  means enlarged, he was able to increase his business operations safely, and to
                  reap all the advantages of such an increase. The capital which he had been so
                  desirous of obtaining years before, would have been an injury to him rather than a
                  benefit. This he now clearly saw; for it would have led him into an enlargement of
                  his business, while his experience was yet but small, and might have involved him
                  in difficulties from which extrication would have been almost impossible.
               On the very day when he took possession of his new house, for which he had a clear
                  deed, every dollar of the purchase-money having been paid without disturbing his
                  business by a withdrawal of capital, both Mr. Collins and his son-in-law stopped
                  payment, the former with obligations out for three hundred thousand dollars, and
                  the latter for one hundred and fifty thousand. They had extended their business
                  operations and stretched their credit, until the foundation upon which they stood
                     became too weak to support them. The
                  father-in-law was older, shrewder, and less scrupulous than Granger: he took care
                  to save something from the wreck; but the latter came out penniless, and with a
                  heavy debt hanging over him. The beautiful house and rich furniture that had been
                  a part of his wife's marriage-portion were seized and sold to the highest bidder,
                  and he turned upon the world with a family of three children, having scarcely a
                  dollar in his pocket.
               Instead of sympathy from his wife, in the sad disaster that had befallen him, he
                  met with reproaches for not having made over to her and her children the house and
                  furniture she had brought him, and thus reserved a home for his family. To these
                  cruel reproaches, the disappointed, broken-spirited man had nothing to reply; he
                  felt crushed to the earth, and without the strength to lift himself up again. He
                  had fallen from so high a position, that he was nearly disabled by the
                  concussion.
               Thrown out of business, turned out of his home, and with nothing to live upon, he
                  was forced, reluctantly, to accept the constrained offer of his father-in-law to
                  go to his house with his family until he could get something to do. Naturally
                  independent in his feelings, this was a painful trial, especially as there was no
                  real cordiality in the invitation, and the addition of his family to that of Mr.
                  Collins was evidently felt as a burden.
               Some weeks after this arrangement had been entered tered upon, and at a time when
                  it was chafing him sorely, Granger called in to see his old friend Day, to solicit
                  from him a vacant clerkship in his store. After their meeting, Day expressed the
                  sincere regret he felt at the disastrous result of his business. With much
                  bitterness, the other repliedâ€”
               "Yes, disastrous enough; but I do not wonder at it, now that I am a sane man
                  again. Ellis Day, since the hour I drew that cursed prize in the lottery, I have
                  been beside myself. I have not acted, in a single instance, with the wisdom and
                  prudence of a man whose mind was well-balanced. I believe you now; but I did not
                  believe you when you told me that money obtained in the way I obtained twenty-five
                  thousand dollars, never does any good. You saw how it would beâ€”you, like a wise
                  man, could foresee the evil; but I, like a fool, passed on, and have been
                  punished, and grievous and hard to be borne is that punishment. It is felt by me
                  in the most intimate as well as in the most remote relations of life. Ah, my
                  friend, your patience, prudence, and willingness to wait for the gently-flowing
                  tide that bears us on to fortune, have met the just reward. Like you, had I been
                  thus prudent and thus willing to wait, I might now have been safely advancing
                  towards wealth, instead of being penniless, and with spirits broken, energy gone,
                  and the very light of life extinguished."
               Granger was deeply moved.
               
               The situation he asked was promptly given to him; but the salary was only eight
                  hundred dollars a year. This small sum was in no way adequate to the wants of Mrs.
                  Granger; she could spend it herself twice over, in the year; and because she could
                  not get as much as she wanted from her husband, she complained and fretted almost
                  constantly.
               Granger remained with Day only a few months, when his domestic irritations became
                  so great that, in a fit of passion and despair, he left the city; and, though some
                  years have passed, he has never since been heard of by his family.
               So much for a prize in the lottery! We agree, perfectly, with Ellis Day, that no
                  good ever comes from money obtained by this or any other species of gambling, and
                  for the reason already alleged, that it does not correspond to any use in the
                  community, but has actually been obtained from those who have received no
                  equivalents therefor. Other reasons could also be given, but they must readily
                  suggest themselves to the mind of almost every reader.
            
            
               THE MOTHER AND SON.
               IN a richly-furnished chamber, a young woman, with a pale, serious face, reclined
                  upon a bed; even without the fulness and flush of health, beauty was stamped upon
                  every feature. Her forehead was broad and white, her eyes dark and brilliant, her
                  lips most delicately formed; yet over the whole a proud spirit had written
                  characters that all could read, even though it was plain to be seen that she had
                  suffered, from some cause, deep humiliation.
               It was night, and she was alone; but her eyes were frequently turned toward the
                  door with a look of interest, and she seemed all the time listening, as if for the
                  approach of some one who was expected. At last a woman, past the middle age,
                  entered; as she did so, the invalid rose up with a look of inquiry.
               "Has it been done?" she asked in a low voice.
               "Every thing is ready. Will you not see him?"
               "No, no," replied the young woman, raising both her hands, as if to hide some
                  disagreeable object from her sight, and turning her head aside.
               "He is sleeping so sweetly, and looks as innocent as an angel," said the woman; "you may never see
                  his face again."
               "Pray Heaven I never may! Noâ€”noâ€”noâ€”I cannotâ€”I will not see him. Let all be done as
                  I have directed," and the speaker sank back upon the bed, and buried her face in
                  the pillow.
               The woman withdrew, and she was again left alone. For an hour, the invalid lay
                  almost as motionless as if life were extinct. The woman with whom she had held the
                  brief conference we have just recorded, came back again after the lapse of ten
                  minutes, but her entrance was not apparently noticed. Years of misery were crowded
                  into that one hour thus spent in self-communion; and years elapsed before its
                  deeply-cut record was effaced. Effaced? It was only covered over for a time by
                  other mementos, but never effaced.
               It was a dark, cold night in December; since the day closed in, snow had begun to
                  fall, and was now filling the air, and whirling about in the mourning gusts that
                  swept along the streets and eddied among the houses, scattering its white favours
                  broadly over the earth, creeping quietly into nooks and corners, now lightly
                  falling upon the window-panes, and now rushing fiercely against them with a heavy
                  rustling sound that fell off quickly into a low, retreating sigh. It was a night
                  to make those who gathered around the warm fireside feel thankful for the good
                  gifts they enjoyed.
               In a narrow court, far away from any of the neighbourhoods where wealth built up
                  her splendid mansions, stood a low frame dwelling, in which lived a poor widow,
                  named Oliver. She had three young children, and her only means of subsistence were
                  in her ability to work with her hands.
               The widow Oliver had finished her day's work, or rather all the work she happened
                  to have in the house; and after putting her little ones to bed, sat down by the
                  light of a single tallow-candle to sew for herself. This, in her estimation, was
                  more like recreation than work. Her work was what she daily performed as a means
                  of obtaining money with which to buy food and clothing for herself and her little
                  ones. All the time she could gain from this necessary toil to make and mend her
                  own and her children's clothes, seemed to be like a holiday, and was enjoyed quite
                  as well and even better than some persons enjoy their hours of idleness.
               The widow Oliver, though poor and with small means, had a woman's heart. She loved
                  her children, and worked for them with as much earnestness and far more real
                  pleasure than a merchant works for the wealth he seeks to accumulate. While her
                  affection prompted her to do all in her power to supply their wants, it also
                  prompted her to teach them to be contented with what they had, and to love one
                  another.
               She had finished her day's work, as we have said, and had drawn her chair close to the small light
                  emitted by a poor candle, in order to sew for herself, as she called it. This
                  sewing for herself was making some coarse aprons for her children, to cover and
                  protect their clothes. She had not noticed until now that it was storming. The day
                  had been cloudy, but snow had not begun to descend until after night-fall. A
                  rustling against the windows first gave her notice of the change without. A slight
                  shiver passed through her frame, more from the idea of coldness than from any real
                  change in her bodily sensation, and she moved her little work-table closer to the
                  fire of wood that was burning cheerfully upon the hearth.
               Thus alone, the widow sat and plied her busy needle, no sound falling upon her
                  ears except the murmur of the blazing fire, the clicking of her thimble, and the
                  occasional rushing of the storm against the windows, or its deep hollow moaning as
                  it swept around her humble dwelling. She had been sewing for nearly an hour, when
                  she stopped suddenly and listened; she laid down her work, and, taking the candle
                  in her hand, went up-stairs into the room over the one where she had been sitting,
                  and where her children lay asleep. Two were in a bed upon the floor, and the
                  third, who was little more than a babe, lay in the middle of her own bed. She held
                  the light close to the face of this one, and saw that he was not only sound
                  asleep, but had not moved since she laid him there. She then looked at the other
                  children for a moment or two; after this, she went down-stairs and resumed her
                  work. She had not taken many stitches before she paused again, and this time with
                  something like a start; the low cry of a child had fallen upon her ear with a
                  distinctness not to be mistaken. Again she ascended to the chamber, but all
                  remained as she had left it but a minute before; the children were fast asleep,
                  and evinced no sign of restlessness. Mrs. Oliver stood and listened in the chamber
                  for some time, but all remained quiet. She then went below and sat down beside her
                  work-table to resume her sewing; but ere she had taken her work in hand, the cry
                  of a child was again heard; but from whence the sound came she could not tell. It
                  seemed near to her, and yet not in the room, nor in the chamber above; nor was the
                  voice like that of one of her own children. Breathlessly she listened, with lips
                  apart and every sense alive; in a few moments the cry was repeated, louder and
                  more prolonged. She arose to her feet, listened again, and then sprang to the
                  door, unfastened and opened it. As she did so, the cold air, thick with large
                  flakes of snow, rushed in upon her, and for a moment took away her breath and
                  blinded her eyes. As soon as she was able to see, she perceived that a basket had
                  been placed by some one upon her door-step; at the same instant, the cry that had
                  before fallen upon her ear rose from the basket, and explained the mystery. The truth flashed over
                  her mindâ€”some heartless mother had abandoned her new-born babe!
               "Bless me!" exclaimed the widow, seizing the basket eagerly and lifting it within
                  the room, at the same time that she closed the door and locked it. Enveloped in
                  many folds of a fine soft blanket, and entirely protected from the cold and snow,
                  she found a male infant, apparently not more than a week old. Several changes of
                  clothes were in the basket, and a paper containing a small sum of money; but there
                  was no message from the cruel mother to her to whom she had consigned her babe;
                  not even the simple request that the helpless one should at least receive kindness
                  for its own sake. Fully and entirely had it been abandoned, seemingly without a
                  thought for its welfare.
               In the morning, it soon became known that an infant had been left, on the previous
                  night, at the door of the widow Oliver, and the neighbours came in, one after
                  another, to see the babe and to talk over the strange incident.
               "What are you going to do with it?" was the universal question; and
               "Keep it," was the unvarying reply.
               "Indeed, then, and I would do no such thing," said one; "you have enough to do to
                  take care of what you have."
               "I wouldn't take the bread out of my children's mouths to put it into the mouth of
                  a stranger's," said another.
               "Send it to the almshouse," advised a third.
               But Mrs. Oliver had but one reply for all these suggestions. It was the reply of a
                  true woman.
               "God has sent this infant to my door. Shall I refuse to take it and nurse it for
                     Him? No, henceforth it shall be as one of my own childrenâ€”I will
                  know no difference."
               As she said, so she acted. From that hour, the little Henry, as she called him,
                  was to be as her own child, and it was not long before her love for him was as
                  tender and deep as for her own children. With the care of an infant on her hands,
                  Mrs. Oliver could not earn as much by sewing as formerly, but the deficiency
                  arising from this cause was made up to her in another way. With the money she
                  received with the babe, she bought a cow, which gave her enough milk for the
                  children, besides several quarts to sell every day. She had lived in the country
                  and understood all about the management of cows, and had long desired to have one.
                  Milking and attending to the cow afforded her healthy exercise after sitting for
                  hours at her work, and was no loss of time; for the money she received for the
                  milk she sold was very nearly double what she could have earned with her needle in
                  the time it took her to milk, feed, and see after the animal she had bought. Thus
                  Heaven, that had sent her the babe,
                  provided the means in her hands for its sustenance without increasing perceptibly
                  her burdens.
               From the hour when she received her little Henry, no word or token had ever come
                  from those who had left him to perish, it might have been, in the cold at her
                  door. As to who his mother was, or to what family he stood related, she remained
                  in entire ignorance.
               Year after year passed away, and the babe grew from infancy to childhood and
                  youth. He proved to be a brighter boy than any of Mrs. Oliver's own children, and
                  had a prouder spirit; but he had generous qualities of mind, with independence, a
                  love of truth, and firmness and decision of character. His most serious defect was
                  a high temper; but all his good qualities were encouraged, and all that showed
                  itself as evil, gently, yet firmly restrained and kept as quiescent as
                  possible.
               As soon as Henry was old enough to learn, Mrs. Oliver taught him to read, as she
                  had done her own children, and then sent him to one of the common schools. Here he
                  made, in the course of a few years, rapid advancement. At the age of fourteen, a
                  gentleman of eminence in the profession of law, named Hallam, under whose notice
                  the lad had several times fallen, and who saw that he possessed more than ordinary
                  abilities, offered to pay for his instruction in the higher branches of education
                  in one of the literary institutions in the city, for three years, if Mrs. Oliver
                  thought she could bear the expense of his maintenance, as well as furnish him with
                  suitable clothing. Her oldest child, a boy, had been apprenticed two years
                  previously, and she had begun to talk about putting Henry out to learn a trade
                  also.
               "For the sake of such advantages," she replied, "I will do any thing in my
                  power."
               As proposed, Henry was entered at one of the best institutions, and completed a
                  course of studies, in three years, of greater extent than is usually accomplished
                  in four years by students of good capacity. So much was the individual who had
                  generously offered him these invaluable facilities gratified with the result, that
                  he took him into his office, and from that time bore all his expenses until he was
                  of age and ready to be admitted at the bar.
               During the four years that Henry remained in the office of his generous and
                  disinterested benefactor, he devoted himself not only to the study of the
                  profession for which he was destined, but to general literature and science;
                  furnishing his mind at every point, and laying the foundation upon which he was to
                  build, in the future, a safe structure of eminence and usefulness. As he
                  approached the age of manhood, Mr. Hallam, who had become strongly attached to his
                     protegÃ©, took him into society and introduced
                  him to the acquaintance of men of standing, intelligence, and superior
                  attainments. At first, his modest worth
                  was not seen; but soon, like stars from an evening sky, first one ray of light and
                  then another shone forth, until the brilliancy of his acquirements and the
                  profoundness of his intellect were acknowledged and appreciated.
               But no change in his external condition, or of the point from which he looked upon
                  the world, affected, in the smallest degree, the love and gratitude he bore to her
                  whom he called by the holy name of "mother." Mr. Hallam, who was wealthy, supplied
                  him with a certain amount of money to meet his expenses. It was necessary that he
                  should dress as those did into whose society his benefactor had introduced him;
                  but in doing this he exercised the closest economy, and made it a point to
                  preserve his clothes with the utmost care. Beyond this, he never spent a dollar;
                  all that remained was given to Mrs. Oliver, with whom he continued to reside: this
                  was never less than six or seven dollars every week, which, with what she still
                  continued to earn, enabled the widow to live much more comfortably than had
                  formerly been the case.
               At length, Henry Oliver became of age, and was admitted to the bar.
               "What are your views and intentions now, Henry?" asked Mr. Hallam, as they walked
                  together from the court-room
               "I expect to follow the profession for which I have been educated," replied the
                  young man.
               "In this city?"
               "Oh, yes. I have no wish to remove from here."
               "Practice comes slowly to a young man," remarked Mr. Hallam. They were just then
                  at the door of his office, and entered before Henry made any reply.
               As they sat down, Mr. Hallam repeatedâ€”"As I said, Henry, practice comes slowly to
                  a young man, more particularly in the law."
               "I am aware of that," was replied, with some seriousness of voice and expression
                  of countenance. "But I must wait my time. I suppose I shall get something to do;
                  at least enough to meet my expenses."
               "Yes, if you hunt up magistrates' cases, do your share of pettifogging, and take
                  good care to make the most out of a cause when you do get one."
               "None of which I can or will do," replied the young man, promptly.
               "Then I am not so sure that you will at once be able to meet your expenses, unless
                  they be very light," said Mr. Hallam.
               "I will see that they are not heavy," was the quiet reply, "while I await
                  patiently the sure reward of 'timeâ€”faithâ€”energy.' "
               "And that reward will come, Henry, sooner or later."
               "I know it. I will wait."
               Mr. Hallam cast his eyes to the floor thoughtfully fully, and sat for some minutes; then looking up,
                  he saidâ€”"Henry, would you be willing to take a share in my business? Or do you
                  prefer to start alone and build up a reputation for yourself?"
               "To be associated with you in business," the young man said, with evident emotion,
                  "would be the greatest benefit I could now receive, and would overstep all my
                  present ambition. But I never hoped for any thing like this."
               "If you are disposed to share the labour of my heavy practice," returned Mr.
                  Hallam, "I will at once take you into the business. I must have an associate, and
                  you will suit me best. Turn it over in your mind, and if you think such an
                  arrangement desirable and advantageous, it can be at once entered into. I will, in
                  the beginning, give you the proceeds of one-fifth of my practice, which will yield
                  you very near two thousand dollars per annum; this to continue for three years.
                  After that, the partnership can be dissolved or formed upon a new basis, as may be
                  agreeable to both."
               It was some time before Henry could compose his mind sufficiently to reply. The
                  generous offer, so unexpected, completely overpowered him.
               "I accept the offer with gladness," he said; "and more for the sake of another,
                  than for the high advantages that it presents to me. Deserted by her who gave me
                  birth, and left, as I have been told, in the street on a stormy night, she whom I
                  now call my mother took me in and loved me, and cared for me as for her own
                  children, sharing with me the food she earned for them, and working harder that
                  they might feel no privations. What do I not owe to her? I would repay the debt
                  with my life, if I could. My motherâ€”for such I acknowledge her in my heart to be,
                  as well as call her so with my lipsâ€”still has to work with her hands, old as she
                  is, although every dollar with which your generous bounty has supplied me, beyond
                  what was necessary to furnish me with suitable clothing, has gone into her hands.
                  Now, thanks to your noble offer, I can place her above labour and above want, and
                  in a position such as she deserves. For her sake, my dear sir, do I thank
                  you."
               Henry grasped the hand of Mr. Hallam, as he ceased speaking, while tears, that he
                  could not repress, gushed from his eyes.
               "Thrice worthy of all my best affections, which you have long had, do I feel you
                  now to be, my dear boy," said Mr. Hallam, returning with ardour the pressure of
                  Henry's hand; "your noble wishes shall at once be gratified."
               Turning to his desk, Mr. Hallam, in the generous enthusiasm of the moment, drew a
                  check for a thousand dollars, and handing it to the young man, said, as he did
                  soâ€”"Take that: it is the first fruits of your new business; place your mother in
                  just the position your heart desires her to be in."
               
               Henry wrung the hand of Mr. Hallam, and then passed quickly from the office; he
                  could not trust himself to utter the deep gratitude he felt.
               A neat, but not large house was immediately rented, and furnished with a degree of
                  taste, comfort and elegance far beyond what the limited means of Mrs. Oliver had
                  ever enabled her to enjoy. Into this house Henry took his mother after all was
                  ready, and gave her the first happy intelligence of the change that had taken
                  place, by sayingâ€”"This, dear mother, is all your own. No more care and labour, but
                  rest, and peace, and comfort for your declining years. It is some small return for
                  all I owe you; but small as it is, I bring it to you with a glad heart."
               Sacred to filial and maternal love were the tears that mingled freely when all was
                  explained and understood. It was some time, however, before Mrs. Oliver could
                  really believe that what she saw and heard was not in a dream.
               Associated with Mr. Hallam, Henry soon had an opportunity of distinguishing
                  himself in a case of great importance, by an argument before the court that at
                  once gave him a reputation for acuteness of mind, strong good sense and powerful
                  eloquence. Not many years elapsed before he was considered one of the ablest
                  lawyers at the bar; his income, from two thousand dollars a year, soon increased
                  to double that amount. He did not forget, in his prosperity perity, the children
                  of Mrs. Oliver, with whom he had grown up; but feeling toward them as a brother,
                  he acted as he felt, and aided them materially in their efforts to improve their
                  condition.
               Five years from the time when Henry Oliver commenced the practice of law, in
                  association with Mr. Hallam, he was run by one of the political parties for
                  Congress, and elected by a large majority. In the hall of representatives he
                  distinguished himself in many important debates, and his name became known
                  throughout the country. For many years he continued to be elected to Congress, and
                  to be held in high estimation as a man of great intellectual power and unflinching
                  integrity. No man had a fairer reputation, no man was held in greater esteem by
                  his personal friends, or by the people, who only knew his worth by the quality of
                  his acts.
               Thus had he earned for himself a distinguished name; all men were proud to take
                  him by the hand, and all circles felt honoured by his presence, even though the
                  facts of his early life and doubtful parentage were well known.
               Mr. Hallam, with whom Henry was still associated in business, was sitting in his
                  office one day, about ten years from the time when young Oliver had stepped upon
                  the world's broad stage as a man, when the widow of a very eminent professional
                  man who had died some years before came in and begged to have a few words of conversation with him,
                  provided the interview would be considered strictly confidential. Mr. Hallam had
                  known the lady for years. She was connected with some of the best families in the
                  State, and had, in her younger days, been a brilliant woman of fashion. He assured
                  her that any thing she might wish to say to him would be held perfectly sacred.
                  She seemed a good deal disturbed, and sat for some time evidently at a loss how to
                  begin the communication she wished to make. At length, she saidâ€”"You are, of
                  course, intimately acquainted with Mr. Oliver."
               "I am," replied Mr. Hallam; "I raised him, I might almost say, from a boy; I know
                  him thoroughly."
               "He has made himself a brilliant reputation," remarked the lady.
               "He has fairly and honestly made it. But the public know not half his worth."
               "Do you know his family?" asked the lady.
               "No, nor does he know them himself. He was abandoned by his mother when an
                  infant."
               "So I have heard. But has he no suspicion who are his relations?"
               "None in the least."
               "Let them occupy what social position they may, he will do them no discredit,"
                  said the lady.
               "Discredit!" ejaculated Mr. Hallam. "No, ma'am! But he would do them honour. I
                  care not who his relatives are, or how high they stand, Henry Oliver is worthy to
                  take his place beside them."
               "They might claim him now, without a blush of shame," continued the lady, looking
                  intently in the face of Mr. Hallam.
               "So far as Henry is concerned, they might," he returned, feeling considerably
                  annoyed by the lady's manner and words, and not really understanding the drift of
                  her strange questions.
               "Mr. Hallam," resumed the visitor, after a pause, her voice slightly trembling, "I
                  will now communicate a secret that has been locked in my bosom for thirty years.
                  Henry Oliver is my son!"
               "Your son!" exclaimed Mr. Hallam, starting to his feet. "Impossible?"
               "It is as I say, Mr. Hallam. For years my eyes have been upon him, and I have
                  marked with a mother's prideâ€”mingled, it is true, with other motions of a far less
                  pleasing characterâ€”his steady advancement to positions of honour. The time has at
                  last come, it seems to me, when I may claim him without disgrace. It is no
                  dishonour to be the mother of such a son, even if he were not born in
                  wedlock!"
               Mr. Hallam was confounded. He made no reply, for no words that he dared utter
                  could at all express his feelings. While he stood silently looking into the face
                  of his visitor, she saidâ€”
               
               "Now that you know my secret, which, for the present at least, must remain such, I
                  wish you to obtain for me an interview with my son."
               Mr. Hallam bowed.
               "Can I have it to-day?"
               "I presume so."
               "May I ask you to bring Henry to my house this afternoon?"
               "I will tell him that you desire to see him, at any hour you may name," replied
                  Mr. Hallam.
               "Say five o'clock."
               Mr. Hallam again bowed.
               His visitor lingered for a while, making many remarks on the subject, all going to
                  show that the pride she felt in her son's reputation was the only incentive she
                  had in claiming him; and that this feeling entirely obliterated all shame and all
                  compunction at having abandoned him while an infant.
               At five o'clock, Henry Oliver called at the house of the lady who had desired an
                  interview, in order, as he supposed, to consult him on some professional business.
                  He found her sitting in one of her parlours. She received him in a formal and
                  somewhat embarrassed manner. After both had sat silent for some short space of
                  time, the lady said, without any preliminary remark, and in a low, rather agitated
                  voice,
               "Henry, I am your mother!"
               The young man sprang to his feet as suddenly as if a pistol had been fired close
                  to his ear; gave the woman a look of profound astonishment, and then replied in a
                  firm toneâ€”
               "No, madam! you are not my mother."
               "But I tell you I am!" returned the woman, rising also to her feet. "You are my
                  son, and my only son!"
               "I deny the relationship!" exclaimed the young man indignantly. "I was abandoned
                  in infancy, I know, by some unfeeling monster; but God gave me a mother to love
                  me, and she is my mother stillâ€”my true and only mother."
               As if stricken down by a heavy blow, the woman sank upon the sofa from which she
                  had arisen, and Henry Oliver turned away and rushed from the house.
               Nothing of all this was breathed by the young man to any living soul. He locked it
                  up in his bosom, even from Mr. Hallam. But that gentleman saw enough of the effect
                  of the interview upon both him and the individual who had claimed to be his mother
                  when it was too late, to satisfy him of its true nature. He could not but honour
                  the young man for his noble indignation, at the same time that he grieved for the
                  pang such an announcement as had been made to him must have caused.
               Shortly after this, Henry Oliver was united in marriage to the daughter of a well
                  known senator of the United States, and thereby became connected with one of the oldest and most distinguished
                  families in the country. This union, however, did not take place before Henry had
                  fully communicated to both the lady and her parents all the facts regarding his
                  early and subsequent history, with the single exception of the discovery he had
                  made of his real parent. That was a secret locked in his bosom; and one of which
                  he never permitted himself to think, when he could force the subject from his
                  mind.
               Toward Mrs. Oliver, his "true and only mother," as he had expressed it, he
                  manifested to the last the warmest affection. For her husband's sake, his young
                  wife paid Mrs. Oliver the kindest attentions from the first. It was not long,
                  however, before she loved her for the affectionate gentleness, purity, and
                  excellence of her character; and when, in a good old age, she passed away from
                  them, she mingled her tears with those of her husband that watered the grave where
                  she was laid at rest.
               A few years after this event, as Mr. Hallam and Henry Oliver sat one day
                  conversing in their office, a woman, having the appearance of a domestic, came in
                  and asked for the latter. On being told which was the person she sought, she
                  saidâ€”
               "Mrs.â€”is very illâ€”and not expected to live. She wishes to see you before she
                  dies."
               "Tell her that I cannot"â€”Henry was speaking from a first impulse, forgetful where
                  he was, and of every thing but the instinctive repugnance he felt to an interview
                  with the person named. But a look and a gesture from Mr. Hallam caused him to
                  check his utterance of the words that were upon his lips.
               "A word with you, Henry," said the latter, rising, and both retired into an
                  adjoining room, after the messenger had been desired to wait for a few
                  minutes.
               As soon as they were alone, Mr. Hallam saidâ€”"Henry, I know your secretâ€”it is your
                  mother who"â€”
               "No sir, she is not my mother!" Oliver indignantly replied. "My mother is in
                  heaven!" As he said this, he began to pace the floor in an agitated manner.
               "She is the author of your being, Henry, as you are aware"â€”
               "So she says; but she abandoned me, and God gave me a true mother. Her and her
                  only have I known, and I will acknowledge no other. Does this woman deserve the
                  sacred name of mother? Noâ€”my heart will not acknowledge the relationship, and my
                  lips shall never give the lie to my heart. I cannot see her, Mr. Hallam! She is
                  nothing to me."
               "Humanity has some claims, Henry," returned Mr. Hallam, in a serious voice. "Since
                  the day when Mrs.â€”claimed you"â€”
               "Mr. Hallam, what do you know of all this?" said Oliver, much excited.
               
               "I knew all at the time," was calmly replied. "But as I was saying, since the day
                  when Mrs.â€”claimed you as her son, I have observed her closely. From that time she
                  has been changedâ€”greatly changed. The fire of her eyes has grown dim, her voice
                  has lost its fine expression, her step, so elastic even in old age, has become
                  slow and deliberate. Your refusal to acknowledge yourself her son seems to have
                  broken her spirits and destroyed the vital principle of her existence. Neither you
                  nor I can tell how much she has suffered, Henry; or how deeply she has repented.
                  God forgives, and you must do the same. In life's bitterest extremity, she sends
                  for youâ€”you, her son. Do not refuse to see her; but go, in the name of
                  humanity."
               "Let me think a moment," replied Oliver, with a bewildered look and a husky voice.
                  As he said this, he sank into a chair, and covered his face with his hands. For
                  more than a minute, he sat almost motionless, when a gush of tears evinced the
                  conquest of his better feelings.
               "Tell her," he said, looking up, "that I will be there."
               Mr. Hallam withdrew and informed the messenger that Mr. Oliver would attend to the
                  request she had brought.
               Half an hour afterward, Henry Oliver entered the chamber of Mrs.â€”. His face was
                  pale and the whole expression of his countenance subdued.
               The dying woman raised herself up as he drew near to her bedside, looking him
                  eagerly in the face. But she did not speak until she had motioned all her
                  attendants from the room. Then, with a voice low, tremulous, and tender even to
                  sadness, she murmuredâ€”
               "My sonâ€”my son!" and fell forward. Oliver received her in his arms, uttering, in
                  as low and sad a toneâ€”
               "My mother!"
               The whole frame of the dying woman quivered, she attempted to throw back her head,
                  evidently that she might look into his face, but, in the effort, every muscle of
                  her body became relaxedâ€”in the next moment, she lay dead in the arms of her
                  son.
            
            
               
               BETTER TO ACT THE GENTLEMAN.
               SOME men are born gentlemen, but the number is not large; others, in the process
                  of moral elevation, become gentlemen through a denial and removal of those selfish
                  influences that lead to an utter disregard of others; while a larger number merely
                  play the gentleman on such occasions as seem most fitting to advance their
                  interests or minister to their love of the world's good opinion, but are, at all
                  other times, as ungentlemanly in their intercourse as it is possible for them to
                  be. The very fact of playing the gentleman under restraint gives their boorish
                  propensities an increased activity the moment they are free again.
               Mr. Partridge belonged to and fairly represented the last-named class. He was no
                  gentleman, and yet, to have hinted at the truth would have been to awaken his
                  warmest indignation; for, strange as it may seem, he imagined himself to be every
                  inch a gentleman. Mr. Partridge was in business; though not as successful as he
                  might naturally wish to be. Money came in but slowly; while due-days days of notes
                  occurred with a most unpleasant frequency. A note-paying day rarely found Mr.
                  Partridge in his best humour, for it did not often occur that on such occasions
                  his bank account showed the required balance. Then he had to bustle around,
                  borrow, force collections, or sacrifice good paperâ€”none of which acts helped in
                  any way to produce an equable state of mind. The man who came into Mr. Partridge's
                  store on one of these note-paying days, had to be an excellent customer, or one
                  whose good opinion he had the best of reasons for wishing to retain, to meet with
                  any attentions whatever, or to escape downright insult.
               Mr. Partridge, in commencing business, had, like most young men, a fair proportion
                  of up-hill work to perform; for the largest part of his capital lay in his ability
                  and industry. The greatest drawback was in his own character. To a customer who
                  was expected to buy, Partridge was as affable and as polite as a man could be; and
                  the same was the case if the individual who called in at his store was one from
                  whom a present or remote advantage was expected. But, to all others, it came
                  natural to bristle like a porcupine; and the touch of his quills was felt and
                  remembered much oftener than he imagined, or than was at all for his interest to
                  occur. Many a dollar failed to reach his till on this account, that would,
                  otherwise, have reposed there; and many an hour was spent in money-hunting on
                     note-paying days, that might have
                  been spent at his desk or counter, had he been in heart what he affected to be on
                  certain occasionsâ€”a gentleman. But he did not know this; for inordinate self-love,
                  like the poison of a serpent, blinds at certain seasons. One dayâ€”it was a "short
                  day" with the young storekeeperâ€”a man came in, and, after looking around and
                  making casual examinations of goods, with the manner of a person who had some
                  other end than that of buying in his mind, approached the desk at which he was
                  standing, and made some remark, in a familiar way, about the weather. From the
                  moment the man came in, the eyes of Partridge were upon him; and he soon
                  understood, clearly, that he had no intention of buying. The way in which he
                  examined his goods annoyed him; and by the time the stranger reached the part of
                  the store where he stood, he was prepared to meet him with a rebuff.
               "What did you say, sir?" was the quick, rudely-uttered inquiry of Partridge.
               The man looked at him a moment with evident surprise, and then quietly turned
                  away, but still lingered in the store.
               "Mr. Partridge is not in, I presume," said he to a clerk, who stood behind one of
                  the counters, at some distance from where the proprietor still lingered moodily at
                  his desk.
               "Yes, sir, he's in," was the affable reply. "You were speaking with him a moment
                  ago."
               "Oh!" The man turned and looked at Partridge. In a little while afterward he went
                  away.
               "What did that fellow want?" asked Partridge ill-naturedly, as soon as the man had
                  withdrawn.
               "He wished to see you, I believe," replied the clerk.
               "I was here. Why didn't he tell me his business? I wonder what he wanted?"
               The incident rather worried the mind of the young storekeeper, for, with a
                  knowledge of the fact that the stranger asked for him, came the impression that,
                  in treating him rudely, he might have foregone some advantage.
               A few hours afterward, a man in the same business with himself said, on meeting
                  himâ€”"Have you seen Bispham?"
               "No!" The whole aspect of Partridge changed. "Is he in town?"
               "Yes."
               "Are you certain?"
               "I am. He was to see me, this morning."
               "Strange! He wrote me that he would be here about this time."
               "And hasn't he called on you yet?"
               "No."
               "I sold him a pretty good bill."
               "Ah?"
               "He'll be along, I suppose," said Partridge, with affected indifference, and then
                  hurried away to complete plete his
                  "financiering" for the day, and get back to his store as quickly as possible, to
                  await a call from Bispham; but, when evening came, the expected customer had not
                  arrived.
               On the next day, he heard of him in various quarters; and the invariable story was
                  that he had been buying, and cashing his bills. Partridge couldn't understand it.
                  During the past year, he had received many orders from Bispham, who lived in
                  Pittsburgh, all of which he had promptly filled, and, as far as he could judge
                  from letters, to the customer's satisfaction. Why he had passed his store, now
                  that he was in the city, and made bills at other establishments, was more than he
                  could divine.
               On the third day, Partridge saw the stranger before referred to enter his store
                  again, and linger around as before. After a while, he came up to the desk where
                  the young man stood, as on the previous occasion, and said to himâ€”"I believe I
                  have a small bill on your books, which might as well be settled. Bispham is the
                  name."
               "Mr. Bispham!" exclaimed Partridge, a sudden light breaking over his countenance.
                  "How do you do? I'm glad to see you. When did you arrive in our city?" And as this
                  was said, he reached out his hand and shook that of the customer warmly.
               "I've been here for several days," was the reply of Bispham; but there was no
                  correspondent enthusiasm in his manner.
               "Indeed! Why haven't you called before?"
               "I was in on the first day of my arrival," replied the merchant; "but was so
                  disgusted with the rudeness of one of your clerks, or some other person about your
                  establishment, that I didn't care to come again."
               The countenance of Partridge fell.
               "I'm sorry," he murmured in a low voice, while a guilty confusion was on his face.
                  "But I am sure, Mr. Bispham, that no rudeness was intended."
               "Perhaps not," said the customer; "but I'm rather sensitive on such matters. I
                  always make it a point to be civil to friends or strangers, and expect as much for
                  myself. If I don't find civility in any one, I don't feel bound to have any
                  intercourse with him either as a business man or a friend."
               A silence highly embarrassing to Partridge succeeded.
               "If you will draw off my account, I will settle it," said the merchant. "I must
                  leave for New York this afternoon."
               Partridge turned to his ledger and made out the bill.
               "It's a small matter, Mr. Bispham. There's no need of settling it just now," said
                  Partridge.
               "I like to pay off these small matters," replied Bispham, as he drew out his
                  pocket-book. "Put a receipt on it, if you please."
               
               The bill was receipted, and the money paid.
               "If you should want any thing more in my line, I hope you will send on your
                  orders," said Partridge. "I shall always be happy to furnish you with goods in my
                  line, at the lowest market-rates."
               "Thank you," replied Bispham; "but I've made arrangements with Murdock to do all
                  my business here in future."
               Then bowing with distant politeness, the merchant retired, leaving Partridge to
                  his own reflections, which were not of the most agreeable character.
               A lesson like this, it might be supposed, would do much for the improvement of our
                  hero's manners; but what is "bred in the bone is hard to come out of the flesh."
                  Unless a man, from impulse or long-confirmed habit, act the gentleman on all
                  occasions, he will be very apt to forget himself at times, when it would be much
                  to his interest and reputation to play his part in the most agreeable manner.
               When Bispham went back to Pittsburgh, he described to a man in the same business,
                  who was dealing pretty extensively with Partridge, the manner of his
                  reception.
               "I guess I'll give the gentleman a trial also," said the man. "I'm going to
                  Philadelphia next week."
               He did so. On arriving in the city, he called at the store of Partridge. Not being
                  a man of very remarkable presence, he did not receive any very particular
                  attention. This was all natural enough; but it did not stop there. In approaching
                  Partridge, which he did with some casual question, he was treated with such marked
                  indifference, and even rudeness, that he turned on his heel and left the store. As
                  in the previous case, Partridge remembered him when he called to settle his bill;
                  and, when it was too late to retrieve his error, found that he had, in his
                  boorishness, insulted one of his best customers.
               After that, for some weeks, he assumed a better exterior, and was particularly
                  pleasant to every one who came into his store; but, not turning up angels in
                  disguise, he became discouraged, and fell back into his old habit, that, like a
                  long-worn garment, fitted him more easily.
               A very natural thing, in the case of Partridge, was his falling in love. The
                  object of this attachment was a young lady of good family, every member of which
                  was as remarkable for true gentlemanly and ladylike conduct on all occasions, as
                  Partridge was remarkable for the opposite when there was nothing to be gained by
                  assuming a virtue to which he had no real title. The name of this young lady was
                  Emily Weston. Besides her social standing, accomplishments, beauty, and sweetness
                  of disposition, Emily possessed another attraction to which the young man was by
                  no means indifferentâ€”and that was
                  money. We will not say that this was her strongest attraction, so far as Partridge
                  was concerned; but it had its due influence in determining his favourable
                  impression of the young lady.
               In all his intercourse with Miss Weston and her family, Partridge was, of course,
                  the gentleman so far as exterior conduct was concerned; though it must, at the
                  same time, be admitted that he occasionally overacted his part. This arose from
                  the fact that his manners were assumed, instead of being spontaneous; and also in
                  consequence of a too recent consultation of Count D'Orsay's rules of etiquette.
                  Still the impression he made was favourable, and the young lady received his
                  addresses in no unwilling spirit. Every thing was going on most happily, and the
                  lover beginning to con over in his mind the form of application for the hand and
                  heart of the fair young lady.
               About this time, business called Partridge away as far as Boston. On his return,
                  he remained a couple of days in New York, for the transaction of some business,
                  and then left for home in the afternoon train. It was in the winter-time. As the
                  boat touched the Jersey side, Partridge was one of the first to spring ashore, and
                  press forward with eager haste, carpet-bag in hand, to secure a good seat. Passing
                  the conductor at the door of the car-house, he made his way to the ladies' car,
                  and though refused admittance by the man stationed there, he roughly pressed him
                  aside, and forced his way in, despite of opposition. He was the first to enter
                  this car, and had leisure to select just the place that suited him. Depositing his
                  carpet-bag on one end of a seat, he ensconced himself in the other, with a
                  resolution to occupy his comfortable quarters in the manner and form just assumed,
                  in despite of all ordinary efforts to remove him.
               Quickly following, came a hurrying crowd of men, women, and children, all eager to
                  secure good places; and in a very brief time, nearly every seat had one or more
                  occupants. As in most cases, a number of men who were not accompanied by ladies
                  had succeeded in forcing their way into this car, and each one of these, like
                  Partridge, occupied his single seat, and with the too evident intention of
                  occupying it "alone in his glory," if possible. These personages were all so very
                  intent on what was going on outside of the car, as to be oblivious of all
                  proceedings within. Such was the case with Partridge, when, a few moments before
                  the starting of the train, a gentleman touched him on the shoulder. Instantly he
                  turned his head, with a look of affected surprise, while a frown knit his brow.
                  The gentleman smiled, and said, politelyâ€”"I'm sorry to trouble you, but I have a
                  lady with me. Would you be kind enough to sit with the gentleman in front, and let
                  us have the place you occupy?"
               "I never change my seat," was the rude reply, and Partridge turned his head coldly, and resumed
                  his observation of what was passing without.
               The gentleman in front, hearing the request, and noting the manner of its
                  reception, arose quickly and tendered his place, falling back as he did so, and
                  forcing, with no dainty manner, his body down into the seat occupied by Partridge
                  and his carpet-bag. The frown on the young man's brow had deepened to a scowl as
                  he turned to resent, with a look, this invasion of his assumed rights, when, to
                  his utter dismay, the gentleman who had desired him to give place for a lady,
                  handed Emily Weston into the seat just left vacant. She did not turn to look at
                  him, and he knew not whether he had been recognised, or thought to be a stranger.
                  Her companion made some remark, in which the words "ungentlemanly" and "boorish"
                  reached his ear. If she replied, he did not hear what she said.
               By this time, the seats were all filled, and a number of ladies were standing in
                  the passage-way. Just then the conductor entered, and said in a loud voice, "Those
                  gentlemen who are unaccompanied by ladies will walk forward to the next car, where
                  there is plenty of room."
               Several men arose and went forward, but Partridge sat still, fearing to rise,
                  lest, in doing so, he should attract the attention of Emily. Three or four ladies
                  remained standing near. The conductor came along, and bending over towards him,
                  saidâ€”"Pass into the next car, if you please. This one is for ladies, and there are
                  a number not yet seated."
               At this address, Emily glanced around, and for the first time became aware that
                  the individual who had been guilty of the ungentlemanly rudeness just mentioned,
                  was her lover. Their eyes met for an instant, but in neither of them was there any
                  appearance of recognition. Partridge arose, and, with an abashed look, retired
                  into the next car.
               Several days were suffered to elapse after his return to Philadelphia, before he
                  ventured to call upon Miss Weston. During this time, a brother of the young lady,
                  who was usually in the store of Partridge almost every day, did not once make his
                  appearance. This was ominous of no good. When the visit was at length made, the
                  reception was, as the young man had feared, cold and formal; and this not only by
                  Emily herself, but by every member of the family. His real character had been
                  seen; he was recognised as not a true gentleman. It was in vain that repeated
                  efforts were made to conciliate the lady and her family; the quality of the young
                  man's mind had been detected, and they had turned from him with a repugnance that
                  nothing could remove. Such a man Emily could never love; such a man could not make
                  her happy; and she cast away the regard she had felt for him, without a painful
                  emotion.
               Under so smarting an experience, Partridge resolved solved that he would be more careful to ACT the
                  gentleman on all occasions, as the wisest and safest course; but the utter
                  disregard of others' feelings, comfort, or welfare, that is at the basis of his
                  character, is for ever leading him into little acts that betray the quality of his
                  mind, and make him known in all circles as a man who is, at least, NO
                  gentleman.
            
            
               PRINCIPLE AND INTEREST.
               A YOUNG man, who had received a tolerably good education, came to Philadelphia, a
                  few years ago, to seek his fortune. His name was Abiram Granger. He brought a
                  letter from the clergyman of the village where he had resided all his life, to a
                  merchant in the city. His first care was to present this introductory letter, when
                  Mr. Barker, the merchant, told him that he was just then in want of assistance,
                  and would be pleased to engage him at a moderate salary.
               On the next day, the young man went to Mr. Barker's store and entered upon his
                  duties. The merchant found him clear-headed, quick, and of good address; and
                  noticed, besides, that his sense of right was much keener than in men generally.
                  As, for instance, in selling an article, although he took pains to make the sale,
                  he never in the least exaggerated its quality. But Mr. Barker said to himselfâ€”
               "He will learn better than that, ere long. He will find that the seller has enough
                  to do to take care of his particular interests, and must leave the buyer to look
                  after his own concerns."
               One day, Granger had a customer to whom he was endeavouring to sell an article
                  that he could not praise very warmly.
               "Can you recommend this?" asked the buyer.
               "Frankly, I cannot," replied Granger.
               "Then I will not take it," said the customer, and went out.
               Barker overheard this, and, as soon as the man left, came to the side of his clerk
                  and saidâ€”
               "Why didn't he take it, Abiram?"
               "Because I could not recommend it as a first-rate article."
               "Did he ask you to do so?"
               "Yes."
               "I could have sold it," said the merchant.
               "And so could I, if I had told him a falsehood."
               "But I could have sold it without telling a direct falsehood."
               "How?" and the clear, earnest eyes of Granger were fixed upon the face of the
                  merchant.
               
               "By saying, for instance, that the article I believed to be very fair, as it came
                  from a good manufacturer's, and had cost within a fraction of what was asked for
                  it; or, that it was difficult to recommend any article in unequivocal terms, but
                  that, for all I knew to the contrary, this would give satisfaction. There are a
                  dozen ways in which to evade a direct question such as was asked of you; and this
                  secret you must learn, or you will never rise in the world."
               The last remark of Mr. Barker fixed itself upon the mind of Granger. He had an
                  ardent desire to rise in the world. Far was it from his idea to plod along through
                  life in an obscure position. He was ambitious to rise above the dead level of the
                  great mass, who are content with food and raiment. He had believed it possible to
                  attain the summit of his wishes without in the least compromising the honest
                  principles with which he had entered the world. The first question of this came
                  with the strange remark of Mr. Barkerâ€”strange, at least, to his ears. Never rise
                  in the world, if he did not learn the art of duplicity! Never rise in the world,
                  without laying aside the integrity of character which he had been taught to
                  believe would elevate a man to the highest place for which he might aspire, if he
                  had the intelligence to procure the means? His mind was startled and confused by
                  this.
               Granger was a young man, and Barker at least fifty-five. The latter had treated
                  him from the first with kindness and confidence, and he felt for him something
                  like affection as well as respect. His age gave weight to his wordsâ€”an undue
                  weight. Granger thought of them, and dreamed over them. He observed the other
                  young men in the store, and found that they made it a point to sell a customer as
                  much as possible; and, without absolutely lying to the extent of detection, to
                  exaggerate in regard to the quality of goods just sufficiently to secure a
                  sale.
               "And must I do this?" he asked of himself. "Is duplicity and covert falsehood
                  necessary in order to enable a man to rise in the world? Surely this cannot
                  be!"
               Yet from the time Mr. Barker told him that he could not rise in the world unless
                  he looked so closely at his own interests as not to see the interests of others,
                  Granger's manner towards customers changed. He no longer thought of justice to
                  them as well as justice to his employer. A few months later, and no one in the
                  store could drive a sharper bargain with a customer than he.
               "My old friend Lyon was right," remarked Barker to himself, as he looked on and
                  noted the shrewdness with which the young man conducted his sales to a large
                  country-dealer. "Granger will doubtless rise in the world. My word for it, he will
                  take care of himself, if ever he gets a fair chance."
               A couple of years in the store of Mr. Barker made Granger a shrewd and accomplished business-man.
                  There was no better salesman in the city.
               "Granger," said a partner in an old established house with which Mr. Barker dealt
                  pretty largely, "what are your future views in regard to business."
               "I have never yet clearly defined them," was replied.
               "Are you inclined to enter into business?" was next asked.
               "If I can make such arrangements as promise certain success. Not without."
               "Barker's country custom is large and good."
               "Yes, both large and good. We sell heavily to some of the best men in the
                  country."
               "So I thought. To what extent could you control this custom?"
               "To almost any extent, if I had enough capital to work with. To control custom, we
                  must have just such goods as customers want."
               "Then you are not averse to forming a business connection, if the required capital
                  is furnished?"
               "Not at all. My wish is to get into business for myself, as soon as I can see the
                  right kind of an opening."
               "You know my son, who has been for some time in our counting-room?"
               "Yes."
               "My wish is to associate him in business with a man who is well prepared to enter
                  into it with spirit and intelligence. I think you are such a man. I will furnish
                  any amount of capital that can be used safely. Will you turn this over in your
                  mind, and be prepared to tell me, in the course of a week, what your views are
                  upon the subject?"
               "I will," replied Granger, and the men separated.
               "Control his best custom," said Granger, musingly, to himself, as he sat alone in
                  his room that night, pondering over the proposition that had been made to him.
                  "Will that be altogether right? I believe I could take away the very cream of his
                  business; but would it be right to do so? Right! Where is the wrong? These men are
                  not sold to Barker; they are under no obligation to buy from him. If I go into
                  business, I must sell to men who have been somebody's customers. Anyhow, he has
                  money enough; it is time that he gave place to those who have their fortunes to
                  make. I shall not get another such offer soon, and I would be a fool not to accept
                  this."
               When Granger saw the merchant who had made the proposal, he was ready to treat
                  with him. It was finally agreed that he should remain with Mr. Barker during the
                  spring trade, in order to influence his best customers as much as possible, and
                  then get ready to open by fall with an entirely new and extensive assortment of
                  goods.
               When the customers of Mr. Barker received the circular of Granger & Grant, they very
                  generally felt inclined to encourage the new firm for the sake of Granger, who was
                  a favourite with nearly all of them. He had personally informed them of his
                  intention to go into business, backed by a heavy amount of capital, and promised
                  to sell them on a little better terms than Mr. Barker had ever given them. It is
                  not, therefore, at all surprising that a very large proportion of Barker's old
                  customers made pretty heavy bills with the new firm, where they bought, or at
                  least were made to believe that they bought, goods at much better rates than they
                  had been in the habit of obtaining at the old house.
               The effect of this upon the business of Mr. Barker was clearly marked. Instead of
                  selling some two hundred thousand dollars worth of goods in a year, his trade fell
                  off nearly one-half, and was not restored again. The mass of his old customers,
                  who had dealt with him for years, were drawn off by Granger, and his house was not
                  likely to make many new ones; but he did not know how industrious the young man
                  had been in sapping his business, nor suspect that unfair means had been used.
                  Even if he had known this, he would have had no just cause of complaint; for
                  having undermined the young man's principles, he could not be surprised if, in the
                  pursuit of his own interest, he disregarded that of every one elseâ€”his employer's
                  among the rest.
               "That Granger is going to be a rich man," said a neighbour to the old
                  merchant.
               "Yes," was the reply. "He's got the right kind of stuff in him, and is keen as a
                  razor at a bargain. In ten years from now, if he doesn't overreach himself, he
                  will be far in advance of most men in this street. Would you have believed it?
                  when he first came to me, he had a conscience quite as tender as a parson's. In
                  selling to a customer, he would be as careful to set forth all the defects as he
                  would the excellences of a piece of goods. He was for evenhanded justice all
                  around."
               "I should think you found him a great advantage to your establishment," said the
                  neighbour, appearing quite amused at the fact of a salesman putting the interest
                  of a customer upon a par with that of his employer.
               "Not much at first, I must own; but I saw that he was active, quick, shrewd, and
                  anxious to rise in the world, and I knew that all he wanted was a hint or two,
                  which I gave. After that, there was no more difficulty. He could sell as many
                  goods as any one in the store."
               "He's cutting into your business pretty seriously now, is he not?"
               "I'm afraid he is; but I suppose it's all right."
               "You sharpened him?" remarked the neighbour, with a significant expression.
               "Yes," was rather dryly answered. "And I rather think I have made him too keen even for myself," he added mentally.
               He was certainly right there.
               The young man with whom Granger had become associated in business was no match for
                  him in shrewdness, though active and industrious; and Granger soon managed to make
                  him as much a cipher in the concern as possible. In this there was a design. By
                  means of the capital which Grant could command, he knew that he could build up a
                  large business; and he meant, the moment his own share of profit in the concern
                  was large enough, added to his credit, to sustain him alone, to get rid of his
                  partner, and secure the entire income of the business to himself.
               The impression made by the new house upon the business of Mr. Barker, proved to be
                  a more serious matter than either Granger or the old merchant had anticipated. At
                  the close of the very first business season after the new firm had been fairly
                  launched upon the sea of trade, Barker had nearly fifty thousand dollars worth of
                  fall goods on hand, his purchases having exceeded his ordinary sales nearly that
                  amount; and upon these he lost much more than all his profits upon what he did
                  sell. In the spring he again miscalculated in buying, and in the ensuing fall
                  committed the same error. From that time, the tide fairly set against him; his
                  assortment of goods was not so large and tempting as it had been, and Granger
                  & Grant were all the rage among the country dealers.
               At the end of five years, Barker was worth just half what he was when he made the
                  successful attack upon his clerk's principles, in order to secure his own
                  interest. By that time, Granger considered himself quite strong enough to stand
                  alone in business, and began to reflect seriously upon the best mode of getting
                  rid of his partner, whom he now considered of about as much use as the fifth wheel
                  to a coach. In this, however, he rather underrated Mr. Grant, who had, in a
                  connection of five years with a man as keen for his own interest as was Granger,
                  cut, as the saying is, his eye-teeth. He was rather wider awake than his partner
                  suspected.
               Fifty thousand dollars, according to the books of the firm, had been made by each
                  member in the co-partnership. With a capital of fifty thousand dollars, and the
                  unlimited credit which he believed he could command, Granger felt that he could do
                  business enough to net at least twenty thousand dollars a year, and with that he
                  thought he would be satisfied. As to the custom of the house, he was sure that he
                  could take that with him. The capital which his partner had furnished, he
                  considered a small matter in comparison with his business talents and
                  facilities.
               After thinking of the matter for some time, and regarding it in all the aspects it
                  might possibly assume, Granger
                  determined to give notice of his wish to have the partnership terminate. When this
                  was done, he was rather surprised at the replyâ€”"Yes, I am aware that such is your
                  desire," made with the utmost coolness.
               "In what way did you gain this information?" asked Granger, exhibiting some
                  confusion.
               "From Mr. Archer," returned Grant, in his usual quiet way. "He mentioned it to me
                  some weeks ago."
               "He did?" ejaculated Granger, now colouring deeply.
               Archer was one of their best customers, to whom Granger had communicated what was
                  in his mind, in order to secure him when he got under way for himself.
               "Yes; and I have been expecting to hear from you on the subject daily, ever
                  since."
               "Then of course your mind is made up," said Granger.
               "Oh, yes. I am ready for a dissolution of the co-partnership; and, indeed, desire
                  it, since you have ceased to be content with the present arrangement."
               There was a coolness about Grant that Granger by no means liked; and he felt too
                  well assured that both he and his father were aware of the hand he was
                  endeavouring to play against them. The fact of Archer's having mentioned what he
                  had said to him, had forewarned them.
               The terms of settlement were by no means what Granger had anticipated. He had
                  supposed that his partner would be ready to pay him an estimated proportion of
                  profits, and continue the business. This would have given him the capital he
                  wanted, and he trusted to his own sagacity to enable him to draw off the best
                  custom to his new establishment; but Grant and his long-headed father understood
                  all this very well, and would listen to no proposition of the kind. The only thing
                  to which they would agree was a regular settlement of the business, each party to
                  receive his proportion of profit as fast as it was realized. As neither of the
                  partners was willing that the other should continue the business, it was finally
                  agreed that a trustee should be appointed to settle it up, and each party, in the
                  interim, be free to make what new arrangements he chose.
               A new arrangement was no difficult matter for Grant, whose father could furnish as
                  much capital as he wanted. In a month from the time a dissolution between him and
                  Granger was announced, the circulars of "Grant & Co., successors to Granger
                  & Grant," were flying over the country and their business spread before
                  three-fourths of the best custom of the old firm.
               Foiled in his scheme, Granger fully expected an advantageous offer to go into
                  business within a week after the announcement of his dissolution with Grant; but
                  in this he happened to be mistaken. The
                  surprise created by the dissolution, and especially by the terms of it, which
                  completely destroyed a large and flourishing business, set every one to asking
                  questions; and the father of Grant was very ready to give the true version, with
                  liberal embellishments and comments of his own. This was repeated with
                  exaggerations in business circles, and fixed upon Granger a reputation that made a
                  connection with him by no means desirable.
               By the end of a year, he had received fifteen thousand dollars from the old
                  business. The settlement progressed slowly, and the sequel proved that many bad
                  debts had been made.
               With this small capital, Granger determined to enter into business, feeling
                  confident that he could not only buy to any extent he might desire, but have as
                  many of his old customers as he wanted. In both these conclusions, he happened to
                  be in error. As a buyer, he found that Abiram Granger was not so potent a name as
                  that of the old firmâ€”Granger & Grant. During the first year in which he
                  carried on business in his own name, he received five thousand dollars from the
                  trustee of Granger & Grant, and lost five thousand dollars by buying too many
                  goods. In the second year, a final settlement of the old concern was made, and six
                  thousand dollars paid to him as the balance of profit. Instead of having made
                  fifty thousand dollars in five years, he realized but twenty thousand. This would
                  have been very well, if his cupidity had not unsettled his mind.
               Three years sufficed to wind up Granger's operations on his own account. In his
                  eagerness to do a large business, and to throw Grant & Co., if possible, into
                  the shade, he sold goods to almost every country merchant who came along, and
                  there were enough of doubtful credit to buy from him as much as he was willing to
                  sell them. The consequence was a total failure, and inability to pay over fifty
                  cents on the dollar, after having sunk his entire capital. And what was a little
                  singular, by the failure of Granger, Barker, who had first tampered with his
                  strictly honest principles, lost ten thousand dollars.
               The young man never got on his feet again, and is, to this day, a clerk on a
                  moderate salary, while the new firm of Grant & Co. are reputed to be worth
                  every cent of two hundred thousand dollars.
               So much for the subserviency of principle to interest. In the long run, strict
                  honesty is, doubtless, the best policy. The position taken by Barker, that the
                  seller must consult his own interest alone, and let the buyer take care of
                  himself, is not a just one; nor is the entire disregard of the buyer's interests
                  by any means necessary to success in business. Men generally think so; but we are
                  satisfied that it is an error more fatal to success than any one of the many
                  common errors that prevail among
                  business men. The direct result is often beneficial, but ultimate results, the
                  causes of which are too rarely seen and recognised, could they be traced back,
                  step by step, would show that the smallest act of overreaching is an injury
                  instead of a benefit.
            
            
               IS IT SAFE? IS IT HONEST?
               MARTIN AVERY had been in business about five years. His capital, in the beginning,
                  was small, and, in consequence, his operations were confined within a narrower
                  limit than suited his ambition. He often sighed for the credit which some of his
                  neighbours enjoyed; and frequently pondered on the ways and means for obtaining
                  like facilities in trade. The profits on Mr. Avery's business were not large; and
                  he had, therefore, to live plainly and frugally. His dwelling was obtained at a
                  moderate rent; his furniture was far from elegant; and he never gave fashionable
                  entertainments. Yet, for all this, his annual profits, after every expense was
                  paid, presented, to one of his temperament, a discouragingly small amount. Still,
                  he was gaining on the world; and, if he had known it, that was a good deal more
                  than all of his apparently flourishing neighbours were doing.
               "Why do you plod along after this fashion?" said an acquaintance to him one day.
                  "You ought to launch out and do a bigger business."
               "Haven't got the capital," was the frank reply.
               "Borrow it, then. There is plenty of capital in the market."
               "Yes, for those who have real estate to pledge."
               "That isn't always necessary. You may enlarge your facilities without any thing of
                  the kind. The fact is, Avery, you are too timid. You keep too near the shore. If
                  you expect to make a fortune, you must dash out, and attract attention. To be
                  frank with you, and to begin at the beginning, your style of living is too
                  plain."
               "It is quite as good as I can afford."
               "How much house-rent do you pay?"
               "Two hundred and fifty dollars."
               "And what for your store?"
               "Seven hundred."
               "A wide difference."
               "But the store-rent comes as an expense upon my business. I must have a good stand
                  and a handsome store, if I expect to get custom."
               "And if you expect to get liberal credits, you must have a handsome dwelling, and
                  live as a man who is prospering in trade would be expected to live. Add a couple
                  of hundred dollars to your house-rent, and call it an unavoidable business
                  expense, if you will. Buy elegant furniture on the same principle; and give a grand party once or twice a
                  year. Depend upon it, all this is just as necessary to success as a store
                  handsomely fitted up and in a good situation."
               "I never took that view of it," said Avery.
               "Just the reason why you have progressed so slowly. Every one is ready to push on
                  the successful. Every one is ready to sell liberally to those who give out the
                  signs of success, whether they are, at first, real or not. I started on this plan,
                  with less capital than you began with; and now I own the elegant house in which I
                  live, and consider myself worth every cent of forty thousand dollars. There was a
                  time when I spent in my living twice as much as I made in the year. But I
                  understood clearly the game I was playing; and all has come out right."
               "There is some reason in what you say, I must own," remarked Avery, upon whose
                  mind a new light was breaking.
               "There is a great deal of reason in it, let me tell you. All you have to do is to
                  thrown out the signs of success, and then every one will believe you are making a
                  fortune. At New Year's, no matter how your business may stand, put on a cheerful
                  air, and tell a few of your friends, confidentially of course, that you have made,
                  during the previous twelve-month, a clear profit of fifteen thousand dollars. They
                  will believe it, and so will eight out of ten to whom they relate the story of
                  your success."
               "I should call that lying," said Avery.
               "Call it what you please," returned the other, shrugging his shoulders. "It's the
                  way the thing is done. You know Tompkins?"
               "Yes."
               "To my certain knowledge, he lost, year before last, more than his whole profit
                  for two years. Did he look grave about it? Not he! He gave out that he had cleared
                  over thirty thousand dollars; and what is more, people believed him. The
                  consequence was, that every one was ready to sell to a merchant who had been so
                  successful; and his paper was A No. 1 in the market. An almost unlimited credit
                  enabled him to double his business during the past year, and to fully redeem
                  himself. Now, suppose he had put on a long face about the matter, and let the
                  truth leak out. He would have been ruined."
               "Probably. But I can hardly think it right to make so deliberate a
                  falsification."
               "As to its being right or wrong," replied the friend, "that I leave for persons of
                  tender consciences to determine. If you begin to stickle on matters of this kind,
                  you had better quit business at once; for you know as well as I do, that, in
                  almost every transaction we make, there is a reservation or affirmation that is
                  really meant to deceive those with whom we are dealing. Let the whole truth of
                  your circumstances be known, or tell precisely the character ter of your goods, and your business will diminish
                  instead of increasing."
               "I'm afraid there is some truth in your remark," said Avery, half sighing as he
                  spoke. "People will be deceived."
               "And we have to deceive them."
               The young merchant pondered over what was said on this occasion, long and
                  seriously. And the more he thought of it, the more did he feel inclined to adopt
                  at least some of the suggestions offered; particularly those in regard to his
                  style of living. It took him some time to make up his mind to do this. He had been
                  able, at the close of each year, to determine a clear profit of one or two
                  thousand dollars, limited as he considered his business; but, while his neighbours
                  were making their ten and twenty thousand dollars, annually, this seemed like mere
                  plodding. He had tried to extend his credit, but those with whom he dealt rather
                  held back, and he thought it prudent not to urge the matter. Several times, he had
                  thrown into the bank, where he kept his account, good notes; but only on two or
                  three occasions did he succeed in obtaining discounts. He was not of sufficient
                  importance in the business community to receive favours of this kind. And so he
                  had moved along, quietly, slowly, but safely. His business, though not large, was
                  healthy, and entirely within his control; and, with prudence and economy in
                  personal matters, promised in the end to become large and prosperous. But the time
                  seemed very far away, and he naturally grew impatient.
               Soon after the interview just mentioned, Avery began to speak more frequently to
                  others of his business, and to talk of the handsome profits he was making. This,
                  once begun, was easily continued. The most difficult thing was to commence a
                  system of exaggeration; all came easy enough after that. Like a stream which is
                  small in the beginning, but increases as it flows on, the new system adopted by
                  Avery assumed, ere long, quite an imposing form. As his prompter in the matter had
                  said, so it turned out; people really believed all that he said. And, further,
                  those who had goods to sell were more urgent for him to increase his bills, and
                  some offered him a more liberal credit than they had before been willing to
                  extend.
               Avery felt a little surprised, although he had made an effort to produce just this
                  effect.
               "He was right, after all," he remarked to himself, while turning over the matter
                  in his thoughts. "How easily people are deceived! I could hardly have believed
                  that a little bragging would have produced such a change. If our wholesale dealers
                  are to be caught with such chaff, they shall have enough of it."
               After once entering upon this system of deception, Avery saw no evil in it. To
                  increase his business ness facilities
                  was a thing of the utmost importance, and if it was to be done so easily, and
                  without, as he said to himself, hurting any one, of course there was no harm in a
                  little exaggeration.
               "Still hiding yourself away," said the individual that had tempted Avery from the
                  right path. "Why don't you come forward, socially, as you are evidently doing in a
                  business point of view? I heard Felt-well and Glenn say of you, the other day,
                  that you were bound to make a fortune."
               "Ah! I hope they may prove true prophets."
               "Of course they will, if you are wise enough to improve the opportunities placed
                  within your reach."
               "Why did they say this?"
               "I spoke of the handsome business you were doing, and they not only agreed with
                  me, but volunteered to predict the ultimate result."
               "They were always very careful not to sell me beyond a certain limit."
               "That was before you gave out that you were doing a handsome business. You needn't
                  fear now. They will sell you as freely as you like."
               "The last time I was in their store, they had a great many goods to show me, and
                  were exceedingly affable."
               "Of course. They see the wind in your sails, and imagine you to be going just
                  twice as fast as you are. Now, you must keep up this illusion. A man who is doing
                  well, generally lives well. Your next step must be to exhibit a style of living in
                  correspondence with your supposed condition. You must move into a handsome house,
                  buy handsome furniture, and let the people see the evidence of your
                  prosperity."
               "It costs something to do that."
               "I know it does; but it is so much money well laid out, and will come back to you
                  in due time."
               Thus instigated, Avery, after turning the matter over and over in his mind,
                  concluded that his friend was right. And so a house at five hundred dollars was
                  taken, and a thousand dollars worth of new furniture purchased.
               "That Avery's getting along," said one and another, as this new sign of prosperity
                  appeared.
               "He's active, shrewd, and persevering," would be replied. "He's sure to make his
                  fortune."
               Yet, how did the case actually stand? Why, thus: In consequence of having boasted
                  of the fine profits he was making, several houses with whom he dealt were led to
                  offer him tempting inducements to enlarge his purchases, and he had done so. In
                  fact, he had bought at least a third more goods than during a like period in the
                  preceding year. There are two important operations in businessâ€”buying and selling.
                  If a man buys freely, he must also sell freely; and it is always easier to buy
                  than to sell. Hitherto, Mr. Avery had done a very safe business; all his customers
                  were good, and bought from him at
                  prices that paid him a fair profit. But now, having increased his stock of goods
                  by liberal purchases on credit, it became necessary to exert himself a little more
                  in the selling department; a man may sell a great many goods, if he is not over
                  careful as to the ability of those to whom he sells. This Avery also found out;
                  his eagerness to sell, led him into the error of giving credit where he had before
                  deemed it wise to withhold it, or only to sell in small amounts. Bills accumulated
                  in his pocket-book, and, as heavier payments than usual began, after a few months,
                  to fall due, he found it necessary to turn these bills into cash. So he threw some
                  of them into the bank where he kept his account. A little to his surprise, for he
                  didn't calculate very confidently on getting the money for them, they were
                  discounted. There were among the directors of the bank, two or three men who
                  happened to have observed his prosperous indications, and they said a word in his
                  favour.
               A doubt had crossed the mind of Avery as to the wisdom of the course he had
                  adopted. It vanished now. A year before, this same bank had repeatedly rejected
                  all his offerings; now it recognised him as one worth regarding. He laughed to
                  himself, and went on his way.
               The result of the two years' operations following immediately after this change in
                  Avery's system of doing business was not as flattering to the young man as he had
                  hoped it would be. New furniture, increased rent, a more expensive style of
                  living, and certain extravagances of his wife to which he consented, such as a
                  gold watch, diamond pin, rich and costly clothing, and the like, abstracted from
                  his capital, during the time, a sum that did not fall very short of five thousand
                  dollars. All this was but a part of the system of putting on an appearance of
                  prosperity for the sake of inspiring business confidence.
               It is no matter of surprise, that Avery found, in the course of three or four
                  years, that, instead of driving his business, his business was driving him. Having
                  once left the safe and sure way, he met with temptations at every stepâ€”temptations
                  to enlarge and extend his operations. Enlargement and extension created new
                  obligations, and to meet these, when they came due, was not always the easiest
                  matter in the world. A system of money-raising, through divers expedients, was
                  adjoined to his regular business, and required actually more of his time and
                  occupied more of his thoughts than his ordinary mercantile transactions.
               Still, he counted his profits by thousands, and every year threw out some new sign
                  of prosperity, meant to conceal the actual state of his affairs, which was nearer
                  being desperate than he imagined. In extravagant living, he had
                  consumed more than all his real profits, and, by forcing sales, he had made many
                  bad debts. The enlargement of his ideas
                  had caused him to make bolder, and, consequently, more imprudent operations; all
                  of which helped to make his position as a merchant far from being a safe one.
                  Indeed, at the very time that he boasted of clearing twenty thousand dollars a
                  year, he was actually bankrupt. Yet people, taking him at his word, believed him
                  to be making a fortune. While an honest, prudent man, whose small business was
                  making an actual profit every year over and above all his expenses, could not get
                  an accommodation in bank for one hundred dollars, he could draw out his thousands!
                  And why? Because he deceived by false appearances. In fact, his whole business and
                  domestic life was a lie! In order to keep up a good credit, he resorted to this,
                  among other tricks. He kept three bank accounts; and generally passed the same
                  money through them all. Having obtained a discount in one of these banks, or made
                  collections through it, he drew out the money and deposited it in another bank
                  with which he did business. After letting it lie here for one or two days, a part
                  or the whole was deposited in another bank; and it generally came back to the
                  first before it was finally used. In order still further to make a good
                  impression, he frequently borrowed sums of money for a few days, and passed them
                  into bank, where they were permitted to lie until the day came round for them to
                  be returned, when he handed checks to the parties from whom the loans had been
                  obtained. All this was done to give the appearance of a large business.
               In the midst of this experiment, and at a time when it was on the eve of proving a
                  failure, a widow, named Barclay, who had received some property, called upon him,
                  and asked him to give her some directions in regard to its safe and profitable
                  investment. She had three children to raise and educate, and the property which
                  had just been obtained, after a prolonged suit at law, was but ten thousand
                  dollars.
               On the very day upon which this lady called to see Avery, he had been making some
                  pretty close calculations in regard to his business, and the result caused him to
                  feel rather serious. The amount of money to pay, in the coming three or four
                  months, was most appalling. How it was to be raised, he could not imagine. Already
                  he had strained his credit, in the way of accommodations, as far as he deemed it
                  prudent to go; and no new resource opened before his searching mind. Mrs.
                  Barclay's visit appeared, therefore, quite opportune. The moment she announced the
                  fact that she had ten thousand dollars to invest, he made up his mind to get the
                  use of it in his business, if possible; and commenced, immediately, his approaches
                  towards that point. He first made kind inquiries into the particulars of her
                  circumstances, manifesting a lively sympathy at every step of her relation. Thus
                     he became aware of the fact that
                  these ten thousand dollars made up the whole amount of her property, and that in
                  the income therefrom she was to find the means of raising and educating her
                  children.
               "You ought to have more than four or five hundred dollars for that purpose," said
                  Avery, evincing much interest in the widow.
               "Very true," she replied. "And will I not be able to get a better interest than
                  that?"
               "Not in the ordinary investments. Ground-rents are safe, but from these you would
                  not, probably, receive, after deducting taxes, over four hundred dollars, perhaps
                  not so much."
               Mrs. Barclay shook her head disapprovingly.
               "Stocks pay five or six per cent., and sometimes more; but so much money has been
                  lost on stocks, that I, for one, feel afraid of them."
               "So do I," returned Mrs. Barclay. "I know several persons who have lost their all
                  in this way. I wouldn't like to put my money out in stocks of any kind. Don't real
                  estateâ€”houses, I meanâ€”pay well?"
               "Not such as you can buy. Taxes, repairs, insurance, and a dozen other expenses,
                  run away with half the rent at least."
               "Some one mentioned that Government securities were desirable as an
                  investment."
               "So they are, if you have enough money to invest. But you, madam, ought to have at
                  least a thousand dollars income, and United States scrip will not pay you over
                  half that."
               "Yes, I ought to have a thousand dollars income," said the widow, and she looked
                  thoughtful and serious.
               "There is one way in which you might obtain a better income from your little
                  property," said Avery, after seeming to reflect for some moments.
               "What is that?" was eagerly inquired.
               "Money is worth more in business than in any other way; which is one reason why
                  men, who have capital at their command, engage in business. There are many
                  substantial merchants who are always using extra capital; some of these would, no
                  doubt, be willing to receive your money, and pay you ten per cent. for its use;
                  they would make thirty out of it, perhaps fifty. In this way you would realize
                  more than in any other mode, and your money would be as safe."
               "Do you think so?"
               "Oh, yes, quite as safe; some of our business men are as substantial as rocks.
                  Many of them clear from fifty to a hundred thousand dollars yearly."
               "Indeed!"
               "Yes. My own profit last year was twenty thousand dollars; and I shall be
                  disappointed if it does not reach thirty thousand by the close of the present
                  year."
               
               "Is it possible?"
               "Oh, yes. Fortunes are made rapidly by those who understand how to conduct
                  business. Capital often doubles itself in a year."
               "Then you think the best thing I can do, is to lend my money to some safe
                  merchant?"
               "In that way, madam, you will obtain a better income; which, to you, is a matter
                  of the first importance."
               "It certainly is. Do you know of any one who would take it, and pay me the
                  interest you mentioned?"
               "Well, no, I can't say that I do. There are plenty who would gladly enough take
                  your money, but it wouldn't be safe to trust them. If you invest it in this way,
                  it should be only with some one of undoubted substantiality."
               "Couldn't you find profitable use for that much additional capital in
                  your business?" asked Mrs. Barclay.
               Now this was coming to the point much quicker than Avery had any idea that the
                  lady would arrive there, and he was hardly prepared with just the appropriate
                  answer. However, he thought hurriedly, and, after a short silence, repliedâ€”"I
                  scarcely know what answer to make to that question, Mrs. Barclay. I might make use
                  of more capital with advantage; but my bank facilities are large, and money
                  obtained from bank only costs six per cent."
               "But, if money pays from thirty to fifty per cent. in business, I should suppose
                  it would be worth your while to use it freely."
               "True; and I should very much like to accommodate you, especially when taking your
                  circumstances into consideration."
               Mr. Avery mused for some moments.
               "Say you will take my money at ten per cent., and all is settled at once," urged
                  Mrs. Barclay; who, crediting every word the unscrupulous merchant had said, really
                  believed that he was one of the most substantial men in the city.
               After a good deal of apparent hesitation, and the utterance of many objections,
                  all of which tended to make the lady feel more anxious to have him take her money,
                  Avery at last consented to receive it as a permanent loan, on an interest of ten
                  per cent., and with no other security for it than his simple written
                  acknowledgment of the debt.
               All this was done by Mrs. Barclay without consultation with a third party. She had
                  heard a gentleman, in the same business with Mr. Avery, speak of the large amount
                  of money he had made in a few years, and predict that he would be one of the
                  richest men in the city before he died. As Mr. Avery was a friend of her deceased
                  husband, who had always spoken well of him, she concluded that he would be the one
                  whom she could trust for sound advice in the matter of investing her little
                     estate. When he agreed to take her
                  money, and pay her ten per cent. for its use, she felt happy; she was now sure of
                  an income sufficient to enable her to support and educate her children. Judge,
                  then, of her surprise, when, a few days after the arrangement was affected, she
                  heard a gentleman, who belonged to the old slow-and-sure-school of merchants,
                  reply to some remark made about Avery, in a way that threw over her mind a doubt
                  as to his substantiality. He was referred to as the purchaser, at a public sale on
                  the day previous, of an elegant residence.
               This had been determined upon as soon as he obtained possession of the widow's
                  money. He did not feel the need of a house of his ownâ€”he was comfortable enough in
                  all things pertaining to domestic affairs; but having so unexpectedly obtained
                  possession of ten thousand dollars, he deemed it a wise move to put on, by the
                  purchase of a handsome house, still further appearances of wealth. The amount of
                  purchase-money to be paid down in cash was but five thousand dollars, and it was
                  an easy matter, as he reasoned with himself, to get it all back into his business
                  again by means of a mortgage. To live in a beautiful house of his own, would, he
                  believed, still further increase the public confidence, and widen the range of his
                  credit.
               The remark made by the individual just referred to wasâ€”"He'd better keep his money
                  in his business. Young merchants would oftener succeed, if they were governed by
                  Poor Richard's sensible advice to little boats."
               "He has already succeeded," said Mrs. Barclay.
               "So people think."
               "Don't you think so?" inquired the lady.
               "People never succeeded, when I was a young man, in the way he and dozens of
                  others around him do business. But perhaps they have found out a secret which we
                  didn't know. This is the age of improvements."
               No more was said; but the lady felt troubled. She went, on the next day, to see
                  the gentleman who had spoken so confidently in regard to Mr. Avery's
                  substantiality, and frankly told him what she had done.
               "What security did he give you?" was his first question.
               "None at all. I didn't require any."
               "That was wrong."
               "He is perfectly safe."
               "I don't know. It is a mental reservation with us merchants, that no man is really
                  safe. Business is but a precarious matter, after all. I believe Mr. Avery to be
                  sound enough, and, in proof of this, would sell him as many goods as he might feel
                  disposed to purchase; but I would do this with all the risks of business taken
                  into the calculation. With you it is different. Your money is your all, and should
                  not be invested without the most ample security rity. You had better see Mr. Avery, and tell him
                  that a friend advised you to ask him for security."
               "I don't like to do that; it would seem like throwing a doubt upon his integrity.
                  Even if any thing should happen to his business, I don't believe he would let me
                  suffer."
               "Make no calculation of that kind. When a merchant gets into difficulties, he
                  usually struggles on until he is so tied, hand and foot, that he can do nothing.
                  He may mean to secure many such debts as yours, without being able to do so. No,
                  no, madam. You must get ample security now, and he is bound to give it. A few days
                  ago, he purchased a large and beautiful house. Insist upon having a mortgage of
                  that property."
               "I offered him the money, and almost forced it upon him," said Mrs. Barclay; "how,
                  then, can I go to him and ask what you suggest? He would be, and with cause,
                  offended."
               "No matter. You have committed an error, and must, therefore, bear the unpleasant
                  consequences. There is too much at stake to let the matter rest where it is."
               "Do you speak knowingly when you say this?" asked Mrs. Barclay, turning slightly
                  pale.
               "Why, no," replied the friend. "But, as I said, business is always precarious,
                  especially as it is conducted in these times; and Mr. Avery is one of those men
                  who go upon the high-pressure principle. If he escape an explosion, he will make a
                  splendid fortune; if not, he will make a splendid failure. That's my opinion of
                  him."
               And yet this very man, in the prevailing spirit of exaggeration, had said so much
                  in Avery's favour as an enterprising, successful, and substantial merchant, that
                  Mrs. Barclay's mind was carried, in regard to him, entirely beyond the feeling of
                  a doubt.
               To see Avery and demand security, was a thing that the widow could not do. She had
                  volunteered her confidence, and now, to go forward and forcibly withdraw it was so
                  like an insult, that her mind shrank from the thought. But she was deeply
                  troubled. For two or three years she had striven to keep her little ones around
                  her, and had succeeded in doing so, but at the expense of health. The decision of
                  the court, made at last in her favour, gave her sufficient property, if invested
                  safely, and the income therefrom prudently dispensed, to raise her little family,
                  and give them the blessing of a good education. But now, all was uncertain again.
                  Her money had passed from her hands, and she had no security for its return but
                  the word and bond of a man who might not be able to fulfil his obligation.
               While the widow's mind was in this state of distressing doubt, there occurred a
                  large failure in the city. The merchant whose career came thus suddenly denly to a close, was the very one who
                  had tempted Avery from the partially obscure, but safe path in which he was
                  treading. At every step in the new way, this man had been near Avery, with
                  suggestions and propositions; and it was not long after the latter began to move
                  on at the new and more rapid pace, before mutual money engagements were made, and
                  the two played into each other's hand in the way of endorsements and such-like
                  matters. When the failure took place at last, Avery was so hopelessly involved
                  with his enterprising friend, that his stoppage became also necessary.
               When this last news reached the widow's ears, she became half frantic with alarm.
                  Her first step was to go to Avery.
               "Don't be alarmed, madam," said he, the moment he saw her; "you are safe enough. I
                  am ruined entirely, through the failure of another; but you are safe. Borrowed
                  money is always considered as a preferred debt."
               Thus he pushed her off, and partially quieted her agitation of mind. An
                  examination into the merchant's affairs exhibited a condition of things undreamed
                  of; his personal expenses had been over five thousand dollars for several
                  yearsâ€”far more than all his real profits. Forced loans at exorbitant interest, and
                  a wide range of bad debts, added to the heavy amount of discounted paper in which
                  he was involved by the recent failure, left the probable per centage on his real
                  assets so low as to fill every creditor with hopelessness and amazement.
               "What are my chances?" asked Mrs. Barclay, with trembling interest, of a
                  gentleman, at whose house she awaited a report from the first meeting of
                  creditors.
               "Not worth a copper," was the reply. "His whole assets would hardly pay your
                  claim. I never saw such a total wreck. No man who has gone on as wildly as he has
                  doneâ€”no man who has lied so about the real state of his business, can be
                  honest."
               Poor Mrs. Barclay! What could she do but cover her face with her hands and weep? A
                  deeper darkness than she had yet known fell upon her spirits. From the mountain of
                  hope, she was dashed headlong into the dark valley of despair. As for Avery, he
                  saw, when it was too late, that he had acted with most unpardonable folly, thereby
                  ruining himself, and involving others in a like calamity. He had started in
                  business with the belief that it was possible to succeed, and yet be governed in
                  every thing by a strict regard to truth and honesty. Under that system, he was
                  getting on very well; he was slowly but surely laying the foundation for future
                  prosperity. But the false appearances put on by those around him, who lived beyond
                  their means in order to create a factitious confidence, and thereby enlarge their
                  credits, tempted him from his safe course, and he was soon upon the troubled sea
                  of trade, almost without rudder or
                  compass. That he made shipwreck, is by no means a matter of surprise.
               A few weeks after the unhappy Mrs. Barclay had learned the hopelessness of her
                  case, she was sitting alone, brooding over her sad condition. The pleasant little
                  house into which she had removed, and where she had hoped to find a home with her
                  children for years, must now be given up, for she had no means of paying the rent.
                  What was she to do? Her little ones were all asleep and happy; but, in a month
                  from that time, would she have a home for them? The thought made her weep.
               "A gentleman wishes to see you in the parlour," said her domestic, coming to the
                  door.
               "Who is it?" she inquired, looking up with wet eyes.
               "His name is Mr. Avery."
               "Mr. Avery?"
               "Yes, ma'am; that was the name he gave."
               "Tell him I will see him in a few minutes."
               Mrs. Barclay composed herself as best she could, and in about five minutes went
                  down to the parlour. Mr. Avery looked haggard.
               "Madam," he said, as he arose and offered her his hand, "I am ruined, but you are
                  safe."
               "Me!" exclaimed the widow. "Oh, sir, do not create false hopes."
               "I believe what I say, ma'am. I have just left a meeting of my creditors, at which
                  I plead your cause so earnestly, that I succeeded in getting a decision in your
                  favour. Your claim is to be paid in full. I could not rest until I brought you
                  this good news."
               Surprise, gratitude, and delight kept the widow silent for some moments. When she
                  sought to give utterance to her feelings, sobs choked her.
               "I conducted business on a false principle," said Mr. Avery, during the brief
                  interview held with Mrs. Barclay, "and failure has been the result. Now, heavily
                  burdened with a debt that I can never pay, I go forth into the world with no means
                  of supporting my family but what lie in my own unaided individual efforts. I have
                  received a bitter lesson, but it is learned, I fear, too late. Perhaps, the only
                  pleasant feeling I shall ever have, in referring to this period in my life, will
                  arise from the fact that your little property was saved, not lost."
               And it was saved. A generous feeling among the wronged creditors, when they
                  understood the case of Mrs. Barclay, led them to forego a trifling advantage each,
                  that she might not lose her all.
               Hundreds of men act upon the principle that Avery adopted in business; and
                  hundreds who do adopt it, fail in the end, where one succeeds. To act from such a
                  principle is NEITHER SAFE NOR HONEST.
            
            
               
               HARMLESS GLASS OF WINE.
               "ROSE, dear," said Mrs. Carlton to her daughter, whom she met at the door of the
                  dining-room with a decanter of wine and glasses on a waiter, "who is in the
                  parlour?"
               "Mr. Newton," replied the young girl.
               "The young man from New York?"
               "Yes."
               "You are going to take him wine?"
               "Yes. It is only hospitable to offer him some refreshment."
               Mrs. Carlton stood with her eyes resting on the floor for some moments, in a
                  thoughtful attitude.
               "I rather think, Rose," said she, as she lifted her eyes to her daughter's face,
                  "that it would be as well not to hand him wine."
               "Why, mother?" inquired Rose, looking curious.
               "We know nothing of the young man's previous life and habits."
               "Why do you say that, mother?" asked Rose, who did not comprehend the meaning of
                  what had been uttered.
               "He may have been intemperate."
               "Mother, how can you imagine such a thing?"
               "I know nothing of him whatever, my child," replied Mrs. Carlton, "and do not wish
                  to wrong him by an unkind suspicion. My suggestion is nothing more than the
                  dictate of a humane prudence. We never can know whose perverted taste we may
                  inflame, when we set even wine before guests of whose history we know nothing; it
                  is therefore wiser to restrain. But you have left Mr. Newton alone, and must not
                  linger here; do not, however, present him with wine. After he is gone, we will
                  talk on this subject again, when I think you will be satisfied that my present
                  advice is good."
               Rose left the wine on the sideboard, and went back to the parlour, wondering at
                  what she had heard. After the young man had gone away, she joined her mother, when
                  the latter saidâ€”"You seemed surprised at my remarks a little while ago; and I was,
                  perhaps, as much surprised when like suggestions were made to me; but when, from
                  indisputable evidence, we become aware that our actions may wrong others, we are
                  bound, by every consideration, to guard against such injurious results. You know
                  how painfully afflicted the family of Mr. Delaney has been, in consequence of the
                  intemperate habits of Morton?"
               "Yes. Poor Flora! The last time I was with her, he passed us in the street so much
                     intoxicated that he almost
                  staggered. Her heart was so full that she could not speak, and when I left her, a
                  little while afterward, her eyes were ready to gush over with tears."
               "Unhappy young man! So young, and yet so abandoned."
               "Until I met him, as just said, I thought he had reformed his bad habit of
                  drinking," said Rose.
               "It was in order to refer to this fact that I mentioned his name just now,"
                  returned her mother. "He did attempt to do better, and for some months kept fast
                  hold of his good resolutions; but, in an evil hour, he fell, and his temptress was
                  a young girl of your own age, Rose. A few weeks ago, he went to New York on
                  business; while there, he visited the house of a relative, where wine was
                  presented to him by a beautiful cousin, and he had not the resolution to refuse
                  the sparkling draught. He tasted, andâ€”you have seen the result."
               "Oh, mother," exclaimed Rose, "I would not have that cousin's feelings for the
                  world."
               "She acted as innocently as you would have done just now, my daughter."
               "Was she not aware of his weakness?"
               "No; nor had she ever been told that, for one whose taste is vitiated, it is
                  dangerous, in the highest degree, to take even a glass of wine."
               "I am so glad that I did not offer wine to Mr. Newton," said Rose, drawing a long
                  breath.
               "Mr. Newton," returned the mother, "may never have used intoxicating drinks to
                  excess; he may not be in danger from a glass of wine: but I know nothing of his
                  previous life, and, therefore, it is wisest to take counsel of prudence. This is
                  just what I want you to see for yourself. To such an extent has intemperance
                  prevailed in this country, that the whole community, to a certain extent, have
                  perverted appetites, which are excited so inordinately by any kind of stimulating
                  drink as to destroy, in too many instances, all self-control. Another case, even
                  more painful to contemplate than that of Morton Delaney, occurred in this city,
                  last week; I heard of it a day or two since. A beautiful young girl was addressed
                  by a gentleman who had recently removed here from the South; and her friends,
                  seeing nothing about him to warrant disapprobation, made no objection to his suit.
                  An engagement soon followed, and the wedding was celebrated a few days ago. The
                  father of the bride gave a brilliant entertainment to a large and elegant company;
                  the choicest wines were used more freely than water, and the young husband drank
                  with the rest. Alas! before the evening closed, he was so much intoxicated that he
                  had to be separated from the company; and, what is worse, he has not been sober
                  for an hour since."
               "Oh, what a sad, sad thing!" exclaimed Rose.
               "It is sad, sad indeed! What an awakening from a dream of exquisite happiness was
                  that of the beautiful bride! It now
                  appears that the young man had fallen into habits of dissipation, and after-wards
                  reformed. On his wedding-night, he could not refuse a glass of wine; a single
                  draught sufficed to rekindle the old fire, that was smouldering, not extinguished.
                  He fell, and, so far, has not risen from his fall, and may never rise."
               "You frighten me," said Rose, while a shudder went through her frame; "I never
                  dreamed of such danger in a glass of wine. Pure wine I have always looked upon as
                  a good thing. I did not think that it would lead any one into danger."
               "Even the best of things, my child, may be turned to an evil purpose. The heat and
                  light of the sun are received by one plant and changed into a poison, while
                  another converts it into healthy and nourishing food. Pure wine will not excite a
                  healthy appetite, although it may madden one that has become morbid through
                  intemperance. Here is the distinction that ought to be made."
               "Is it not dangerous, then, to serve wine in promiscuous companies?"
               "Undoubtedly. I did not think so, a little while ago, because the subject was not
                  presented to my mind in the light that it now is. To this custom I can well
                  believe that hundreds, who had begun the work of restricting their craving
                  appetites, owe their downfall. Where all are partaking, the temptation to join in
                  it is almost irresistible; especially, as a refusal fusal might create a suspicion
                  against the individual that he was afraid to trust himself."
               "I will be very careful how I offer wine to any one again," said Rose. "I would
                  not have the guilt of tempting a man to ruin upon my conscience, for all the
                  world."
               The visits of Mr. Newton to Rose, which at first were only occasional, became more
                  and more frequent. A mutual attachment ensued, which ended in marriage. No wine
                  was provided at the wedding partyâ€”to many, a strange omissionâ€”and Rose observed
                  that, at the parties given by friends, her husband invariably let the wine pass
                  him untasted. Curious to know the reason for such abstemiousness, she one day,
                  some months after marriage, said to himâ€”"Do you never drink wine?"
               The question caused Newton to look serious, and he replied in a simple
                  monosyllable.
               "Don't you like it?" inquired Rose.
               "Yes; too well, perhaps."
               The way in which this was said, half-startled the young wife. Newton saw the
                  effect of his words, and, forcing a smile, saidâ€”"When quite a young man, I was
                  thrown much into gay company, and there acquired a bad habit of using all kinds of
                  intoxicating drinks with a dangerous freedom. Before I was conscious of my error,
                  I was verging on rapidly to the point of losing all self-control. Startled at
                  finding myself in such a position, I made a resolution tion to abandon the use of every thing but wine.
                  This, however, did not reach the evil. The taste of wine excited my appetite to
                  such a degree that I invariably resorted to brandy for its gratification. I then
                  abandoned the use of wine, as the only safe course for me, and, with occasional
                  exceptions, have strictly adhered to my resolution. In a few instances, young
                  ladies, at whose houses I visited, have presented me with wine; and, not wishing
                  to push back the proffered refreshment, I have tasted it. The consequence was
                  invariable. A burning desire for stronger stimulants was awakened, that carried me
                  away as by an irresistible power. You, Rose, never tempted me in this way; had you
                  done so, we might not have been as happy as we are to-day."
               A shudder passed through the frame of the young wife, as she remembered the glass
                  of wine she had been so near presenting to his lips. Never afterward could she
                  think of it without an inward tremour, and fears for the future mingled with her
                  thoughts of the past; but these have proved ground-less fears, for Mr. Newton has
                  no temptation at home, and he has resolution enough to refuse a glass of wine in
                  any company, and on all occasions. Herein lies his safety.
            
            THE END.
