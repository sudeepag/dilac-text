                           Of what he was, what is, and what must be
                           Worse, if worse deeds, worse sufferings must ensue."
                        
                     
                     MILTON'S PARADISE LOST.
                  
               
               "Yes, that is all I can do," I said, after long thinking how to atone for my misdeeds. "Show to others the rocks on which I was wrecked, that they. may avoid the fate I must suffer."
               In this gloomy cell, in which I have spent so many heavy, cruel moments! here, where reflection held up the mirror into which the mind's eye gazed, and shrank appalled and horror-stricken at the fearful images presented!—theft—forgery—kidnapping—murder! and by whom? One who once was pure as erring humanity could be; free from guilt, happy, honest, virtuous, content. Now—O, how terrible the thought!—soon to die an ignominious death, as an atonement for crimes that my now awakened soul shudders at!
               After much deliberation, I have concluded to write a short sketch of my accursed career; and after my death, hope it may be published. Perhaps it will be the means of inducing others, who have started on the road to the gallows—dissipation—and who are not entirely hardened, to pause in their career, and be warned by my terrible fate.

                           A judge is just, a chancellor juster still;

                     POPE.
                  
               
               I was born in Boston, in the year 1818. My father was an importer, and doing an immense business, and was highly esteemed by all. My mother was a mother, indeed, of whom I now scarce think, for my sins rise up, and cast a horrid vail over her, and I see her not, even in my mind's eye. O, it is indeed a joy to my wretched soul to think she can never know how her idol lived, bow shameful was his death.
               I received a liberal education, was furnished with whatever I desired, drew on my father for whatever money I might choose, and the draft never was dishonored. Of course, one so favored as I, drew the buzzards of society around me; and there was no dissipation. no deviltry, or fashionable trick, that I did not have share in. But of this my parents were ignorant and imagined me to be a pattern of goodness; and it was this very indulgence, and unlimited use of money, which paved the way to ruin.
               When I was eighteen years old, my mother left this sorrowing world, and walked in the dark valley and shadow of death. O, how I wept! It seemed as if my better genius was torn from me, and the evil left to reign and riot unrestrained. I reformed. Her blessed memory kept me in the path of rectitude, and shone upon my way; but it was only for a time.
               My father's half brother had an only son, who was an orphan, and had been left dependent upon my father. He was treated like myself; received the same education, same command of money; but he was of a different disposition; he was born a scoundrel, and nature intended him for a villain. He envied me the wealth which he knew must be mine at my father's death, and was determined that I never should possess it. He never acted openly until after mother's death, for he feared her eyes would see his villainy. But after that calamity, he, by hints and inuendoes, led my father to suspect that I was a libertine, a gamester, and almost a drunkard. This was previous to my mother's death; and when, afterwards, I quit my evil courses, he caused temptation to be placed before me, and I resisted not.
               I loved him; trusted him implicit, and would have fought any who had dared to hint that he was aught else than a honorable man. He introduced me to a young lady by the name of Emma Wycherly, and told me her history, and interested me in her. He said she was friendless; that her mother was an unprincipled woman, had deserted her child, and gone to California with a notorious gambler; that she had taken with her all the money which had been left to Emma by her grandfather, who, although an Irishman, he said, had been an officer under Napoleon, and had come to this country when that hero's sun had set, and brought with him his only remaining child; for the flowers had bloomed and withered many a year on his companion's grave; that she—Emma—was accomplished, well educated, of refined mind, etc., etc. She was indeed a beautiful creature, and possessed powerful attractions: but she was a devil withal, and in league with my cousin. I visited her often, and and took pleasure in her society. We talked, rode, sang together; and I, poor fool, was carried away with her.
               This conduct Richard White—for that was his name—represented to my father, adding that he had no doubt that I had seduced the unprotected innocent; that he had pleaded with me, but that I had spurned him; that he disclosed this circumstance to him—my father—only with the hope that he would induce me to relinquish the unholy desire, etc. My father at first was surprised, and then his surprise was turned to rage against me. Hie never thought to investigate, but prejudged; and, in his virtuous indignation and before the passion had subsided, wrote me the following letter which was placed in my chamber, and which I saw the follow morning.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "CHARLES MOORE:—Once I loved you—thought you were a son to be proud of—that you would prove an honor to your mother and myself; but instead, you have dishonored her memory, and put shame upon our name. I need not mention your crime; your nightly dissipation, your gaming, your libertinism; tell you of you choice associates; or how you won the heart of a young, innocent, unprotected orphan, and robbed her of her honor! Begone from my house! I never will see your face more. I inclose in this a check for all the money you will ever receive from me; and, sir, do not attempt to see me, for I will not hear you. I am childless now.
                           
                              "Once your father; I now am
                              "EDWARD MOORE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               I was amazed—confounded! What could it mean? "Not see me!" Why? "Dishonored my mother's memory!" Had I not, since her death, been most exemplary in my conduct? Some enemy must have set him against me; but I knew of none. He must be mad! I would ask Richard what it could mean. But no, it must be a joke. No; this is his hand, and the check! I'll see no one; if he chooses to throw me upon the world, condemn me unheard, and for no crime, let him. I'll never ask him to do me justice.
               Such were some of the thoughts which crowded upon my brain on that eventful morning; and, from that moment, I took the way that leads to shame and ignominy.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Fear'd, shun'd, belied, ere youth had lost her force,
                           He hated men too much to feel remorse;
                           And thought the vice of wrath a sacred call,
                           To pay the injuries of one on all."
                        
                     
                     BYRON'S CORSAIR.
                  
               
               I left my home, never to enter it again. Shortly after this, my father died suddenly; it was said, in a fit. He had made a will a short time before, and left the bulk of his property to Richard White; and to me, his injured child, a shilling. The balance, save a few small bequests, he gave to different charitable institutions. But of this I was ignorant; for I heard nothing, sought to hear nothing, from the moment I crossed the threshold of my home.
               I hoped to bury all memory of home in oblivion of forgetfulness. When I left the house in which I had seen so many happy hours, I went first to call on Emma, and bid her farewell; for I was determined to turn my back on my native city. She was not at home, but had left a note to be given me, if I should happen to call during her absence. It was an insulting letter, and said, in substance, that she had been advised of my character, and that
                  
                     SECOND MEETING OF CHARLES MOORE AND EMMA WYCHEREY.
                   she would be obliged to decline any further attentions from me. This opened my eyes a little; but still I was in the dark as to who the fiend could be who had stabbed me in the dark. For her I cared little; I had enjoyed her society, been fascinated with her charms; but I loved her not; neither had I thought dishonorably of her. And so it gave me little pain at the thought of never seeing her more.
               That evening, I took the cars for New York, and arrived at that Sodom on the morning of the next day. I still had some money, and sought out means to increase it. I was an adept at all games of cards; and although I never had gambled merely to win, the excitement of the game had induced me to study all the chances and tricks, and become a master-hand at cards.
               In New York, one will not have to travel far to find a gambling "hell,"—and no other -word could so well express the character of such places;—hells! I have seen all the passions that would go to make up Satan in his utmost perfection there displayed. In the countenances of the votaries of the cheating Goddess, you could read the motives which induce all crime, all wrong, all evil.
               For a time I only gained; but one step from virtue lands us on another lower down. I observed, almost every evening, at one of the saloons which I frequented, a singular looking man, who, from some cause, I ever and anon found myself gazing at; and I never became conscious of the impoliteness, but I saw, too, that he was also scrutinizing myself. At last he spoke to me. I replied. We afterwards were mutually attracted; soon became intimates; he told me his history, and I related mine; and, not long after, he spoke of an association to which he was attached, and of which he hoped I might become a member. After sounding me thoroughly, and learning that I had no very virtuous scruples, he disclosed to me that the association of which he had spoken, was composed of artists of various professions, who believed that "the world owed them a living;" and accordingly they lived upon the world.
               To be brief, I became a member of a band of unprincipled villains; and soon I was their peer. I took a devilish pleasure in proposing and performing the most bold and deliberate villainies, and always undetected. One I will mention, and so do away with a wrong impression, which hangs over an innocent man. I heard that a gentleman would soon leave New York for one of the Eastern cities, with a large amount of money in his possession. I had watched him for several days; followed him like a shadow. He was a cautious, shrewd man, and it required all the ingenuity I was master of, to discover a plan by which I could possess myself of his money. He started with the money, carrying only a carpet-bag; had no trunk or other baggage. I thought he had sent the money by express, and had concluded to give up the task; but I noticed that he seemed to grasp the handle of the carpet-bag very nervously, and would often look down at it. Nov, ordinarily, this would not have attracted attention, but the thought struck me, that the money was in that bag. I procured a ticket, started with him, got, by some manœuvering, a seat in the cars beside him, entered into conversation with him, and thus passed over a portion of the route. Fortunately, we had entered the cars so close together, that no one could have known whether he or I carried the carpetbag; and though I had formed no plan before I got into the cars, that circumstance gave the hint to me. Your thorough rogue always carries with him some of the implements of his profession; and I had by me a preparation, which, although deadly poison if taken freely, would only render one gradually insensible if administered in minute portions. A boy came into the cars, at one of the stopping places, with some peaches for sale. I purchased some; and managed to rub a portion of this preparation into a peach, and presented it to my victim. He accepted it, thanked me, and in half an hour was in a fine, sound sleep, while I, at the first stopping place, left the cars with the carpetbag, and returned in express train to New York. I was correct in my conjectures; the bag contained nearly thirty thousand dollars.
               I was elated with this piece of good fortune, and received considerable credit from my associates; but it was deemed a measure of prudence that I should leave the city, for fear that suspicion might attach to me. So, in company with the comrade whose acquaintance I had made in the gaining saloon and whose name I shall call Williams—(for I cannot betray those whom I swore never to injure; my own misdeeds I am willing to confess to the world, but my oath I will keep sacred)—started for Philadelphia, intending to travel through Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh, and thence by the Ohio to Cincinnati and other western cities.
               Nothing of much importance occurred on the route, save a slight affair with a drover, whom we met east of the mountains. Williams represented himself as a wealthy farmer, and purchased twenty head of cattle from him, and paid him cash down. The notes were counterfeit, but so well done as to deceive any but the most experienced judges. These cattle we sold within two days, and thus we made the price of them clear gain.
               The war was now being actively carried on between the United States and Mexico, and large contracts had been given out for various materiel required, in order to properly conduct it. Arrived at Pittsburgh, I gave out that we had the sole contract for furnishing mule shoes for the army. As horses were not so well calculated for draught in Mexico, and mules being much better able to stand the climate, large numbers were employed to transport the munitions and stores. We were believed, and three different firms paid us a bonus for a certain share of our supposed contract. We were satisfied with our part of this arrangement, whether the unfortunate sub-contractors were or not. I believe, however, that they eventually disposed of their shoes; but, I have no doubt, called us swindlers.
               We immediately changed hotels, assumed new disguises, and going down the Ohio a few miles, struck off for some one of the small interior towns, until the noise of our late speculation had somewhat subsided.
               Williams had traveled a great deal at the South, and had collected a number of descriptions of runaway slaves, with the view of turning it to account at some time; and he now proposed to me to go on a slave hunt; representing that he did not, of course, mean to take a slave back to his master for the sake of a petty reward; but to represent himself or me as the owner, and when we had got a sufficient number, sell them to a southern trader. When I now look back upon my past life, it seems unaccountable to me to think how I permitted myself to be engaged in such a career of crime, without a single pang of conscience. It was dead within me; the "still, small voice" was hushed in my heart; smothered by my supposed wrongs; for I considered whatever I committed, as the legitimate result of my father's injustice toward me.
               Williams was the most accomplished penman I ever knew; and, connected with this skill, possessed a wonderfully retentive memory in regard to the different handwritings he had seen. He never forgot a peculiarity of style, and could perfectly imitate a hand that he had not seen for months even. It was a part of his task to sign the numerous counterfeit bills which flooded the country at this tine. This skill and memory was put into practice; and, in a short time, changed Williams and Moore, two chevaliers d'industries, into Col. Wagner, and his friend, Mr. Lasquier, a wealthy Creole, who had just come into possession of one of the largest and most profitable plantations in Louisiana. With letters from their eminent friends and acquaintances—the production of Williams—our wealthy appearance, and the show of money, we were soon in the circle of fashion at Yellow Springs. Here we did a flourishing business, and saw "high life," as it is called. Williams, I mean Col. Wagner, came very near winning the heart and hand of a wealthy southern widow, "fair, fat and forty;?" and, no doubt, would have taken possession of her hand and purse; but, unfortunately, on leaving her presence one evening, and congratulating himself on an easy victory, he heard a voice inquire—
               "How long has that fellow been here?"
               "Who do you mean? Not the gentleman who just passed down stairs certainly. That is Col. Wagner, sir, of Florida."
               
               "Col. ——! Why, that's Jack Williams, the most expert counterfeiter in the country. He's upon some "lay." I must keep an eye on his movements."
               The Colonel did not permit the individual who had expressed an intention to keep an eye on his movements, to got a second look at him; for, meeting me, as I was returning from a ride with two interesting daughters of a distinguished senator of Ohio, he intimated a desire of saying a word in private. As soon as it was prudent, he said—
               "Charley, boy, the hunt's keen; hounds close at hand."
               "What's up, now?"
               "Why, who do you think I saw to-night? Nobody else than J. D——!"
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Would you, when thieves are known abroad,
                           Bring fourth your treasures in the road?
                           Would not the fool abet the stealth,
                           Who rashly thus exposed his wealth?
                           Yet thus you do, where'er you play
                           Among the gentlemen of prey."
                        
                     
                     GAY'S FABLES.
                  
               
               The next sun, when it climbed the mountains, shone upon us as we hastily moved alone, the road which led from the Springs. It was Williams' thought, as it had been my suspicion, that this celebrated officer was upon my track; so we assumed another character, and went to Lisbon, Ohio. A short distance from this place, Williams discovered a negro, who answered one of his descriptions; and on marking some inquiries among the citizens, he made out the necessary papers, took the legal steps usual in such proceedings, and was soon in possession of a fine, powerful young black. The negro tried to prove that Williams had no claim on him; that he had never been his slave; but Williams was an adept at the business, and he had no chance of escape.
               We now struck a course for the river, and on board the steamer on which we took passage, Williams discovered an old acquaintance, who was now a trader, and a bargain was soon made up between them, by which we increased our stock some seven hundred dollars, and transferred all claims upon the negro.
               We did not stop on our way down the Ohio, until we arrived at Cincinnati, where were a portion of the associations, engaged in the manufacture of bogus coin. They had a house on the hill, back of the city, secure from observation, and successfully carried on their operations. Williams took charge of a quantity of this coin, to convey to New York; and left me, at my desire, in Cincinnati, to await his return. I stopped at the Pearl Street House, and once more gave my whole attention to gambling. In all the towns which lie on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, the gamblers are always in full play; and there are great numbers generally congregated at Cincinnati in the fall, in order to start for the capitals of the states of Ohio and Indiana, at the opening of the legislatures of those states. It is notorious that those who should make and cause to be enforced, the most stringent laws against this debasing practice, are its supporters; for gamblers flock to a place where a legislature or court may bold its sittings, as they congregate at a horse-race, sure of support and custom. And this place, too, was the hot-bed of the vice; for there were establishments opened for the tyro as well as the master gamesters. I have seen, and visited them only for curiosity, at a room within half a square of Main street, more than one hundred persons, from the boy of fourteen to the hardened man of sixty, actively engaged at that illusory, vile game called "keeno;" and the very next door was another room filled with men and boys, playing at "rondo," and with perfect impunity, fearless of laws which they know were a dead letter, and never were meant to be enforced, when they were enacted by their politico-gaming legislators.
               Returning home, one night, from a heavy gaming saloon on Fourth street, when passing an alley in the very heart of the city, and in which were enacted dramas every hour, I heard what I thought was a groan. I stopped, listened, and it was repeated. Peering down the dark alley, I discovered a shapeless mass, which seemed to move, and appeared to be the source from which the sounds which had arrested my progress, proceeded. Cautiously I ventured down in the direction of this mass, and on reaching it, found, to my surprise, that it was a human being.
               "For the sake of God, whoever you are, have pity! I am dying from want!" scarcely above a whisper, was brokenly uttered by the poor creature. I raised the sufferer gently in my arms, and bore her—for it was a female—to the nearest lamp, and saw misery enstamped on features I had once thought beautiful, in lines fearfully distinct. I recognized her through the disguise which want, and suffering, and despair will work upon humanity. I forgot the contumely which had been thrown upon me, and my sympathies were warmly aroused. By my orders she was conveyed to the hotel at which I stopped; a room prepared, physician called, nurse engaged, and every attention which her situation demanded, was promptly given. How Emma Wycherly could have become the miserable object of pity I now beheld, was to me a mystery, whose revealing sent to my heart the black spirit of revenge, and transformed me into a human devil. But I anticipate.
               In a few days, Emma was sufficiently improved to recognize me, and tell her sad story. She prayed my forgiveness for the wrong she had done me; that it was not herself, but Richard White had forced her to act thus. She had not long to live; she had endured beyond her strength, and the physician told me that already the seal of death was upon her, that soon she would pass from this scene of earthly woe. As I sat by her bedside, she related to me the history of her life, which I will briefly repeat.
               "I came from Maine, as many other girls do, whose parents are unable to bring them up in idleness, and, in Boston, was recommended to a family on Beacon street, to do plain sewing. While there, I learned whatever accomplishments I may have possessed: music, French, and embroidery; for I was quick to learn, and the young ladies of the family took a pleasure in imparting to me the knowledge they had gained from their professors. Richard White saw me in this, to me, abode of happiness, and won my young heart by the arts of which he was master. Under a solemn promise of marriage, when your father should die—for he induced me to believe that were Mr. Moore to know of our being married, he would leave him a beggar—I fell. His power over me was complete; I could refuse nothing he required me to do and so became instrumental in your ruin. The villain had always seemed to love me till that moment; and when you were forbidden to enter your father's house, Richard White deserted me. I tried to hate him; but could not. I thought him better than he was, and my heart formed many excuses for his conduct toward me. For months I had not seen him; and yet, foolish creature that I was, I had looked for him every day. But it at last seemed as if he would never come, and I determined to go to him. I was afraid to knock, or ring at the door, and ask for him, and contrived to slip into the house unseen. It was at your father's house, and you know how easily any one could pass from room to room, and avoid discovery. Well, after cautiously proceeding until I heard voices in the apartment next to the one in which I was, I listened and recognized the voice of Richard, and heard also another reply to him, which was a strange one to me. It was your father's; and of you they were conversing. He seemed to have repented of his conduct, spoke of you with affection, reproached himself with the severity he had acted toward you. Richard he blamed as the cause; said that, now, too late, he knew how he had acted the villain, and caused him to curse an innocent son; to blast his hopes, and send him to an untimely tomb. It seemed that Richard had caused to be conveyed to him, intelligence of your death, as having occurred in a gaming saloon in New Orleans; and a paragraph had been inserted in a New Orleans paper to that effect, been copied into a Boston paper, and had just been read by your father. Richard was silent; he neither spoke nor moved for a moment; but soon recovered himself, and tried to extenuate his conduct, but without success. Standing on the table near him, were some glasses, and a bottle of wine; one of the glasses was filled, and as your father sat with his face buried in his hands, I saw Richard take a small vial from his pocket and quickly drop some liquid in this glass; and then suddenly saying, 'I leave you, sir; reflection will serve to cast a different color on my efforts in your behalf,' hurriedly left the room.
               "I stood rooted to the spot. It seemed as if some power held me there, to witness the consummation of this deed of horror. As soon as Richard had gone, your father rose and paced the room, saying, 'He spoke truly; reflection does invest his actions with a different hue; the villain! O, how blind have I been!'
               "He seated himself in the chair, near where Richard had stood, a moment, and then, rising, paced the room again; but, horrible to tell! he had 
                     drank
                     drunk
                   the poisoned wine; the glass was empty! The tongue clove to the roof of my mouth; an icy chill of horror crept over me, and drops of clammy sweat rolled down my face and bosom. I turned to leave the room—the house—the city. As I gained the door that opens into the corridor, I met Richard. He started at the sound of my footsteps, saw me, and, from my countenance, guessed I had witnessed his act. He grasped me by the arm, and hurried me into a room, locked the door, and, I have no doubt, would have murdered me, but feared that he might be discovered by my resistance and cries. He swore to me, that unless I would solemnly swear, by my dread of hell. and hope of heaven, never to mention what I had witnessed, that there, on the spot, he would murder me! Weak, terrified, fearful of him, I promised never to betray him. He, from that moment, would never permit me to be an instant from his presence; night and day he was ever watchful of me. Our relative positions now were changed: he feared me, much as I dreaded him. I felt that he would attempt my life, and was continuously watchful of him. He knew, instinctively, that I dreaded him, and played his part accordingly.
               "The next day, Richard missed your father, and sent a servant to his room to wake him. The servant returned, saying that he had not occupied his room that previous night. Where could he be? A search was made. In his study, seated in his chair, with eyes wide open, fixed, staring and lustreless; with purpled face, clenched hands, and a horrid grin upon his fearful, livid countenance, sat your father. Richard swooned with terror at the terrible sight, and was conveyed to his room. The neighbors were summoned, the family physician came, and pronounced it a case of apoplexy. And so it was reported in the papers, that 'the wealthy Mr. Moore, one of the most enterprising of our merchant princes, died very suddenly, on Wednesday evening, of apoplexy. We understand that Mr. Moore, having died childless, his nephew, Mr. Richard White, is the principal heir to his vast wealth.' Yes; he was. But Mr. Richard White had a weight upon his soul, that a million times his murdered uncle's wealth could not have lessened.
               "The funeral obsequies were over. The horses' heads were turned homeward. Richard dared not return to that house. The coachman was directed to drive to the Revere House; and we went there together; for, to avoid scandal, Richard gave out that we had been married some months; but that he had kept the matter secret, on account of his uncle's objection to the match.
               "His mind was in a continual torment of fear and wretchedness, and he thought new scenes would perhaps lessen his tortures; and so we traveled; went to Newport, Saratoga, Niagara, Mackinac, Falls of St. Anthony; came down the Mississippi, and up the Ohio, intending to go as far as Pittsburgh, and cross the mountains to Philadelphia, and from thence to New York. We stopped at various places along the river, at Louisville, Cincinnati, and spent some few days in each. I had watched Richard closely, and had, thus far, seen not the slightest cause for suspicion, and had almost 
                     came
                     come
                   to the conclusion that he deemed me necessary to his existence, to soothe him, calm his fears, allay his irritability; but I was mistaken. He had successfully blinded me, and was soon to have, as he thought, no living witness of his crime.
               "One evening, as we were sailing up the noble Ohio, Richard asked me, as we sat at our state-room door, if I did not wish to go on the upper deck, and see them "wood up." It was quite a picture, he said, to see the dark figures moving about, and the effect of the blazing torches. Not suspecting any evil motive, I acquiesced, and we went up. There were several ladies and gentlemen there before us, and our coming was unnoticed. When the lights in the torches had nearly burned out, they began to descend. The stairs which led to the deck below, were on the extreme side of the boat, and had a railing on the outside, which projected but a few inches. Richard descended before me, in the same manner that the gentleman did who preceded him; offered me his hand to assist me down. When I reached mine, I was half way down. He feigned to stumble, and caught at some thing to save himself from falling. I felt his grasp upon my ancle, and the next moment I was falling through the air, down, down into the dark river beneath. It seemed as if I never would rise up from beneath the waters; but struggling for a moment in fact, but an age as it seemed to me, I rose to the surface; blinded with the waters, nearly strangled, I could not comprehend my situation. Gradually it grew upon my comprehension, and I gave myself up for lost. But, fortunately, I had that evening been trying on a life preserver, and had not taken it off. It was partially filled with air, and that, together with the buoyancy of my dress, prevented me from sinking. How long I remained in the water, I know not; but some men, who had been out engaged in spearing fish, had discovered me floating down with the current, rescued me, and taken me to the house of a farmer on the Kentucky side. In this abode of hospitality—and what Kentuckian's house is not?—I was attacked with a severe fever, and nought but kind nursing rescued me from that grave to which I was so soon to descend. As soon as I was convalescent, I left, came here, and having some money with me, hoped to find some family in which I could be employed, as I had previously been at Boston. I had no desire to follow Richard, or to see him punished; though, God knows, I had cause. I took board in a private family, and sought for employment; but could find none. My money was soon spent, and I changed my boarding place for one less expensive."
               But I will not repeat how, by degrees, she became forced lower down in the hell of poverty and shame, until, on the night I found her, she had been thrust forth to die, from one of those sinks of infamy, which, like foul ulcers, spot the "Queen City."

                           Which make revenge a virtue by reflection,
                           And not an impulse of mere anger; though
                           The law sleeps, justice wakes, and injur'd souls
                           Oft do a public right with private wrong."

                        "Patience!—my soul disdains its stoic maxim,
                        The coward's virtue, and the knave's disguise; 
                        O vengeance! take me all—I'm wholly thine!"
                     
                  
               
               This story aroused in my heart the spirit of revenge; and all the passions of my maddened soul were stung to unrelenting action. O, the villain! Had he been within my reach, I felt as though I could have seized him, and torn him limb from limb, and smiled—laughed at his agony and his cries. And I would
                  
                     MURDER OF RICHARD WHITE BY CHARLES MOORE
                   have that gratification. I knelt, and solemnly swore, that from that moment I would pursue him, even unto the uttermost parts of the earth, until I could see him, grim and stark, lie dead at my feet.
               I left money to secure for Emma the attention she required, and started immediately for New York. Arrived there, I learned that he had left for Europe the previous spring; that he was nearly crazy at the loss of his wife, who had fallen overboard while traveling on the Ohio. It was a pleasure to me to think that no suspicion had been aroused in regard to the death of my father, or the attempted death of Emma; for now I had myself the only proofs of his guilt. It would have been an easy matter for me to have put these proofs in the hands of a police officer, and Richard White would have been hunted, till he was found; would have been brought to the city in which his crime had been committed; been tried, convicted, sentenced, and paid the penalty which man has attached to the crime. But then the law would have been satisfied; society would have been assured of the protection the law; but I, on whom the cursing fell, I would have been unavenged. O, madman that I was! I wanted my revenge!
               I had been so successful of late, in my nefarious transactions, that I had accumulated a large sum, which enabled me to take whatever steps I might choose, to accomplish my desire. I immediately engaged passage on the steamer for Liverpool, which sailed in a few days, and made every arrangement necessary. I will pass over in silence the events of the voyage, as to me they occurred unnoticed; for my mind:was so occupied with the absorbing idea of revenge, that nothing seemed sufficiently interesting to check this passion of thought. In a fortnight we reached the mouth of the Mersey, took a pilot on board, and passed up amid a galaxy of many-colored lights, reflected on the water from Liverpool on the one side, and Birkenhead on the other, which, in any other mood, would have seemed like fairy-land to me. Our guns boomed; mails were taken, and custom-house regulations complied with. We landed. I took the first train for London. It seemed to me that I was impelled by some resistless power, and that to pause would be painful. London reached, had no attraction for me. I saw nothing, heard nothing, thought of nothing around or about me; but a dim something, I could not tell what, seemed to incite me to more speed to reach it. I felt that I was to have my revenge. I knew not how it was to be accomplished; but it was not that; it was a feeling beyond the mere pleasure of the act, which seemed, to my maddened soul, to be such an inestimable prize—a goal of satisfaction, which, once reached, would set me afloat on a sea of rest and contentment.
               It was midnight when we reached Calais; and we went through the formalities of the custom-house, had our passports examined, and then all the passengers of the boat in which I had come from Dover, were free to go where they pleased. I took the cars for Paris at once, and was rapidly rolled along past cottages, tall poplars, windmills, antique looking houses, cultivated fields, till at last we reached Paris. I went, as soon as I had changed my dress, to wait on the American Minister, from whom I learned that Richard White had left Paris only the previous day, for Marseilles. Now, my thoughts assumed a brighter hue, and I moved with step more mercurial than before; and although I saw nothing to attract attention, yet all seemed bright and golden about me. The next day I started for Marseilles. After changing from diligence to cars, cars to steamboats, and vice versa, I at last saw the city of Marseilles, and the blue Mediterranean glittering and rolling beyond. O, what a tumult of raging passion filled my heart, and caused it to beat with rapid pulse within my breast!
               I had allowed may beard to grow without restraint, so that but a small portion of my face was visible; and my early education, and subsequent connection and intimate association with some of the French members of the fraternity, enabled me to converse fluently in the French language; so much so that I was never thought to be other than a native. Besides, Richard had not seen me for some years, and I imagined that time had wrought some change in my appearance, so that I should not be recognized by him until the proper moment should arrive, and so it afterward happened.
               Arrived at Marseilles, I was conducted to the best hotel; and as I was leaving the carriage, I thought I recognized the object of search, in a figure which disappeared behind the pillars of a church opposite. I could scarce resist the impulse to follow, and at once satisfy 
                     mylsef
                     myself
                   and administer to my revenge; but, by a violent effort, I composed myself, and entered the hotel. I was soon in a room, which I had desired should look out upon the entrance to the hotel, and which was situated in one of the most fashionable streets in the city, and, seated at the window, I watched hour after hour, in hope of seeing again the figure which had vanished behind the pillars of the church; but it did not reappear.
               At the dinner-table, I looked at every face which was opposite, and at those I could see near me, and saw him not. The seat beside me, at my right, was vacant; and I merely had noticed the fact, and proceeded with satisfying my appetite, and dwelling on my usual theme, when I was startled by a voice, which I at once recognized as no other than Richard White's. I heard him enter the door behind me, heard his steps approach the part of the table at which I sat, and fearing that my agitation would excite attention, I arose as he was about to seat himself beside me, and left the room. I rushed up to my room in a paroxysm of joy, and paced it rapidly and excitedly. It seemed to me as if I did not touch the floor at all, but skimmed over it, and seemed to fly toward a certain point, which, when reached, would put me in possession of happiness, the philosopher's stone, the oblivion of sorrow or despair. After a time, I grew more thoughtful, began to lay some plan—I had already planned a thousand schemes to punish him, but now the real work was to be done—when I heard some one enter the apartment next the one which I occupied. The thought struck me that it was he. I looked to see if there was any communication between the rooms, but saw none; then the stories I had read of French chateaus and castles, with secret panels and movable walls, occurred to me. Hastily and noiselessly, I examined the wall, and at one point it seemed to me that I could hear the noise made by his moving, more distinctly than elsewhere. Soon I heard him leave his apartment, and descend the stairs; and at once I began to make more thorough examination. The separation between the two rooms was an oak partition, strongly made of large panels, and at the one at which I thought the noise was most distinctly heard, I noticed, upon close examination, that it seemed to be detached from the main body of the partition. I worked at it, until I found how it operated, and discovered that it only required to be raised a trifle, and then it could be moved noiselessly to one side, allowing room for an ordinary sized person to enter or depart with ease. Although overjoyed at this discovery, I made a hasty reconnoisance of the position of the various articles of furniture in the room, so that when the moment should arrive, in which I should execute my direful vengeance, I could accomplish it without noise, or by awkward movements attract attention.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           See—his face is black and full of blood,
                           His eyeballs further out than when he lived,
                           Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;
                           His hair uprear'd; his nostrils stretch'd with struggling;
                           His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd
                           And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdued."
                        
                     
                     SHAKSPEARE.
                  
               
               For several days I could fix upon no plan to accomplish my purpose, which would satisfy me; but, for fear that he might escape me, I determined at once to enter his room, and then let circumstances control the course of action. I never could forget that night: so dark; so solemnly dark, and silent. The sky was overcast; not a single star twinkled through the gloom; all was still, save the storm of passion in my bosom. And now, sleep shook its poppies over the hushed city, and its inhabitants had yielded to its influence, and were loyal subjects of Somnus. The apartment I occupied was in a wing of the building, and but two rooms were upon a floor; so that, save by an accidental passer up the stairs, I was secure from observation; still, I feared almost to think, lest I should be heard. At last the clock struck the hour of midnight; and when the last echo of its iron tongue had died upon my listening ear, I grasped my dagger nervously, and moved toward the treacherous panel. Slowly, slowly I raised it up; cautiously, noiselessly it moved aside, and I peered into the room. A lamp was faintly burning on a stand near the bedside, and on it was his watch, an open book, pens, ink, and paper; and on one side, near the head of the bed, a superbly mounted revolver and bowie knife. I ceased to breathe, in order to catch the faintest sound within the room, but heard naught but the long-drawn breathing which denotes slumber. A panther, creeping on a timid, watchful deer; an Indian, stealing upon his slumbering enemy, could not have moved with greater caution, or less chance of detection. O, how my heart beat with exultation, when I had gained the bedside! With what feelings of hellish joy did I remove his weapons, and gaze upon my foe, my victim, and smile at my former visions of revenge. 'Tis said that conscience will not permit sound sleep to visit the guilty; but he was in a sound slumber. Whether my presence and fixedness of gaze, and the action of my mind, had a mesmeric influence on him or not, I cannot tell, but he soon began to grow more restless; then he muttered, sighed, groaned, talked; and of his crimes, of me, of poison, of Emma; begged of her, for God's sake, not to betray him; but "She, too," he said, "she, too, I murdered! Oh God!—"
               He awoke, gazed at me, and was speechless with horror. O, how eagerly I seized him! It seemed as if I had the strength of a thousands arms, as I grasped him by the throat. I drew him from the bed, whispered to him, between my clenched teeth, his crimes and my determination. The dastard resisted not; he clasped his hands, and moved his ashen lips, as if to implore mercy.
               "Mercy! you ask for mercy? O yes, you shall have it. I give you five minutes to make your peace with your God; but, if you make one movement which I can construe into an alarm, you shall die that instant, and your damned soul descend, without a saving prayer, to the hell you merit!"
               He thought this a boon, but I knew it only increased his torment. He could not pray; could do nothing but contemplated his doom. His lips seemed to move, but no sound escaped them; his eyes were full of terror, and fixed with horror; the sweat of agony rolled down his ashen face, and a gush of tears, forced by fear of death, welled from his eyes. And I smiled as I saw it; could have roared with demoniac laughter, but my devilish caution restrained me. The time had expired, and I told him that now he could utter his last wishes, make his last will! for he was setting out on a journey which led to a place long prepared for him by his maker—Satan! He saw there was no hope, and became, as cowards sometimes do, when cornered, desperate. He sprang at me with a suppressed cry, and struck at me with a dirk, which he had contrived to snatch from the floor where I had dropped it. I received him, warded his blow, and buried his own knife—which I had taken from the stand, when I first entered the room—in his body. It was not a mortal wound, and he strove to return it. As he raised his arm, to give force to the intended blow, quick as lightning, I buried my knife in his side, and the red life-blood gushed in torrents as I withdrew it. I caught him ere he fell, and again sent the stained blade to drink at the fountain of his life. Again I plunged it into the lifeless body, and drew it slowly forth, and smiled, gazed joyfully upon his recumbent figure. I stooped to see if he still lived, and placing my hand upon his breast, could feel no throb of life. The red stream issued from his wounds, and formed itself into a pool about him; the dim light of the lamp cast a gleam of horror over the scene. I could feel the warmth of life give way to the chill of death; I spoke, and he answered not; he was dead! The murderer of my father was dead, and I, his injured son, had done the deed! I felt no joy. A dim feeling of terror, which the presence of the dead impresses on the living, gradually came over me. It grew more and more terrible, and I strove to avert my gaze from the victim of my revenge, but could not. It seemed as if some power held me to the spot; I could not even turn my eyes away from the horrid spectacle. Day began to break. By a violent effort I arose to my feet, and the necessity of escape occurred to me. I hastily turned the key in the door, arranged the articles which had been displaced in the struggle, gathered up the weapons, and hastily left the room. Passed through the panel, I carefully closed it, and hoped to have shut out the scene I had just quitted from my gaze; but in vain! It was more fearfully distinct, more real, more terrible in the mind's eye than the reality.
               Endeavoring to shake off the horrible feeling which hung upon me, I proceeded to remove all traces of the encounter. I washed my hands, face, and cuffs, which were stained with blood, and every spot I could discover, I carefully removed. At last the task was done, and then I proceeded to form my plans to avoid suspicion; but concluded to wait, and let circumstances control my action. The bell rang for breakfast, and composing my features, I descended and partook of the meal with as much apparent unconcern as if nothing had occurred to disturb me. The great nerve necessary to make a successful villain, I possessed. I could present a forged check, with as little tremor and apparent nonchalance, as could Rothschild sign a check for a thousand pounds; or, in a game at cards, ruin a thoughtless youth, and smile at his simplicity and agony. But now, I had a feeling working within, which I had never before experienced; and it seemed to me as if all I met, and each one that chanced to look at me, knew my guilt. I returned to my room immediately after I had broken my fast—but which was only a terrible exertion, for each morsel seemed to choke me, and the chocolate seemed molten lead. I wished to see what steps would be taken when the deed was discovered.
               The minutes seemed years, the hours ages. At last I heard his valet knock at the door of his master's apartment, and receiving no reply, he knocked again. Then he seemed to wait for a moment, and conversed with some of the servants who were passing. The door opened; an exclamation of horror and surprise burst from him, and soon after others entered the room. I immediately left my room, to learn the cause of the cry; but as I gained the door of the fatal room, I saw his servant, with his master's body in his arms, and recognized him. He saw me, and his suspicions were at once aroused. He, too, recognized me; I felt it to be so. By great exertion, I expressed horror at the sight, and inquired how it happened, and some of the commonplace questions which such an event usually suggests, and passed down the stairs. As I turned to go down, I could see into the room, and observed the servant look earnestly at me, and seem to speak excitedly and with energy. He had been a servant to Richard from a boy, and was almost as great a scoundrel as his master; but he was attached to him, and I felt that he would pursue me like a bloodhound.
               As I did not know what moment I should leave the city, I had procured the necessary passports; and ordering my luggage to be sent to Florence, I took a course directly opposite. This threw my pursuers off the scent—for I was immediately suspected and pursued. I hastened again to Paris, and there entered once more into the gambler's life, to drown thought, for excitement to keep out the scene, for it haunted me day and night. For money now I cared not; wine seemed like fire—I could not swallow it. I gamed night and day, and won always. Crowds followed to see my bonne fortune, for I gave away my winnings to those who did not win. I could not stop playing, and every coin I would win seemed to add to my misery. I grew thin, haggard, and spectre-like. I loathed life, and feared to commit suicide. Punished I was, most terribly, for my crime!

                           Comes stealing round him, dim and late,
                           As if it loath'd the sight.
                           Reclining on his straw bed,

                           His bloodless cheek is seam'd and hard,
                           Unshorn his long neglected beard."
                        
                     
                     J. G. WHITTIER.
                  
               
               At last I was hunted out, arrested, conveyed to Marseilles, and imprisoned, tried, convicted, sentenced! I was alone in my cell. I looked up, and my eyes caught the strong iron bars of the little window; and then came over me, for the first time, the full meaning of that word—prison. Aye, I was in prison; and for what? I could not go out or come in at will. I was watched, commanded at every turn—a criminal! one whose hand had deprived a fellow of the life which God gave, and He alone had the right to take; and then the hell of that horrible scene would pass before me. I could now realize the curse which Cain received; the same brand was upon my brow. I, too, was accursed; but my sentence was merciful to his—death! O, how I longed for it, and hoped that that would be the last; but my conscience told me there was another tribunal, another judgment. The lessons of my mother came fresh, and with fearful potency, upon the swift wings of memory, aroused by an awakened conscience. I gazed about me. The smooth, white walls of my cell seemed to move, as if to crush me; closer and closer they seemed to come upon me; and then they would dilate, expand, increase to vast cliffs, mountains of white, and crush me with their vastness! If there had been one speck, a stain, a projection however slight, a cobweb even, to break the monotony, to fleck their unbroken ghastliness! They stared at me, like grim, impassive, featureless, formless fiends; all the more dreadful for their hypocritical cleanliness, purity as of a saint-inquisitor watching, with spotless conscience, the victim on the rack. They choked me; I gasped for breath, stretched out my arms, rolled shrieking on the floor. The narrow, checkered glimpse of the free blue sky, seen through the grated window, seemed to fade dimmer and dimmer, further and further off! I sprang up, as if to follow it, rushed to the bars; shook and wrenched at them with furious exertions; but they
                  
                     CHARLES MOORE CONFINED IN THE GREAT PRISON AT MARSEILLES.
                   stirred not. The sun was going down with golden step, to bathe in the waters of the bright Mediterranean; all seemed azure and gold, brightness, and purity without; but, O God! within, full of rottenness and horror! I grew calmer as the night came on, and the idea of escape entered my mind. Before morning I had formed a plan, and proceeded to put it into execution.
               I managed to secrete the knife which the jailer brought with my food, and had sawn two of the bars of the window asunder that night. The next evening, soon as the hour for retiring had arrived, and the turnkey had made his customary visit, I wrenched the bars until I had nearly bent them sufficient to admit my head and shoulders beneath them. Looking out, I saw that it would require a rope some forty feet long, to reach the roof of a house adjoining, and within a yard of the prison. My bedding soon furnished that; and when the noise of the city had grown still, I fastened my rope to the bars, and commenced my descent. All was silent. It was a bright, starlight night, and it was strange I was not discovered; but I succeeded in gaining the roof of the adjacent house undiscovered. Fortunately, the scuttle was open. I quickly descended and found myself in a sleeping apartment. I succeeded in passing through the room, without alarming the sleepers, and descended to the next floor. Here I bethought me of my dress, which was the prison uniform, and it must be changed, or I could not escape undetected; so, retracing my steps, I reëntered the room, and by the dim light of the night-lamp, secured some garments which were deposited on a chair by the bedside. There were two occupants in the bed, a man and his wife probably; I did not have the curiosity to inquire. Fortunately, the clothes fitted me; and on putting my hands in the pockets, I found a porte monnaie, with a louis d'or and some small silver. This was indeed fortunate. I never stopped to consider whether the action was right or wrong; but, as soon as I had completed my toilet, I left the sleepers to enjoy their slumbers, and have no witnesses to the surprise which awaited them on awaking.
               It would, perhaps, be unnecessary to state, that the dwellings of all large towns and cities in France, are seldom occupied by one family. They are rented in floors, for the first three stories, in gradation, to rank and wealth. On the first floor you may often find a count, or even a duke; on the next above, a wealthy merchant or broker, and, in the higher stories, different degrees of society, until, in the highest, nearest heaven, dwells poverty and misery. The room into which I first entered, however, I afterwards learned, was occupied by a runaway couple, who chose this retreat to pass their honey-moon in, and as a concealment from disappointed and angry relatives. But to return. I had passed down into the second story, and my attention was arrested by a stream of light, which glimmered through a key-hole at the end of a long passage. I approached it cautiously, and stooping, looked into the room. There, upon her knees before a crucifix, I beheld a beautiful woman, lovely as an angel. Her eyes were raised toward the emblem of suffering, beaming with the mildness and benignity of devotion. O, how my heart smote me! alas, I could not pray! A moment, and a shadow obscured my vision; it was gone, and I beheld a figure stealthily approach the devotee. I felt that a wrong was about to be done. Slowly, I turned the handle of the door, and cautiously I moved in the footsteps of the figure. The light was upon the oratory, so that no shadow preceded our steps, and which might have attracted the attention of the fair devotee. Suddenly, the figure having approached sufficiently near, he seized the lady by the hair with one hand, and hastily muttering a few hurried exclamations of fury, raised his arm aloft, and brandishing a huge dagger, prepared to give a fatal blow. Quick as thought I seized his arm, and wresting the weapon from him, plunged it to his heart. He sank to the floor, and expired without a groan. The fair angel, whose life he had attempted, had swooned with alarm and surprise; quickly I took her in my arms, and dashing some cologne upon her face, she partially revived. In a few minutes she had recovered sufficiently to comprehend the termination of the tragedy which had taken place. She turned to me, and with a smile which would have graced an angel, thanked me for my timely interposition; said that the good angel who watched her had surely sent me to her aid; that the blessed Virgin would receive her prayers for me, and bless me for the action; that this man was her uncle, coveted her father's wealth, and on her father's death had tried, by a forged will, to secure it; but that the fraud had been detected, and the unnatural brother tried and convicted, and sentenced to the galleys; whence he must have escaped, and thus, as I had seen, attempted to revenge his own wickedness.
               She stopped. In the presence of virtue and loveliness, I was dumb; I could not utter a sound; I only gazed at her with tumultuous feelings at my heart, which seemed to stop its pulsations. The color deepened in her face, as she saw my fixed gaze, and she turned to leave the apartment. I made a gesture; she stopped. Falling upon my knees, I poured out my whole soul; all my life was spread before her, and my late escape. She seemed to compassionate me, and yet fear me; and no wonder. She hastily put into my hand a purse, and drew from her finger a magnificent diamond, saying,
               "Take these as a return for your noble act, in protecting me; but you must escape; you have no means: these will assist you."
               I hesitated; pointed to her dead enemy. She knew my thoughts, and said
               "Be under no apprehensions on my account; he cannot harm me now. As soon as you are gone, I shall call the servants."
               She did so, before I would leave; and the porter opened for me the gates; and I walked forth into the solitary streets, free, yet more fettered than ever. I wandered about purposeless; all danger seemed to have vanished for a time. The gray tints of the dawn began to streak the horizon, before my mind resumed its normal state; and I was once more awake to the terror of my condition. I stepped into the first barber's shop I could find open, and had my beard and moustache removed, and purchased a wig and spectacles; and, donning then, I looked little like myself. Not even an intimate friend would have recognized me.
               Soon as the current of life began to flow through the streets, I passed out from the city, and went up on the hill back of it, in order to escape observation, and concert some scheme for safety. The quay was lined with vessels of all nations; and gay flags were flying, and the sun glancing on the bright waters; the busy city, with its droning hum; the chimes from neighboring spires; the gayly dressed and vivacious citizens, who, like myself, had come out from the busy town, to breathe the fresh air, and while away the hours. All were dead, as it were, to me. I saw them not; heard not; was insensible to all outward sights and sounds; for my conscience was again looking into the dark mirror of wrong my whole life had helped to form.
               I was startled from this dream, by a tap on the shoulder from a gendarme; and looking around, I saw that he was accompanied by six others, and the servant of Richard White, of whom I have before spoken. He it was who had traced me to Paris, and had caused me to be arrested there; and with fidelity to his master's memory, and for his own gratification, he had watched me ever since. He had seen me descend from the prison; and when I entered the house, he stationed himself at the gate, to secure me, as I passed out. The adventure in the countess' room, and consequent delay, led him to think that I had escaped by the rear entrance to the house, and he hastened to intercept me; and while he was anxiously awaiting me there, I had passed out at the main entrance. When he discovered that I had escaped him, he posted himself at the depot from which the cars started for Paris, in expectation that I would again fly there. Here, too, he was disappointed. In brief, he adopted every method his ingenuity could contrive, to have me rearrested. The police were alarmed, and hunted the city through, searched the vessels in the harbor, inquired of all who they thought might possibly have seen me; but in vain. Some one, who had been upon the hill to scent the morning air, heard a knot of gendarmes talking of my miraculous escape, and informed them that he had noticed an individual on the mountain, "who seemed to have escaped from somewhere, for he looked as gloomy and desperate as a guillotine;" and this playful suggestion was seized upon as probable, and the officers, accompanied by Thomas Whipple, the servant of Richard, went in search of the gloomy individual.

               I was reconveyed to prison heavily ironed, and a sentinel standing day and night before the cell door, and one beneath, outside the wall. There was no hope of escape from this, and now I felt that I indeed must die. The day draws near with lightning speed; and each moment, as it passes beyond me, I feel, bears with it some portion of my life! O, dreadful thought! Believe me, reader, that the criminal's hope is a dreary one, if he is still in the "gall of bitterness," and the "slough of despond." I have tried to pray as my mother taught me, but in vain. I cannot hope to share the bliss her innocent soul enjoys. The good priest, who daily visits me, and urges me to acknowledge my transgressions, and beg forgiveness of offended mercy, tells me that none are without hope, that pardon is free to all; but it seems impossible that I should be forgiven. To-morrow I shall see the day break for the last time; the sun that shall then rise, and illumine my dreary cell with its rays, shall be welcomed by me no more. It will set on my death; its last rays will gild the scaffold, upon which I am to suffer man's punishment and thence go to God's bar for a second judgment. But it is just, though terrible. You who walk the paths of virtue, never be lured by false lights from your way. They may seem worth the chase; but set out to capture them, and they will lead to ruin. I was once honest, pure, innocent! I listened to the tempter, and fell! as all will, who harken to his insidious counsels.
               I have written these lines, impelled by the hope that they may do some good; that some may read and profit by the stern lessons, in the moral of the checkered life I have led. There is no exaggeration in what I have stated. I have suppressed many circumstances which I might have detailed. Enough has been written to show how easy the gradation from virtue to vice; from vice to crime—to the scaffold-to judgment! Farewell!
            
            
               LETTER FROM FATHER ANTOINE.
               Sometimes, in the journey through life, it falls to one's lot to perform the melancholy duty of recording the result of vice and crime; too seldom, however, has this unpleasant task been lightened by the reflection which sincere repentance, in a doomed and sinful mortal, throws upon his last moments. By the request of the unfortunate man, whose checkered life you have read, and, no doubt, profited by the moral of the sad story, I furnish the following brief account of his last hours on earth.
               Of his trial I need not speak, only to say that it was conducted with entire impartiality, and every honorable exertion made to secure the acquittal of the accused. Of his moments in prison, I can but say that his own account of the passage of time, the reflections of conscience, and the remorse of repentance, are far more eloquently depicted, truthfully conveyed, than I could hope to express them. I endeavored, by all the persuasion and eloquence I possessed, to impress upon him the necessity of repentance, and hope of forgiveness in the blood of Jesus. Repentance more truthful and heartfelt, despair more agonizing, I never witnessed. All hope of pardon seemed shut out from him, by the enormity of his guilt; and until, upon the fatal scaffold, the angel of mercy touched the chord of hope, and the sweet smile of consciousness of the compassion of the Saviour lit up his countenance with radiant joy, he seemed to despair of the intercession of the Redeemer with the Father.
               The extraordinary and almost romantic incidents connected with the fatal transaction for which he was now about to suffer the penalty of the law, had caused it to be circulated far and wide; and for several days before, the one appointed for their execution, the neighboring towns and villages poured forth their curious throngs, anxious to witness the completion of the drama which had so greatly excited them.
               
               On the eventful morning, Friday, August 13th, Charles Moore saw the sun rise, and throw his golden beams on the gay city of Marseilles, for the last time. The city was all confusion; noisy crowds were rushing and hurrying to and fro; the troops were early under arms, and gaily marching to merry music to the rendezvous at the great prison. All thought of business was banished for the present; every one seemed to be preparing for some apparently joyful occasion. A stranger would have thought from the bustle and gay conversation and laughter, that the people were met to celebrate the anniversary of some great victory, to receive a conqueror, or express their gratitude for some act of government which tended to their advancement. But no; this "busy note of preparation" was but to satisfy a morbid craving after scenes of horror; a poor, erring, sinful creature was about to pass from the world, by the inexorable hand of justice and law. No conqueror, save death, would greet them; and his chilling, terrible presence, seemed but a joyful occasion, to the light-hearted, fickle populace.
               The brazen tongue, which tells of passing time, now struck its fatal warning on the expectant ear. With slow and solemn step, to the sad music of the dirge for the dead, the 
                     cortége
                     cortège
                   moved on from the gloomy prison to the scaffold. The eager crowds had choked the way, and the cavalry with difficulty forced a path for the mournful procession. Moore sat calm and unruffled in the condemned cart, and listened, with willing ear, to the words of faith and hope, which I, in my poor endeavors, whispered to him. At last, we reached the gloomy instrument of death; with firm step and head erect, Moore ascended the steps; then he whispered me that he hoped for mercy, that he died not without a sign. Extending his hands to those who surrounded him; speaking a few words, pregnant with warning, to the multitude, he surrendered himself to the executioner. A moment, and he was bound to the plank, his neck rested in the groove, the fatal blade descended, and the soul of Charles Moore passed to judgment. The executioner held up the ghastly head, which a moment since was eloquent with life, to the crowd; the body was hastily placed in a basket, the soldiery moved away to a merry, inspiring march, the crowd dispersed, the black guillotine was immediately taken down and removed; and all trace of the drama was soon obliterated, save in the minds of those who had witnessed its terrible consummation. Let all hope that the ends of justice have been answered; that this may serve as a warning, successfully deterring others from the path that leads to shame and ignominy, and that man's punishment may secure God's mercy for the unfortunate!
