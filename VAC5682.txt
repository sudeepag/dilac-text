               Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1858, by SAMUEL P. AVERY,

                  District of New York.
            
         
         
            
               
            
            PREFACE,
            OR PRELIMINARY TUNING OF THE "HARP OF A THOUSAND STRINGS"
            
               A PREFACE!" exclaims the reader. "Certainly—why not? Good acquaintances
               are seldom formed without proper introduction—so a good book is never without a
               preface." "True, but why need a preface when the book is but as the moon, brilliant
               from borrowed light?" "There we join issue. It has lustre of its own. It
               is not the mere jumbling together of jokes, stories, quips, and cranks, that in this
               enlightened, railroad, and electric telegraph-reading age, will enable a book to pass
               muster.
            No, there must be judgment, discretion, liberality, and we may say truly, taste, in
               stringing together the literary, artistic, and jocular lar pearls composing books like the present, so as to
               render the perusal palatable, and something for every palate. Shall we be
               presumptuous enough to say we have done this? If we have succeeded, the knowledge of
               gaining the approbation of our numerous readers, who condescend to peruse these
               "trifles light as air," the consciousness of rising a smile—a laugh—an
                  infectious laugh, in the toilsome journey through life, will
                  well and amply reward us. At any rate, the reader can truly say
               of the compiler, 
                  HE'S SKATERING FOR THE PUBLIC AMUSEMENT.
               
            
            We would fain convert this "Vale of Tears" into the realms of mirth and
               sunny smiles, kill care in a laugh; lighten the heart; sharpen the wits; and set the
               whole world, not by the ears, but in one PERPETUAL BROAD GRIN from
                  (Y)ear to (Y)ear!
            
            We would exhort all unfortunate mortals who lean to melancholy, to
               apply at once to our "HARP" and from its soothing tones they will receive immediate
               relief from the worst attack of the blues, and learn to "Laugh and grow fat."
            In conformity with these good hopes and inclinations, and being, as we ever are, in a
               merry vein, trusting our efforts will not be in vain, we
               have invoked all the choice spirits, not of w(h)ine, but wit, whom we
               have met with—ardent spirits of our own—and prepared A FEAST OF HUMOR
               AND DELICIOUS DROLLERY, to which we invite all and everybody.
            To the banquet, then, dear public. THE BILL OF FARE is before you; take your choice
               of the savory viands so abundantly provided for you. Every delicacy in season graces our festive board; our sheets form an appropriate table-cloth; turn to our pages, and before you take your leaves, dear friends, you will be sure to meet with your deserts—and
               for music—surely among our "THOUSAND STRINGS" one cheerful tune will be
               found to please you.
            Impressed with the force of his own arguments, the purveyor of the present
               entertainment ment, has attempted this epilogue; in which, he trusts he has not
               presumed upon the usual leniency of after-dinner criticism; and that none of his
               readers are of the delightful class of censors, who flourish a flail to demolish a
               cobweb—who indulge in proving, by very elaborate and profound arguments, that there
               is no use in 
                  
                     "Mirth that wrinkled care derides,
                     And Laughter holding both his sides!"
                  
               
                or who occasionally go so far, in fits of ultra fastidiousness, as to cross
               an author's t and dot an i for him.

               "I MAY say to yo, my brethering, that I am not an edecated man, an' I am not one
                  o' them that beleeves edecation is necessary for a gospel pel minister, fur I beleeve the Lord edecates his
                  preachers jest as he wants 'em to be edecated; and although I say it that ought
                  n't to say it, yet in the State of Indianny, whar I live, thar's no man as gits a
                  bigger congregation nor what I gits.
               "Thar may be some here to-day, my brethering, as don't know what persuasion I am
                  uv. Well, I may say to you, my brethering, that I am a Hard-Shell Baptist. Thar's
                  some folks as don't like the Hard-Shell Baptists, but I'd rather hev a hard shell
                  as no shell at all. You see me here to-day, my brethering, dressed up in fine
                  close; you mout think I was proud, but I am not proud, my brethering; and although
                  I've been a preacher uv the gospel for twenty years, and although I'm capting uv
                  that flat-boat that lies at your landing, I'm not proud, my brethering.
               "I'm not gwine ter tell you edzackcly whar my tex may be found:
                  suffice it tu say, it's in the leds of the Bible, and you'll find it somewhar
                  'tween the fust chapter of the book of Generation, and the last chapter of the
                  book of Revolutions, and ef you'll go and sarch the Scripturs, you'll not only
                  find my tex thar, but a great many other texes as will
                  do you good to read; and my tex, when you shill fnd it, you shill find it to read
                  thus: 
                     "'And he played on a harp uv a thousand strings—sperits of just men made
                        perfeck.'
                  
               
               "My tex, brethren, leads me to speak uv sperits. Now thar's a great many kind of
                  sperits in the world—in the fust place, thar's the sperits as som folks call
                  ghosts; then thar's the sperits uv turpentime; and then thar's the
                  sperits as some folks call liquor, and I've got as good artikel uv them kind uv
                  sperits on my flat-boat as ever was fotched down the Mississippi River; but thar's
                  a great many other kind of sperits, for the tex says: 'He played on a harp uv a
                     thou-sand strings—sperits of just men made perfeek.'
               "But I'll tell you the kind of sperits as is ment in the tex: it's
                     fire. That is the kind of sperits as is ment in the tex, my
                  brethering. Now thar's a great many kinds of fire in the world. In the fust place,
                  thar's the common sort uv fire you light a segar or pipe with, and then thar's
                  camfire, fire before you're ready to fall back, and many other kinds uv fire, for
                  the tex ses: 'He played on a harp uv a thou-sand strings—sperits uv
                  just men made perfeck.'
               "But I'll tell you the kind of fire as is ment in the tex, my brethering—it's
                     hell-fire! an' that's the kind of fire as a great many of you'll
                  come to, ef you don't do better nor what you have bin doin'—for 'He played on a
                  harp uv a thou-sand strings—sperits of just men made perfeck.'
               "Now, the different sorts uv fire in the world may be likened unto the different
                  persuasions in the world. In the first place, we have the 'Piscapalions, and they
                  are a high salin' and a highfalutin' set, and they may be likened unto a
                  turkey-buzzard, that flies up into the air, and he goes up and up till he looks no
                  bigger than your finger-nail, and the fust thing you know, he cums down and down,
                  and is a fillin' himself on the karkiss of a dead hoss by the side uv the road—and
                  'He played on a harp uv a thou-sand strings—sperits of just men made
                  perfeck.'
               "And then, thar's the Methodis, and they may be likened unto the squirrel, runnin'
                  up into a tree, for the Methodis believes in gwine on from one degree uv grace to
                  another, and finally on to perfecshun; and the squirrel goes up and up, and he
                  jumps from lim' to lim', and branch to branch, and the fust thing you know, he
                  falls, and down he comes kerflummux; and that's like the Methodis, for they is
                  allers fallin' from Grace ah! And 'He played on a harp of a thou-sand
                  strings—sperits of just men made perfeck.'
               "And then, my brethering, thar's the Baptist, ah! and they hev bin likened unto a
                  possum on a 'simmon tree, and the thunders may roll, and then the earth may quake,
                  but that possum clings there still, ah! And you may shake one foot loose, and the
                  other's thar; and you may shake all feet loose and he laps his tail around the
                  lim', and he clings fur ever—for 'He played on harp of a thou-sand

                        "If you want to make old Satan run,

               TWO T'S—A TALE FOR HOT WEATHER.
               
                  
                  THE "ray of contempt" that "will pierce through the shell of the
                  tortoise," is a shaft from the horn of a new moon in comparison with the beating
                  of an American sun through the top of a stage-coach. This "accommodation," as it
                  is sometimes bitterly called, not being intended to carry outside passengers, has
                  a top as thin as your grandmother's umbrella, black, porous, and cracked; and
                  while intended for a protection from the heat, it just suffices to collect the
                  sun's rays with an incredible power and sultriness, and exclude the air that makes
                  it sufferable to the beasts of the field. Of the nine places inside this "dilly,"
                  the four seats in the corners are so far preferable, that the occupant has the
                  outer side of his body exempt from a perspirative application of human flesh (the
                  thermometer at 100 degrees of Fahrenheit), while of the three middle places of the
                  three seats, the man in the centre of the coach, with no support for his back, yet
                  buried to the chin in men, women, and children, is at the ninth and lowest degree
                  of human suffering. I left Saratoga in such a state of happiness as you might
                  suppose for a gentleman, who, besides fulfilling this latter category, had been
                  previously unhappy in his love.
               I was dressed in a white round-about and trowsers of the same, a straw hat, thread
                  stockings, and pumps, and was so far a blessing to my neighbors that I
                     looked cool. Directly behind me, occupying the middle of the back
                  seat, sat a young woman with a gratis passenger
                  in her lap (who, of course, did not count among the nine) in the shape of a fat
                  and very hot child of three years of age, whom she called John, Jacky, Johnny,
                  Jocket, Jacket, and the other endearing diminutives tives of the namesakes of the
                  great apostle. Like the saint who had been selected for his patron, he was a
                  "voice  crying in the wilderness." This little gentleman was exceedingly
                  unpopular with his two neighbors at the windows, and his incursions upon their
                  legs and shoulders in his occasional forays for fresh air, ended in his being
                  forbidden to look out at either window, and plied largely with gingerbread to
                  content him with the warm lap of his mother. Though I had no eyes in the back of
                  my straw hat, I conceived very well the state in which a compost of soft
                  gingerbread, tears, and perspiration, would soon leave the two unscrupulous hands
                  behind me; and as the jolts of the coach frequently threw me back upon the knees
                  of his mother, I could not consistently complain of the familiar use made of my
                  round-about and shoulders in Master John's constant changes of position. I vowed
                  my jacket to the first river, the moment that I could make sure that the soft
                  gingerbread was exhausted—but I kept my temper.
               How an American Jehu gets his team over ten miles in the hour, through all the
                  variety of sand, ruts, clay-pits, and stump-thickets, is a problem that can only
                  be resolved by riding beside him on the box. In the usual time we arrived at the
                  pretty village of Troy, some thirty miles from Saratoga; and here, having
                  exchanged my bedaubed jacket for a clean one, I freely forgave little Pickle his
                  freedoms, for I hoped never to set eyes on him again during his natural life. I
                  was going eastward by another coach.
               Having eaten a salad for my dinner, and drank a bottle of iced claret, I stepped
                  forth in my "blanched and lavender" jacket to take my place in the other coach,
                  trusting to Providence not to afflict me twice in the same day with the evil I had
                  just escaped, and feeling, on the whole, reconciled to my troubled dividend of
                  eternity. I got up the steps of the coach with as much alacrity as the state of
                  the thermometer would permit, and was about drawing my legs after me upon the
                  forward seat, when a clammy hand caught me unceremoniously by the shirt-collar,
                  and the voice I was just beginning to forget cried out with a chuckle, "Dada!"
               "Madam!" I said, picking off the gingerbread from my shirt as the coach rolled
                  down the street, "I had hoped that your infernal child——"
               
               I stopped in the middle of the sentence, for a pair of large blue eyes were
                  looking wonderingly into mine, and for the first time I observed that the mother
                  of this familiar nuisance was one of the prettiest women I had seen since I had
                  become susceptible to the charms of the Sex.
               "Are you going to Boston, sir?" she inquired with a half timid smile, as if, in
                  that case, she appealed to me for protection on the road.
               "Yes, madam!" I answered, taking little Jocket's pasty hand into mine,
                  affectionately, as I returned her hesitating look; "may I hope for your society so
                  far?"
               My fresh white waistcoat was soon embossed with a dingy yellow, where my
                  enterprising fellow-passenger had thrust his sticky fist into the pockets, and my
                  sham shirt-bosom was reduced incontinently to the complexion of a painter's rag
                  after doing a sunset in gamboge. I saw everything, however, through the blue eyes
                  of his mother, and was soon on such pleasant terms with Master John, that at one
                  of the stopping-places, I inveigled him out of the coach and dropped him
                  accidentally into the horse-trough, contriving to scrub him passably clean before
                  he could recover breath enough for an outcry. I had already thrown the residuum of
                  his gingerbread out of the window, so that his familiarities for the rest of the
                  day were, at least, less adhesive.
               We dropped one or two way passengers at Lebanon, and I was left in the coach with
                  Mrs. Captain and Master John Thompson, in both whose favors I made a progress that
                  (I may as well depone) considerably restored my spirits. If a fly hath but alit on
                  my nose when my self-esteem hath been thus at a discount, I have soothed myself
                  with the fancy that it preferred me—a drowning vanity will so catch at a
                  straw!
               As we bowled along through some of the loveliest scenery of Massachusetts, my
                  companion (now become my charge) let me a little into her history, and at the same
                  time, by those shades of insinuation of which women so instinctively know the
                  uses, gave me perfectly to comprehend that I might as well economize my
                  tenderness. The father of the riotous young gentleman who had made so free with my
                  Valencia waistcoat and linen round-abouts, had the exclusive copyhold of her
                  affections. He had been three years at sea (I think I said before), and she was
                  hastening to show him the pledge of their affections—come into the world since the
                  good brig Dolly made her last clearance from Boston bay.
               I was equally attentive to Mrs. Thompson after this illumination, though I was,
                  perhaps, a shade less enamored of the interesting freedoms of Master John. One's
                  taste for children depends so much upon one's love for their mothers.
               It was twelve o'clock at night when the coach rattled in upon the pavements of
                  Boston. Mrs. Thompson had expressed so much impatience during the last few miles,
                  and seemed to shrink so sensitively from being left to herself in a strange city,
                  that I offered my services till she should find herself in better hands, and, as a
                  briefer way of disposing of her, had bribed the coachman, who was in a hurry with
                  the mail, to turn a little out of his way, and leave her at her husband's
                  hotel.
               We drew up with a prodigious clatter, accordingly, at the Marlborough hotel,
                  where, no coach being expected, the boots and barkeeper were not immediately
                  forthcoming. After a rap "to wake the dead," I set about assisting the impatient
                  driver in getting off the lady's trunks and boxes, and they stood in a large
                  pyramid on the sidewalk when the door was opened. A man in his shirt, three parts
                  asleep, held a flaring candle over his head, and looked through the half-opened
                  door.
               "Is Captain Thompson up?" I asked rather brusquely, irritated at the sour visage
                  of the bar-keeper.
               "Captain Thompson, sir?"
               "Captain Thompson, sir!!" I repeated my words with a voice that sent him three
                  paces back into the hall.
               "No, sir," he said at last, slipping one leg into his trowsers, which had hitherto
                  been under his arm.
               "Then wake him immediately, and tell him Mrs. Thompson is arrived." Here's a
                  husband, thought I, as I heard something between a sob and a complaint issue from
                  the coach-window at the barkeeper's intelligence. To go to bed when he expected
                  his wife and child, and after three years' separation! She might as well have made
                  a parenthesis in her constancy.
               "Have you called the captain?" I asked, as I set Master John upon the steps, and
                  observed the man still standing with the candle in his hand, grinning from ear to
                  ear.
               "No, sir," said the man.
               "No!" I thundered, "and what in the devil's name is the reason?"
               "Boots!" he cried out in reply, "show this gentleman 'forty-one.' Them may wake
                  Captain Thompson as likes! I never hearn of no Mrs.
                  Thompson."
               
               Rejecting an ungenerous suspicion that flashed across my mind, and informing the
                  bar-keeper, en passant, that he was a brute and
                  a donkey, I sprang up the staircase after a boy, and quite out of breath arrived
                  at a long gallery of bachelors' rooms on the fifth floor. The boy pointed to a
                  door at the end of the gallery, and retreated to the banisters, as if to escape
                  the blowing up of a petard.
               Rat-a-tat-tat.
               "Come in!" thundered a voice like a hailing trumpet. I took the lamp from the boy,
                  and opened the door. On a narrow bed well tucked up, lay a most formidable looking
                  individual, with a face glowing with carbuncles, a pair of deep-set eyes, inflamed
                  and fiery, and hair and eyebrows of glaring red, mixed slightly with gray; while
                  outside the bed lay a hairy arm, with a fist like the end of the club of Hercules.
                  His head tied loosely in a black silk handkerchief, and on the light-stand stood a
                  tumbler of brandy-and-water.
               
                  
               
               "What do you want?" he thundered again, as I stepped over the threshold and lifted
                  my hat, struck speechless for a moment with this unexpected apparition.
               "Have I the pleasure," I asked, in a hesitating voice, "to address Captain
                  Thompson?"
               "That's my name."
               "Ah! then, captain, I have the pleasure to inform you that Mrs. Thompson and
                  little John are arrived. They are at the door at this moment."
               A change in the expression of Captain Thompson's face checked my information in
                  the middle, and as I took a step backward, he raised himself on his elbow, and
                  looked at me in a way that did not diminish my embarrassment.
               "I'll tell you what, Mr. Milk-and-water," said he, with an emphasis on every word
                  like the descent of a sledge-hammer; "if you're not out of this room in two
                  seconds with your 'Mrs. Thompson and little John,' I'll slam you through that
                  window, or the devil take me!"
               I reflected as I took another step backward, that if I were thrown down to Mrs.
                  Thompson from a fifth story window, I should not be in a state to render her the
                  assistance she required; and remarking with an ill-feigned gaiety to Captain
                  Thompson that so decided a measure would not be necessary, I backed expeditiously
                  over the threshold. As I was closing his door, I heard the gulp of his
                  brandy-and-water, and the next instant the empty glass whizzed past my retreating
                  head, and was shattered to pieces on the wall behind me.
               I gave the "boots" a cuff for an untimely roar of laughter as I reached the
                  staircase, and descended, very much discomfited and embarrassed to Mrs. Thompson.
                  My delay had thrown that lady into a very moving state of unhappiness. Her tears
                  were glistening in the light of the street lamp, and Master John was pulling away
                  unheeded at her stomacher, and crying as if he would split his diaphragm. What to
                  do? I would have offered to take her to my paternal roof till the mystery could be
                  cleared up—but I had been absent two years, and to arrive at midnight with a woman
                  and young child, and such an improbable story—I did not think my reputation at
                  home would bear me out. The coachman, too, began to swear, and make demonstrations
                  of leaving us in the street, and it was necessary to decide.
               "Shove the baggage inside the coach," I said at last, "and drive on. Don't be
                  unhappy, Mrs. Thompson! Jocket, stop crying, you villain! I'll see that you are
                  comfortably disposed of for the night when the coach stops, madam, and to-morrow
                  I'll try a little reason with Captain Thompson." How the devil can she love such a
                  volcanic specimen! I muttered to myself, dodging instinctively at the bare
                  remembrance of the glass of brandy-and-water.
               
               The coachman made up for lost time, and we rattled over the pavements at a rate
                  that made Jocket's hullabaloo quite inaudible. As we passed the door of my own
                  home, I wondered what would be the impression of my respectable parent, could he
                  see me whisking by, after midnight, with a rejected woman and her progeny upon my
                  hands; but smothering the unworthy doubt that re-arose in my mind, touching the
                  legitimacy of Master John, I inwardly vowed that I would see Mrs. Thompson at all
                  risks fairly out of her imbroglio.
               We pulled up with a noise like the discharge of a load of paving-stones, and I was
                  about saying something both affectionate and consolatory to my weeping charge,
                  when a tall handsome fellow, with a face as brown as a berry, sprang to the
                  coach-door and seized her in his arms. A shower of kisses and tender epithets left
                  me not a moment in doubt. There was another Captain Thompson.
               He had not been able to get rooms at the Marlborough, as he had anticipated when
                  he wrote, and presuming that the mail would come first to the post-office, he had
                  waited for her there.
               As I was passing the Marlborough a week or two afterward, I stopped to inquire
                  about Captain Thompson. I found that he was an old West Indian captain, who had
                  lived there between his cruises for twenty years, more or less, and had generally
                  been supposed a bachelor. He had suddenly gone to sea, the landlord told me,
                  smiling at the same time, as if thereby hung a tale, if he chose to tell it.
               "The fact is," said Boniface, when I pushed him a little on the subject, "he was
                     skeared off."
               "What scared him?" I asked very innocently.
               "A wife and child from some foreign port!" he answered, laughing as if he would
                  burst his waistband, and taking me into the back parlor to tell me the
                  particulars.
            
            
               SUT LOVEGOOD'S YARNS.
               THE STORY OF A SHIRT.
               
                  
                  THE first person I met was "Sut" (after crossing the Hiwassee)
                  "weaving and moving along" in his usual rambling, uncertain gait; his appearance
                  at once satisfied me that something was wrong. He had been sick—whipped in a free
                  fight, or was just outgrowing one of his big drunks. But upon this point I was
                  soon enlightened.
               "Why, Sut, what's wrong now?"
               "Heap's Wrong; durn me skin if I aint most ded. Lite off of that hoss, George, an'
                  take a horn, while I take two (shaking that everlasting flask of his at me), an'
                  plant yerself on that ar log an' I'll tell ye ef I ken, but it's most beyond
                  tellin'. I recken I'm the darndest fool out en Utaw scept my dad, for he acted
                  hoss, an' I haint dun that yet—allers in some trap that cudent kech a sheep. I'll
                  drown myself sum day, see ef I don't, just to stop a family disposition to make
                  d—d fools on themselves."
               "How is it, Sut; have you been beat playing cards, or drinking which is it?"
               "Nara one; that can't be did in these parts; but seein' it's you, George, I'll
                  tell you, but I swar I'm 'shamed—sick—sorry, and—and—mad, I am.
               "Ye know I boards with Bill Carr, at his cabin on the mountain and pays fur sich
                  as I gits when I hev money, an' when I haven't any why he takes one-third outen me
                  in cussin; and she, that's his wife Bets, takes out tother two-thirds with the
                  battlin' stick, and the intrus with her tongue, and the intrust's more'n the
                  princi'l—heap more. She's the cussedest 'oman I ever seed eny how for jaw,
                  breedin', and pride. She can scold a blister onto a bull's face rite on the curl
                  in two minits. She out-breeds ev'rything on the river—and patterns arter ev'ry
                  fashion she hears tell on, from bussels to briches. Oh! she's one on 'em, and
                  sometimes she's two or three. Well, ye see, I got some hum made cotton truck to
                  make a new shirt outen, and coaxed Bets to make it, and about the time it were dun, here comes Lawyer Johnson along and
                  axed for breakfus—I wish it had pizened him, durn his hide, and I wonder it
                  didn't, for she cooks awful mixings when she tries. I'm pizen proof myself
                  (holding up his flask, and peeping through it) or I'd be dead long ago.
               "Well, while he were a eatin' she spied out that his shirt was stiff an' mighty
                  slick; so she never rested till she worm'd it outen him, that a prep'ration of
                  flour did it; and she got a few particulars about the perceedings outen him by
                  'oman's arts—I don't know how she did, it, perhaps he does. Arter he
                  left she set in an' biled a big pot of paste—nigh onto a peck of it, an' soused in
                  my shert an' let it soak awhile, then she tuck it an' ironed it out flat and dry,
                  and sot it up on its aidge agin the cabin, in the sun. Thar it stood as stiff as a
                  dry hoss hide, an' it rattled like a sheet of iron, it did. It were pasted
                  together all  over. When I cum to dinner, nothin' wud do but I must put
                  it on. Well, Bets an' me got the thing open arter some hard work, she pulling at
                  one of the tails and me at the tother, an' I got into it. Durn the everlasting new
                  fangled shert, I say. I felt like I had crawled into an old bee gum an' hit full
                  of pisants; but it were like Lawyer Johnson's and I stud it like a man, and went
                  to work to build Bets a ash hopper. I worked powerful hard and swet like a hoss,
                  and when the shert got wet it quit its hurting.
               "Arter I got dun, I took about four fingers of red-head, and crawled up into the
                  cabin loft to take a snuze.
               "Well, when I waked up I thought I was ded, or had the cholery, for all the joints
                  I could move wer my ankles, wrists, knees—couldn't even move my head, and skasely
                  wink my eyes—the cussed shert was pasted fast onto me all over, from the pint of
                  the tails to the pint of the broadax collar over my years. It sot to me as close
                  us a poor cow dus to her hide in March. I squirmed and strained till I sorter got
                  it broke at the shoulders and elbows, and then I done the durndest foolish thing,
                  ever did in these mountains. I shuffled my britches off, and tore loose from my
                  hide about two inches of the tail all round, in much pain and tribulation. Oh! but
                  it did hurt! Then I took up a plank outen the loft, and hung my legs down through
                  the hole, and nailed the aidge of the front tail to the floor before, and the hind
                  tail I nailed to the plank whot I sot on. I unbuttoned the cooler and risbands,
                  raised my hands above my head, shot up my eyes, said grace, and jumped through to
                  the ground flore."
               Here Sut remarked, sadly:
               "George, I'm a darnder fool than ever dad was, hoss, hornets, an' all. I'll drown
                  myself sum of these days, see ef I don't."
               "Well, go on, Sut; did the shirt come off?"
               I—t-h-i-n-k—it—d-i-d. I hearn a noise sorter like taring a shingle roof off ov a
                  house all at onst, and felt like my bones were all that reached the fore. I
                  staggered to my feet, and took a look at my shert. The nails had all hilt their
                  holt, and thar it were hanging, arms down, inside out, and as stiff as ever. It
                  looked like the map ov Mexico, jist arter one of the first battles—a patch of my
                  hide about the size of a dollar and a half bill here; a bunch of my har about the
                  size of a bird's nest thar; then some more skin; then some paste; then a little
                  more har; then a heap of skin; then more har; then skin, and so on all over that
                  darned new fangled, everlasting, infernal cuss of a shert. It was a picture to
                  look at—an' so was I. The hide, har, and paste, were about ekcally
                  devided atween me and hit. Wonder what Bets, durn her, thort when she cume home
                  and found me missing. Spect she thinks I crawled into a thicket and died of my
                  wounds. It must have skared her good, for I tell you it looked like the skin ov
                  sum wild beast torn off alive, or a bag what had kerried a load ov fresh beef from
                  a shooting match.
               
               "Now, George, if ever I ketch that Lawyer Johnson out I'll shoot him, and if ever
                  an 'oman talks about flat'nin' a shert for me again, durn my everlasting pictur ef
                  I don't flatten her. It's rit-ribution sartin, the biggist kind of a preacher's
                  regular retribution. Do you remember my driving of dad thro' that hornets' nest,
                  and then racing of him inter the kreck?"
               "Yes."
               "Well, this is what comes of it. I'll drown myself some of these days, see ef I
                  don't—ef I don't die from that awful shert. Take a horn, and don't you try a
                  sticky shert as long as you live."
            
            
               HOW SUT LOVEGOOD'S DADDY ACTED HOSS AND WHAT CAME OF IT.
               
                  
                  HOLD that ere hoss down to the yearth." "He's a spredin' his tail to
                  fly now!" "Keep him whar he is." "Woa," "Woa, shavetail." "He's a dancing a
                  jig."
               These and like expressions were addressed to a queer-looking, long-legged,
                  short-bodied small-headed, white-haired, hog-eyed, funny sort of a genius, fresh
                  from some second-hand clothing store, and mounted on "Tarpoke," a nick-tailed,
                  long, poor horse, half-brandy, half-devil, and enveloped all over in a perfect
                  net-work of bridle reins, cruppers, martingales, straps, surcingles, and red
                  feretin, who had reined up in front of Pat Nack's grocery, among a crowd of wild
                  mountaineers, full of fight, and bad whiskey.
               "I say, you darned ash carts, jist keep shirts on, will ye? You never seed a raal
                  hoss till I rid up. Tarpole is jist next to the best hoss that ever shelled
                  nubbins, and he's dead as a still worm, poor old Tickcy-tail."
               "What killed him, Sut?" said an anxious inquirer.
               "Why, nuthin', you tarnal fool; he jist died—died a standin' up, at that. Warn't
                  that good pluck? Froze stiff: no, not that, adzacly. but starved fust, and then
                  froze afterwards, so stiff, that when dad and me pushed him
                  over, he jist stuck out so, (spreading his arms and legs,) like a carpenter's
                  bench, and we waited seventeen days for him to thaw afore we could skin him. Well,
                  thar we was—dad an' me—(counting his fingers,) Dad an' me, Sal an' Jake, (Fool
                  Jake, we used to call him, for short,) an' Phineas, an' Simeon, an' Jonas, an'
                  Charloteean, an' Calline Jane, an' Cashus Henry Clay, an' Noah Dan Webster, an' me
                  an' the twin galls, an' Cathrine Second, an' Cleopatry Antony, an' Jane Lind, an'
                  Tom Bullion, an' the baby, an' the prospect, an' marm herself, all left without
                  any hoss to crap with. That was a nice mess for a 'spectable family to be slashin'
                  about in, warn't it? I be durned if I didn't feel like stealin a hoss sometimes.
                  Well, we waited an' rested, an' waited until well into strawberry time, hopin'
                  some stray hoss mout come along, but dog my cats ef eny sich luck as that ever
                  comes whar dad is, he's so dratted mean, an' lazy, an' ugly, an' savage, an'
                  triflin.
               "Well, one nite, dad he lay awake all nite a snortin' an' a rollin' an' a
                  whisperin' at mam, and next morning' sez he—'Sut, I'll tell you what we'll do;
                  I'll be hoss my self, and pull the plough, while you drive me, and we'll break up
                  corn ground, and then the old quilt (that's marm) and the brats kin plant it or
                  let it alone, jist as they d—n please.' So out we goes to the pawpaw thicket, and
                  peeled a right smart chance of bark, and mam and me made gears for dad, and they
                  become him mightily; then he would have a bridle, so I gits an old umbrella what I
                  found—it's a little forked piece of iron, sorter like unto a pitch-fork, ye
                  know—an' we bent an' twisted it sorten untu a bridle bit, small shape, (dad wanted
                  it kurb, as he said he hadn't worked for sum time, an' might sorter feel his oats
                  an' go to cavortin.) Well, when we got the bridle all fixed on dad, he chomped the
                  bit jist like a rale hoss (he always was a most complicated durned old fool, eny
                  how, and mam always said so, when he warn't about,) then I put on the gears, an'
                  out dad an' me goes to the field, I a leadin' dad by the bridle, and totin the
                  gopher plough on my back. When we come to the fence, I let down a gap an' made dad
                  mad, he wanted to jump the fence on all fours, hoss way. I hitched him on to the
                  gopher, and away we went, dad leaning
                  forward to his pullin' right peart, and we made sharp plowin' dad goin' rite over
                  the bushes and sprouts, same as a rale hoss, the only difference is, he went on
                  two legs.
               "Presently we cum to a sasafac patch, and dad, to keep up his karacter as a hoss,
                  bulged square into it, and tore down a hornets' nest nigh on to as big as a hoss
                  head, and all the tribe kivered him right strate. He rared and kicked once or
                  twice, and fetched a squeal wos nor ary hoss in the district, and sot into runnin'
                  away, jist as natural as ever you seed. I let go the lines, and hollored woa, dad,
                  woa! but you  mout as well of said woa to a locomotive. Ge whillikins,
                  how he run! When he cum to a bush, he'd clear the top of it, gopher and all;
                  p'raps he thort there mout be another settlement ov bald hornets in it, and that
                  it was safer to go over than thrue, and quicker dun; every now and then he'd paw
                  one side of his head with fust one fore leg and then tother, then he'd gin himself
                  an open-handed slap, that sounded like a wagon whip, and running all the time, and
                  karrien that gopher just about as fast and high from the yearth as ever a gopher
                  was carried, I swar. When he cum to the fence he busted right thrue it, taring
                  down nigh on to seven panels, scatterin' and breakin' the rales mightily, and here
                  he left the gopher, geers, single-tree and klevis, all mixed up, not worth a durn.
                  Most ov his shirt stuck on to the splintered end ov a broken rale, and nigh onto a
                  pint ov hornets staid with the shirt, a stinging it all over, the balance on em,
                  about a gallon and a half, kept on with dad. He seemed to run jist adzactly as
                  fast as a hornet could fly, for it war the tightest race I ever did see. Down
                  thrue the grass they all went, the hornets making it look sorter like a smoke all
                  around dad's bald head, and he with nuthin' on but the bridle and nigh onto a yard
                  of plow line a sailin' behind him.
               "I seed now that he was aimin' fur a swimmin' hole, in the kreek, whar the bluff
                  is over twenty-five feet perpendicular to the water, and it's nigh onto ten feet
                  deep. To keep up his karakter as a hoss, when he got to the bluff he jist leaped
                  off, or rather jist kept on runnin'. Kersplunge into the kreek he went; I seed the
                  water fly plum above the bluff from whar I was. Now, rite thar, boys, he overdid
                  the thing, if that war what he was arter, for there's nary hoss ever folded durned
                  fool enough to leap over sich a place; a cussed mule might have dun it but dad
                  warnt acting mule. I krept up to the edge and looked over, there was old dad's
                  bald head, for all the world like a peeled onion, a bobbin' up and down, and the
                  hornets a sailin' and a circlin' round, turkey buzzard fashion, and every once in
                  a while, one and sometimes ten, 'ud make a dip at dad's head. He kept up a right
                  peart dodging under, sumtimes they'd hit him, and sumtimes they'd hit the water,
                  and the water was kivered with drowned hornets. 'What on the yearth are ye doin'
                  thar, dad?' sez I. 'Don't (dip) you see those infernal varmints (dip) after me?'
                  'What,' sez I, 'them are hoss-flies thar: ye ain't really afeard of them, are ye?'
                  'Hoss-flies h—ll!' sez dad; 'they're rale (dip) genuine bald hornets, you (dip)
                  infernal cuss!' 'Well, dad, you'll have to stay thar till nite, an' arter they go
                  to roost, you cum home an' I'll feed you.' And knowing dad's unmodified natur, I
                  broke from them parts and sorter cum to the copper mines. I staid hid out until
                  the next arternoon, when I seed a feller travellin', and sez I, 'What was going on
                  at the cabin this side of the creek when you passed it?' 'Why, nuthin' much, only
                  a man was setting in the door with nary shirt on, and a woman was greasing his
                  back and arms, and his head was about as big as a ten-gallon keg, and he hadn't
                  the first sign of an eye, all smooth.' 'That man is my dad,' sez I. 'Been much
                  fitin' in this neighborhood lately?' sez the traveller rather drily. 'Nun wuth
                  speaking of personally or particularly,' sez I. Now, boys, I haint seen dad since,
                  and would be afraid to meet him in the next ten years. Let's drink."
               And the last we saw of Sut, he was stooping to get into the doggery door, with a
                  mighty mixed crowd at his heels.
            
            
               
               SUT'S EXPERIENCE WITH S-O-D-Y P-O-U-D-E-R-S.
               
                  
                  SUT related the story thus: "George, did you ever see Sicily Burns.
                  Her dad lives at the Ratil Snaik Springs, nigh to the Georgy line!" "Yes, a very
                  handsome girl." "Handsome! that wurd don't kiver the case; it sounds like callin'
                  good whiskey water, when ye ar at Big Spring and the still house ten miles off,
                  an' hit a rainin', and yer flask only half full. She shows amung wimen like a
                  sunflower as compared to dog fennel an smart weed and jimsen. But thar aint no use
                  tryin' to describe her. Couldn't crawl thru a whisky barrel with both heads stove
                  out, if it wur hilt study for her, an good foot holt at that. She weighs just two
                  hundred and twenty-six pounds, an' stands sixteen hands high. She never got in an
                  arm cheer in her life, an' you can lock the top hoop of a churn ur a big dog
                  collar round her waist. I've seed her jump over the top of a split-bottom cheer,
                  an' never show her ankils or catch her dress onto it. She kerried devil enuf about
                  her to fill a four hoss waggin bed, with a skin as white as the inside ov a
                  frogstool, cheeks an' lips as red as a pearche's gills in dogwood blossom time;
                  an' sich a smile! Oh, I be dratted if it is eny use talkin'. That gal cud make me
                  murder old Bishop Soul hissel, or kill mam, not to speak of dad, ef she jist
                  hinted that she wanted sich a thing dun.
               "Well, to tell it at onst, she war a gal all over, from the pint of her toe nails
                  tu the longest har on the hiest knob ov her hed—gal all the time, everywhere—and
                  that ov the excitinist kind. Ov course I leaned up to her as close as I dar tu,
                  an' in spite of long legs, appetite fur whisky, my shurt scrape, and dad's actin'
                  hoss, she sorter leaned tu me, an' I was beginnin' to think I wur jist the
                  greatest and comfortablist man on yearth, not exceptin' Old Buck or Brigham Young,
                  with all his radil cullered, wrinkled wimmin, cradels full of babies, an' his Big

                  kud dance a jig in a kabbage seed, and leave room fur the fiddler.
               "Well, Sicily she bought a tin box ov the sody from him, an' hid it away from her
                  folks, a savin' it for me. I happen to pass next day, ov cours I stopped to enjoy
                  a look at the tempter, an' she wur mighty luvin to me, put wun arm round my neck,
                  an' tother wun whar the circingle goes round a hoss, tuk the 'inturn on me with
                  her left foot,' and gin me a kiss. Says she, 'Sutty, love, I've got somethin' fur
                  ye, a new sensashun'—an' I believed it, for I begun tu feel it already. My toes
                  felt like little minners wur a niblin at 'em—a cold streak run up and down my back
                  like a lizzard with a turkey hen after him in settin' time, my heart felt hot and
                  onsatisfied like, an' then I'd a cut ole Soul's throat, if she'd hinted at
                  needsisity fur sich an operashun. Then she poured ten or twelve blue papers ov the
                  sody inter a big tumbler, and about the same number ov white wuns inter tuther
                  tumbler, an' put ni onto a pint ov water on both ov them, an' stirred 'em both up
                  with a case knife, lookin' as solemn as a ole jackass in a snow storm, when the
                  fodder's all gin out. She hilt wun while she told me to drink tuther. I swallowed
                  it at wun run—tasted salty like, I thot it wur part of the sensashun. But I wur
                  mistaken, all ov the cussed infernal sensashun wur to cum, and it wurn't long at
                  it, hoss, you'd believe me. Then she gin me tother tumbler, and I sent it after
                  the fust, race-hoss fashion.
               "In about wun moment an haf I thot I'd swallered a thrashin machine in full blast,
                  ur a cupple ov bull dogs, and they had set inter fitin. I seed that I wur cotched
                  agin—same family dispersition to make
                  cussed fools ov themselves every chance—so I broke for my hoss. I stole a look
                  back, an thar Sicily lay on her back in the porch, a screemin with laffin, her
                  heels up in the air, a kickin ov em together like she war a tryin tu kick her
                  slippers off. But I had no time tu look then, and thar wur a road of foam frum the
                  hous tu the hoss two foot wide and four inches deep—looked like it had been a
                  snowin—poppin, an a hissen, an a bilin, like a tub ov hot soap suds. I hed
                  gethered a cherry tree limb as I run, an I lit asstraddle ov my hoss, a whippin an
                  a kickin like mad. This, with the scarey noises I made (fur I wur a whislin, an a
                  hissin, an a sputterin, outer mouth, nose an eyes, like a steam engine), sot him a
                  rearin and cavortin like he was skeered out of his senses. Well, he went. The foam
                  rolled, and the ole black hoss flew. He just mizzled—scared ni tu death, and so
                  wur I. So we agreed on the pint ov the greatest distance in the smallest time.
               "I aimed for Doctur Goodman's at the Hiwassee Copper Mines, tu get somethin to
                  stop the exploshun in my inards. I met a sercuit rider on his travels towards a
                  fried chicken an a hat full of ball biskits. As I cum a tarin along he hilt up his
                  hands like he wanted to pray fur me, but as I preferred physic tu prayer, in my
                  pecooliar situwashun  at that time, I jist rolled along. He tuck a skeor
                  as I cum ni on tu him, his faith gin out, an he dodged hoss, saddilbags, an

                  him, and axed him if he'd met any body in a hurry gwine up the road. The poor man

               A HOPELESS PASSION.
               
                  
                  MY young friend Ebenezer Waggles is the victim of a Hopeless
                  Passion. He has a high forehead surmounted with curling hair, through the centre
                  of which a little pathway conducts into the nape of his neck; his eyes are large,
                  and suffused by a tender melancholy; his mouth is formed after the manner of a
                  Cupid's bow, and his chin is sharply pointed and has a hole in its extremity; I
                  don't mention his nose, because it turns up, and rather mars the effect of his
                  other features, but he is upon the whole a very striking looking person indeed.
                  You could scarcely pass him in the street without remarking marking the distraught and 
                     wierdlike
                     weirdlike
                   expression which he is in no way anxious to mitigate.
               He himself admits that he is not of the "common clay," and some of his friends
                  affirm in addition that he is rather of the "mere sham" (or "foam of the sea");
                  whatever affectations he may have, however, they have nothing at all to do with
                  his hopeless passion, for that is a reality which goes nigh to consume him, "he
                  thinks by day, he dreams of it by night;" he soliloquises about it in lonely
                  places, and bores you with it if you sit by him in an omnibus; he woos its object
                  with an unceasing importunity, and expends upon it his time, his talents, and his
                  letter paper.
               And yet it is neither maid nor widow who is the goddess of his idolatry, and far
                  less (for Waggles is the soul of honor) is it any body else's wife; no maid,
                  however coy, no widow, however suspicious, could indeed have held out such a siege
                  so long. The idol of his heart is the Periodical Press, and his hopeless passion
                  is to appear in print! To be in the third column of the supplement on Saturday, to
                  be in yellow letters upon a crimson ground against blank walls for the ensuing
                  week, to be (if such a bliss might only happen!) carried on a placard through the
                  principal thoroughfares—that is the dream of his life, "the mirage (his own words)
                  before his heated eyes in this vast Desert of Existence."
               It was born with him, just as the name of Waggles was born with him.
               I think, although my friend is a religious man, that he would barter his soul for
                  the privilege of seeing a letter of his in print in the Times
                  newspaper. Whenever a grievance arises at home or abroad, or the minutest excuse
                  offers itself for addressing the leading journal, Waggles is one of the first in
                  the field of "Correspondents." Now, although he has done this so constantly as to
                  be enabled to affirm to strangers that he has been writing in the
                     "Blower" for many years," the effect of his arguments (except,
                  perhaps, in their secret influence on the mind of the Editor) has not been great;
                  his communications, in fact, have never been printed; and his connexion with other
                  newspapers has not been less unfortunate. To me also Waggles delights in writing
                  (though he confesses it is not like publishing), and confides in my secresy at all
                  times as in a brother; and I have taken the liberty of making a few extracts from
                  his more confidential letters for the better illustration of his character. Of
                  this newspaper writing, he says:—
               "I have proposed more enigmas for the conservative journal of my native county
                  than the Egyptian Sphynx; when that venal andexclusive print
                  refused to insert them, I sent them, week after week, to the radical organ, in
                  which infidel and revolutionary paper, too, I have always found my initials under
                  the head of 'unsuitable communications,'  not my real initials, of
                  course, but those which seemed to me the most suitable to the occasion: I have
                  written, indeed, under the protection of every letter in the alphabet without the
                  possibility (in the hypothetical case of their being printed even) of anybody
                  being the wiser; but I. 0. U. was always informed that 'metre was not the sole
                  requisite in a poem;' or K. I. S., that there was a 'point where gaiety became
                  indecency;' or D. A. M., that 'blasphemy was not wit;' nor was I more successful
                  with my more ambitious aliases; 'Juvenis' was always recommended to grow older;
                  'Steelpen' to mend himself, and 'Paterfamilias' (for, in despair, I tried that
                  once) to stick to his home affairs and leave off writing rubbish."
               But Waggles seemed never to be in anywise cast down by these disappointments, and
                  did not think it at all out of the pale of chance that he might yet have been made
                  one of "Our own Correspondents" in Utah, with the Commander-in-Chief under one
                  thumb, and the Medical and Commissariat Staffs under the other. Nor did he
                     confine himself at all to the
                  newspaper press, nor to any one branch in particular of general literature; he
                  would have engaged to supply an article for a comic almanac, and another for "the
                  Ecclesiologist" on the same afternoon; he has had one, scores of times, I will
                  answer for him, ready for each, but they, unhappily, were not so well prepared on
                  their parts for it. "From my earliest youth," he confesses, "my
                  delicately-stringed organization has thrilled and quivered in contact with the
                  roughness and brutality of the conductors of the periodical press; such a metaphor
                  as that, sir, even with a supplementary reference to 'harmony' and 'silver,' has
                  been remarked upon by those men disparagingly, or not remarked upon at all, while
                  the rhythmical utterance of the poetry of my impassioned spirit has been
                  designated on one occasion as 'Twaddle.'"
               He is unfortunate, it appears, as regards his literary schemes even in his
                  domestic relations: "My family are almost Calvinistic (he writes in one of his
                  early letters); they congratulated themselves, I believe, that I was born with a
                     caul; they prohibit my receiving numerous rejected contributions
                  upon the Sabbath day; their own periodical literature is of a sombre, not to say
                  sulphureous, description. 'A Live Coal from the Nether Pit,' a tract of not only
                  European, but African celebrity, was thrown off, after dinner, by my 
                     matenal
                     maternal
                   uncle; his connexion with the 'Weekly Scourge for Sinners,' has been of
                  no service to me as an introduction to that journal. A rather amusing contribution
                  of mine was returned but lately by its sub-editor, with marginal request, written
                  in red ink, that 'I should take care of my precious soul.'"
               From almost his infancy, indeed, a desire to inscribe his name upon the scrolls of
                  fame, was "ready laid" (as the housemaids say) within. His breast needed only the
                  slightest spark to set it alight. His own mother appears to have been the
                  unwitting incendiary destined to lay his heart in ruins.
               "About the time," he says, "of my entrance into my eleventh year, I wrote a
                  five-act tragedy upon the Landing of Hengist and Horsa; my dear mother placed it
                  upon a level with the historical plays of Shakspeare; my father conceived that
                  there was 'not enough of the religious element,' in either author. 'Hengist and
                  Horsa' is, as yet, unpublished; the situations are fine, and the characters in
                  accordance with the period; I have not fettered myself with actual facts, but the
                  noble brothers are made to expire simultaneously, after an eating match for the
                  sovereignty, in presence of their assembled nobles. On my twelfth birth-day I
                  completed an epic poem in seventy-two cantos, upon the same absorbing topic, and
                  subsequently composed two essays, one upon the character of Prince Hengist, and
                  the other upon that of Prince Horsa." And again, with relation to his mother he
                  says, "she was the confidante of the never-to-be-printed sonnet, and the rejected
                  elegy, and the unreturned (even) five-act drama; she sympathised with me in all my
                  misfortunes, and was, and is, the only human being who ever believed in
                     me."
               Ebenezer believed, and believes in himself, however, in a very remarkable degree,
                  and always attributes his failures to the jealousy, malignity, or dishonesty of
                  the world in general, and of editors in particular.
               "I am sure that my concise little elucidation (in fifteen verses) of the
                  etymological conundrum of the 'Country Beehive,' should have gained me the first
                  prize of fifty copies; instead of which it was awarded to 'our clever young
                  correspondent B.;" it was awarded perhaps, and not presented; I have my doubts
                  about the personal existence of that genius; and whether anything was given 'to B
                  or not to B.' (as Shakespeare observes), 'that is the question.' Again, in the
                  case of acrostics, I am certain that what ingenuity can have done for
                  acrostics, mine has done, and yet I don't find our periodicals craving after my
                  acrostics: I have written, too, 'Jesuitical Letters' of the most interesting
                  description, to be read four ways, along and across and backwards and forwards,
                  with a different and (almost) obvious sense to each. Loyola himself might have
                  been proud of them, but the editor of the 'Cottage Sun-Dial' is nothing of the
                  sort; he says he doesn't understand any of the four meanings; but I
                  have my own reasons for suspecting that his connexion with the Romanising party in
                  this country, sir, forbids him from publishing such exposures of the arts of the
                  enemies of our Protestant faith. I have, however, I trust, by this time been
                  avenged. The 'Cottage Sun-Dial' requests that the medical experience of its
                  suffering readers may be kindly communicated, and I have at last succeeded in
                  getting the following 'cure for cold in the head' into its columns. It is the most
                  imaginative thing I ever composed, and I devoutly hope it may be tried by the
                  Editor himself. 'Hire a small cane-bottomed chair and set a camphene lamp alight
                  beneath it; undress, and cause wet sheets to loosely hang from your neck, and
                  fall, when you have sat down, outside the chair: as there is some little
                  inconvenience felt for the first few minutes, it is better that the patient should
                  be secured to the woodwork, and the woodwork to the lamp; the attendant may then
                  leave the room for a quarter of an hour, which will be amply sufficient time for
                  the production of the desired effect. 'Signed ATE.'
               'N.B.—I have never known a second application to be required.'"
               
               The sombre life of my persevering young friend has not, however, been unchequered
                  with some gleams of passing joy: some years ago Ebenezer Waggles was as near
                  attaining the object of his fondest wishes as any mortal in this ineffectual world
                  may be; the golden opportunity, it will be seen, was only lost through his own
                  indiscretion and impatience.
               "I was one and twenty years of age," he says, in one of his numerous
                  autobiographical letters, "when the great event of my existence (very nearly) came
                  to pass. The Editor of 'The People's Soap-dish,' a journal devoted to the Dignity
                  of Labor and the Empire of the Spade (for which vide Prospectus),
                     accepted one of my contributions; it was rather a thrilling tale
                  of wrong and retribution; 'The Lord and the Laborer' was no ordinary story of
                  everyday life, believe me; the Peer was insolent, ignorant, debauched, and
                  bloodthirsty; the Peasant, made Lord Chief Justice, had reason to congratulate
                  himself and society, when he passed sentence of death upon that hereditary
                  ruffian! 'Libertas' (that is, myself) was informed that the 'Lord and the Laborer'
                  was in type; was I not justified then upon its non-appearance in the next number,
                  in writing an abusive communication to the Editor? But was he, I would ask you, on
                  the other hand, justified in returning the MS. with 'Libertas is a fool,' written
                  outside it? And yet that was exactly what he did."
               This blow had a very severe effect upon Waggles for some time, and caused his
                  imagination, partly through the sorrow which is most fitly poured forth in song,
                  and partly because he thought it would be more likely to succeed than in prose, to
                  take a poetic course; he was not however, more successful in this respect, for
                  after a little time I find in one of his letters a quotation of some fifty blank
                  verse lines, "extracted," he writes, "from an Epic Poem, entitled 'Never,'
                  forwarded some weeks ago to the 'Weekly Coronal,' and, need I say,
                     rejected?"
               Since I have known this victim of a Hopeless Passion he cannot have spent less
                  than twenty pounds in postage-stamps and four times as much in writing
                  paper—foolscap (he is immensely careful, poor fellow! about blots and erasures,
                  and fastens all his sheets together with a red silk riband): I have counted in
                  that huge escritoire of his as many as forty-eight pretty voluminous MSS.; "This,"
                  said he, alluding to the 'Family Hodge Podge,' for which he was just then engaged
                  in compilation, "this journal is the nine and fortieth in which my young soul has
                  yearned to expand myself and failed; if this too be not accepted, I leave the
                  whole periodical press to their receipts and recipes for ever."
               Since that distressing circumstance took place, however, Waggles has been as
                  constant a contributor to everything as before; it was only a few days back that
                  he came to me with heightened color and his melancholy eyes lit up with joy to
                  tell me of his having broken ground in a new quarter.
               "But it's a secret," he said, "a great secret, and I believe it may be death, aye,
                  and death by burning to reveal it."
               "I tell you what it is, Waggles," said I, "you'll write in one magazine yet,
                  before you die, if you go on talking in this way; and that will be the Hanwell
                  Intelligencer, or Bedlam Monthly Regenerator. What do you mean?"
               "Why, I mean," replied Ebenezer, in a low whisper, and looking suspiciously around
                  him, "that I have written a story entitled 'The Screw, the Lever, and the Plumb
                  Rule,' and I have sent it to the 'Freemason's Weekly Journal.'"
               "But you're not a Freemason, Waggles?"
               
                  
               
               "No," said he, "that is the only difficulty, but I have sealed it with a pair of
                  compasses, and I have signed it 'Brother Smith.'"
               And if my young friend is not the victim of a Hopeless Passion I don't know who
                  is.
            
            
               
               WHAT COMES OF CHAWIN TERBACKER.
               
                  
                  DON'T you know the Stallinses that lives on the plantation in the
                  summer and goes to town in the winter? Well, Miss Mary Stallins, who you know is
                  the darlinest gal in the county, come home tother day to see her folks. You know
                  she's been to the Female College, down to Macon, for most a year now. Before she
                  went, she used to be jest as plain as a old shoe, and used to go fishin and
                  huckleberryin with us, with nothin but a calico sun-bonnet on, and was the wildest
                  thing you ever saw. Well, I always used to have a sort of a sneakin notion of Mary
                  Stallins, and so when she come, I brushed up, and was termined to have a rite
                  serious talk with her bout old matters, not knowin but she mought be captivated by
                  some of them Macon fellers.
               So, sure enough, off I started, unbeknowin to anybody, and rode rite over to the
                  plantation—(you know ours is rite jinin the widder Stallinses). Well, when I got
                  thar, I felt a little sort o' sheepish; but I soon got over that, when Miss
                  Carline said (but she didn't mean me to hear), "There, Pinny (that's Miss Mary's
                  nick-name, you know), there's your bo come."
               Miss Mary looked mighty sort o' redish when I shuck her hand and told her howdy;
                  and she made a sort of stoop over and a dodge back, like the little gals does to
                  the school-marm, and said, "Good evening, Mr. Jones" (she used always to call me
                  jest Joe).
               "Take a chair, Joseph," said Miss Carline; and we sot down in the parlor, and I
                  began talkin to Miss Mary bout Macon, and the long ride she had, and the bad
                  roads, and the monstrous hot weather, and the like.
               She didn't say much, but was in a mighty good humor and laughed a heap. I told her
                  I never seed sich a change in anybody. Nor I never did. Why, she didn't look like
                  the same gal—good gracious! she looked so nice and trim—jest like some of them
                  pictures what they have in Mr. Graham's Magazine—with her hair all komed down
                  longside of her face, as slick and shiny as a mahogany burow. When she laugh'd she
                  didn't open her mouth like she used to; and she set up straight and still in her
                  chair, and looked so different, but so monstrous pretty! I axed her a heap of
                  questions, bout how she liked Macon, and the Female College, and so forth; and she
                  told me a heap bout 'em. But old Miss Stallins and Miss Carline and Miss Kesiah,
                  and all of 'em, kep all tha time interruptin us, axin bout mother—if she was well,
                  and if she was gwine to the Spring church next Sunday, and what luck she had with
                  her soap, and all such stuff—and I do believe I told the old woman more'n twenty
                  times that mother's old turkey-hen was settin on fourteen eggs.
               
                  
               
               Well, I wasn't to be backed out that a-way—so I kept it a going the best I could,
                  til bimeby old Miss Stallins let her knitin fall three or thur times, and then
                  began to nod and snap back like a fishin-pole that was all the time gitin bites. I seed the gals
                  looking at oneanother and pinchin oneanother's elbows, and Miss Mary said she
                  wondered what time it was, and said the College discipline, or something like
                  that, didn't low late hours. I seed how the game was gwine—but howsumever, I kep
                  talkin to her like a cotton gin in packin time, as hard as I could clip it, til
                  bimeby the old lady went to bed, and arter a bit the gals all cleared, and left
                  Miss Mary to herself. That was jest the thing I wanted.
               Well, she sot on one side of the fire-place, and I sot on tother, so I could spit
                  on the hath, whar ther was nothin but a lighterd chunk burnin to give light. Well,
                  we talled and talked, and I know you would like to hear all we talked about, but
                  that would be too long. When I'm very interested in anything, or get bother'd
                  about anything, I can't help chawin a heap o' tobacker, and then I spits
                  uncontionable, specially if I'm talkin. Well, we sot there and talked, and the way
                  I spit, was larmen to the crickets! I axed her if she had any bos down to
                  Macon.
               "Oh, yes," she said, and then she went on and named over Matthew Mattix, Nat.
                  Filosofy, Al. Geber, Retric Stronomy, and a whole heap of fellows that she'd been
                  keepin company with most all her time.
               "Well," ses I, "I spose they're mazin poplar with you, aint they, Miss Mary?" for
                  I felt mighty oneasy, and began to spit a great deal worse.
               "Yes," ses she, "they're the most interestin companions I ever had, and I am
                  anxious to resume their pleasant 
                     sciety
                     society
                  ."
               I tell you what, that sort o' stumped me, and I spit rite slap on the chunk and
                  made it "flicker and flare" like the mischief; it was a good thing it did, for I
                  blushed as blue as a Ginny squash.
               I turned my tobacker round in my mouth, and spit two or three 'times, and the old
                  chunk kept up a most bominable fryin.
               "Then I spose you are gwine to forget old acquaintances," ses I, "sense you's been
                  to Macon, mong them lawyers and doctors; is you, Miss Mary? You thinks more of
                  them than you does of anybody else, I spose."
               "Oh," ses she, "I'm devoted to them—I think of them day and night!"
               That was too much—it shot me right up, and I sot as still as could be
                  for more'n than a minute. I never felt so warm behind the ears afore in all my
                  life. Thunder! how my blood did bile up all over me, and I felt like I could knock
                  Matthew Mattix into a grease-spot it he'd only been thar. Miss Mary sot with her
                  handkerchief up to her face and I looked rite into the fire-place. The blue blazes
                  was runnin round over the old chunk, ketchin hold here and lettin go thar,
                  sometimes gwine most out, and then blazin up a little—I couldn't speak—I was makin
                  up my mind for tellin her the siteation of my heart—I was jest gwine to tell her
                  my feelins, but my mouth was full of tobacker, so I had to spit, and slap it went,
                  right on the lightwood chunk, and out it went, spang!
               I sware, I never did feel so in all my born days. I didn't know what to do.
               "My Lord, Miss Mary," sez I, "I didn't go to do it—jest tell me the way to the
                  kitchen, and I'll go and git a light."
               But she never said nothin' so I sot down agin, thinkin' she'd gone to get one
                  herself, for it was pitch dark, and I couldn't see my hand afore my face.
               Well, I sot thar and ruminated, and waited a long time, but she didn't come, so I
                  began to think maybe she wasn't gone. I couldn't hear nothin' nor I couldn't see
                  nothin'; so bimeby sez I very low, for I didn't want to wake up the family—ses
                  I—
               "Miss Mary! Miss Mary!" but nobody answered.
               Thinks I, what's to be done? I tried agin.
               "Miss Mary! Miss Mary!" ses I; but it was no use.
               Then I heard the gals snickerin' and laughin' in the next room, and I begun to see
                  how it was; Miss Mary was gone and left me thar alone.
               "Whar's my hat?" ses I, pretty loud, so somebody might tell me; but they only
                  laughed worse.
               I begun to feel about the room, and the fust thing I new, spang! goes my head,
                  rite agin the edge of a dore that was standin' open.
               The fire flew, and I couldn't help but swar a little—"d——n the dore," ses I,
                  "whar's my hat?" But nobody said nothin', so I begun to think it was best to get
                  out the best way I could, and never mind my hat. Well, I got through the parlor
                  dore after rakin' my shins three or four times agin the chairs, and was feelin'
                  along through the entry for the frunt dore; but somehow I was so flustrated that I
                  tuck the rong way, and bimeby kerslash I went, rite over old Miss Stallinses
                  spinnin-wheel, onto the floor! I hurt myself a good deal; but that didn't make me
                  half so mad as to hear them confounded gals a gigglin' and laughin' at me.
               "Oh!" said one of 'em, (it was Miss Kesiah, for I knowed her voice,) "there goes
                  mother's wheel! my Lord!"
               
               I tried to set the cussed thing up, but it seemed to have mor'n twenty legs, and
                  wouldn't stand up no how—maybe it was broke. I went out of the dore, but I hadn't
                  more'n got down the steps, when bow! wow! wow! comes four or five infurnal grate
                  big coon-dogs, rite at me. "Git out! git out! hellow, Cato! call off your dogs!'
                  ses I, as loud as I could. But Cato was sound asleep, and if I hadn't a run back
                  into the hall, and got out of the front way as quick as I could, them devils would
                  o' chawed my bones for true.
               When I got to my horse, I felt like a feller jest out of a hornets' nest; and I
                  recken I went home a little of the quickest. Next mornin' old Miss Stallins sent
                  my hat by a little nigger; but I hait seed Mary Stallins sense—now yer see what
                  'comes of chawin terbacker.
            
            
               GETTING "FITS" IN A CLOTHING STORE.
               
                  
                  CUMTOWN, Me., is a place, it is! You can't exactly find it on the
                  map, for it has been located and incorporated since Mitchell's latest, but it's
                     there—a manufacturing city, as large, as life, with banks,
                  barbers' shops, newspapers, and all the usual fixtures and appurtenances of a
                  locomotive, go-ahead, Yankee settlement.
               Just about the newest thing in the new city, is a new cheap clothing store, that
                  'riz up' or 'rained down,' lately, on the Jonah's gourd or Aladdin's palace
                  principle, and which, by the same mysterious dispensation, became endowed with a
                  couple of the cutest Yankee salesmen that the Dirigo State ever turned out.
                  T'other day, an up-river young 'un, who is about to forsake his father and mother
                  and cleave unto Nancy Ann, came down to get his wedding suit, and was, of course,
                  'jist naterelly baound' to find his way into the new clothing store. Not that he
                  sauntered in with the easy swagger of the town-bred searcher after cheap clothing,
                  for the vernal tint was tolerably fresh on him yet, and he stopped to give a
                  modest rap at the door. He had effected an entrance at the grist-mill and at the
                     Journal office where he had been doing business in the same
                  unobtrusive manner, and the boys all agreed that Mr. Nehemiah Newbegin was from
                  'the Gulley,' and was paying his virgin visit to 'Pekin.'
               Nehemiah was let in 'imejitly,' and he was delighted at the cordial reception he
                  met with.
               The proprietors were ready to 'forward his suit' at once, if he 'saw fit,' or they
                  would 'take measures' and 'furnish him to order,' Nehemiah took a handbill from
                  the top of his hat, and spread it upon his knee for easy reference. It was headed
                  in fat Gothic letters:— 
                  
                     "WINTER CLOTHING AT COST!"
                   And set forth that, in consequence of the mildness of the season, over five
                  hundred thousand dollars worth of ready-made clothing was to be closed up and sold
                  out at 
                     "Enormous Sacrifice!"
                  
               
               A list of prices followed, and Nehemiah, running his stumpy fingers down the
                  column, lit with emphasis on a particular item.
               "Say!—v' ye got enny of these blew cotes left, at five dollars 'nd five n'af 'nd
                  six dollars—got any on 'em left?"
               "Smith, are there any of those cheap coats left?' enquired the 'perlite' Mark of
                  his partner. "We sold the last this morning, did we not?"
               
               Smith understood the cheap clothing business, and answered promptly, "All gone,
                  sir!"
               "Jest's I'xpected," murmured the disappointed candidate, "darnation seize 't all!
                  I told dad they'd be all gone!"
               "We have a very superior article for ten dollars."
               "Scacely, Squar, scacely!—ten dollars is an all fired price for a cote!"
               "We can make you one to order."
               "Y-e-s! but I want it now—want it right strut off—fact is, Squar, I must hev
                  'un."
               "You'd find those cheap coats at ten dollars."
               "Dun know about it! Say, v'ye got enny of these dewrable doeskin trowses left, at
                  tew dollars; sold them all tew, spect, haint ye?—haint none o' them left nuther,
                  hev ye?"
               Luckily there was a few left, and Nehemiah was advised to secure a pair at once.
                  Nehemiah was open for a trade, but acting up the instincts of the Newbegins, it
                  must be a dicker.
               "Dew yeou ever tek projeuce for your clothing?"
               "Take what?"
               "Projeuce—garden sass and sich—don't dew it, dew yeou?"
               "Well, occasionally we do; what have you to sell?"
               "Oh, 'most enny thin'; a leetle of everything, from marrowfat peas down to rye
                  straw; got some new cider, some high-top sweetings; got some of the all-killin'est
                  dried punkin yeou ever sot eyes on; spect, neow, you'd like some of that dried
                  punkin."
               Mark declined negotiating for that 'dried punkin,' but inquired if he had any good
                  butter.
               "G-o-o-d butter! naow, Squar, I expect I've got some of the nicest and yallerest
                  yeou ever sot eyes on; got some out here naow; got some in a shoogar box, eout in
                  dad's waggin; bro't it doawn for Kurnul Waldron, but yeou ken have it; I'll bring
                  it right strut in here, darned ef I doan't!' and with all the impetuosity of
                  youth, Nehemiah shot forth to 'dad's waggin,' and brought in the butter.
               On the strength of the butter, a dicker was speedily contracted, by which Nehemiah
                  was to be put in immediate and absolute possession of a coat, vest and pantaloons,
                  all of good material and fit.
               "Now, then," said Mark, "what kind of a coat will you have?"
               "I reckon I'll hev a blew 'un, Squar."
               "Yes, but what kind—a dress coat?"
               "Certainly, Squar, certainly, jest what I want a cote for tew dress in."
               "Ah, exactly: well, just look at those plates," pointing to the fashion plates in
                  the window, "and see what style you fancy."
               "Oh, darn yeour plates, daon't want any crockery; spect Nance has got the
                  all-killin'est lot of arthen ware yeou ever sot eyes on!"
               "Yes, I see; well, just step this way, then, and I think I can accommodate
                  you."
               Nehemiah speedily selected a nice blue coat, and vest of green, but he was more
                  fastidious in his choice of pants, those crowning glories of his new suit. He
                  seemed to indulge a weakness for long pantaloons, and complained that his last
                  pair troubled him exceedingly, or, as he expressed it, "blamedly," by hitching up
                  over his boots, and wrinkling about the knees. Nehemiah delved away impetuously
                  amidst a stack of two or three hundred pairs, and finally his eyes rested on a
                  pair of lengthy ones, real blazers, and with wide, yellow stripes running each
                  way. Nehemiah snaked them out in a twinkling. He liked them—they were long and
                  yellow—they were just the thing, and he proceeded at once to try them on. The new
                  clothing store had a nook curtained off for this purpose, and Nehemiah was
                  speedily closeted therein.
               The pants had straps, and the straps were buttoned. Now Nehemiah had
                     seen straps before, but the art of managing them was a mystery,
                  and like Sir Patrick's dilemma, "required a mighty dale of nice consideration." On
                  deliberation, he decided that the boots must go first; he accordingly drew on his
                  Bluchers, mounted a chair, elevated the pants at a proper angle, and endeavored to
                  coax the legs into them. He had a time of it. His boots were none of the smallest,
                  and the pants, though long, were none of the widest; the chair, too, was rickety,
                  and bothered him, but bending his energies to the task, he succeeded in inducing
                  one leg into the "pesky things." He was straddled like the Colossus of Rhodes, and
                  just in the act of raising the other foot, when a whispering and giggling, in his
                  immediate vicinity, made him alive to the appalling fact that nothing but a thin
                  curtain of chintz separated him from twenty or thirty of the wickedest girls that
                  were ever caged in one shop! Nehemiah was a bashful youth, and would have made a
                  circumbendibus of a mile, any day, rather than meet those girls, even had he been
                  in full dress; as it was, his mouth was ajar at the bare possibility of making his
                  appearance among them in his present 
                     dishabille
                     deshabille
                  . What if there was a hole in the curtain! What if it should fall! It
                  wouldn't bear thinking of, and, plunging his foot into the vacant leg, with a sort
                  of frantic looseness, he brought on the very catastrophe he was so anxious to
                  avoid. The chair collapsed with a sudden
                  "scrouch," pitching Nehemiah heels over head through the curtain, and he made his
                  grand entrance among the stitching divinities on all fours, like a fettered
                  rhinoceros.
               
                  
               
               Perhaps Collier himself never exhibited a more striking group of tableaux vivantes than was now displayed. Nehemiah was
                  a "model," every inch of him, and though not exactly "revolving on a pedestal," he
                  was going through that movement quite as effectually on his back, kicking,
                  plunging, in short personifying in thirty seconds all the attitudes ever
                  "chiselled!" As for the gals, they screamed of course, jumped upon chairs and the
                  cutting board, threw their hands over their faces, peeped through their fingers,
                  screamed again, and declared "they should, die, they knew they should!"
               "Oh, Lord!" blubbered the distressed young 'un, "dont holler so, gal's, don't. I
                  didn't go tew, I swan to man I didn't; it's all owing to them cussed trowsers,
                  every mite on't. Ask yer boss, he'll tell yer fow 'twas. Oh Lordy, won't nobody
                  kiver me up with old clothes, or turn the wood-box over me? Oh, Moses, in the
                  bulrushes! what'll Nancy say?"
               He managed to raise himself on his feet, and made a bold splurge towards the door,
                  but his "entangling alliances" tripped him up again, and he fell "kerslap" upon
                  the hot goose of the pressman! This was the unkindest cut of all. The goose had
                  been heated expressly for thick cloth seams, and the way it sizzled in the seat of
                  the new pants was afflicting to the wearer. Nehemiah riz up in an instant, and
                  seizing the source of all his troubles by the slack, he tore himself free from all
                  save the straps and some pantalet-like fragments that hung about his ankles, as he
                  dashed through the door of the emporium at a two-forty pace Nehemiah seemed to
                  yearn with the poet, for "a lodge in some vast wilderness," and betrayed a settled
                  purpose to "flee from the busy haunts of men," for the last seen of him he was
                  capering up the railroad—cutting like a scared rabbit, the rays of the declining
                  sun flickering and dancing upon a broad expanse of shirt tail that fluttered gaily
                  in the breeze, as he headed for the nearest woods.
            
            
               TAKING CARE OF THE BABY.
               OR, TRIALS OF A BACHELOR.
               THERE was no one at home except baby's mother, and baby, and I. Baby had just gone
                  to sleep, when baby's mother remembered a trifling commission which she had
                  promised to execute for me in the village. With an injunction to touch the cradle
                  if baby awoke, she departed leaving me proud of my new employment, and lulled by
                  past immunity into a state of fatal security. History is full of similar
                  examples.
               With one eye on my book, and the other on the cradle, like a faithful watch-dog, I
                  listened to the retreating footfall that should have warned me, but did not, "to
                  look out for squalls." I had no idea of the awful responsibility which I had taken
                  upon myself, or I should have shrunk from it as a cat does from water, or a
                  mastiff from a churning-machine. In fact, I rather suspect that I felt, in a
                  trifling degree, ambitious that baby should open one eye—only one—that I might
                  have the pleasure of shutting it again. Unwary mortal! How little do we know when
                  we are well off! My ambition was but too soon to be gratified; I had yet to learn
                  by bitter experience how weary is the lot of those who—tend on babies.
               I wonder whether infants are conscious in their sleep of their Mother's absence;
                  and know that an opportunity has arrived for exerting their lungs.
               
               The baby, over whose slumbers I had become the guardian genius—how the flies
                  pitched into its nose—was as sound asleep as any baby could be, when its mother
                  departed; but no sooner had her shadow faded from the room than symptoms of
                  wakefulness began to appear. First came a sigh; then a chuckle, that said as plain
                  as a chuckle could say, "now for some fun;" then one eye opened and shut, and then
                  both began peeping about, till the head seemed inclined to bob off the pillow.
               I felt a little nervous at these symptoms—only a little. "Poh!" said I to myself,
                  "a roll or two of the cradle will soon settle the youngster." But it did not. Baby
                  was bound to have a spree. It knew that "its mother was out." That big, bothersome
                  blue bottle fly, too, tired of watching for the ship over the clock face, started
                  on a  voyage of discovery on its own account; and the first promontory
                  which it reached was the nose of the baby, a tempting spot, upon which it landed
                  for refreshment, buzzing most villanously as it did so. It was a ticklish landing,
                  however, and baby soon drove it off with a sneeze that astonished its nerves, and
                  mine, too, more than the fly's, for the fly was accustomed to ticklish situations,
                  which I was not. Baby was thoroughly roused. Up went its round chubby arm; but a
                  rock of the cradle soon sent that back to its place. I did rock that cradle
                  beautifully. The little head rolled to and fro as easily as if it had been
                  fastened on by a toy mandarin's neck. I could not help admiring myself for the way
                  in which I did it, and I am sure that any reasonable baby would have gone to sleep
                  again, if only for compliments' sake; but the baby in the cradle didn't. The
                  moment the rocking ceased, up popped the little head, like Judy's in the show,
                  with a small peevish cry. That cry! it was like the "fizzing of the fuse" of a
                  powder-magazine, sure to end in an explosion.
               Were you ever roused in the middle of the night by the maid-of-all-work coming in
                  her slippers and night-cap to inform you that the house was on fire? Did you ever
                  stand near a Dutchman who was weighing gunpowder with a lighted segar in his
                  mouth? If not, you cannot conceive my horror when I heard that cry. I was in a
                  cold perspiration from head to foot. I have no doubt that hailstones as big as
                  peas might have been picked off my forehead. I rocked for dear life, and baby
                  bounced about like a ball of India-rubber. But it was all uselessness. I sang all
                  the songs that I could think of, from the cabalistic "Hushaby!" to "Cease, rude
                  Boreas!" I tried tenor, and I tried bass; but the baby did not know the
                  difference. It seemed to think it all base. The louder I sang, the louder it
                  cried. It was bawl and squall; and squall beat. The cry peevish became the cry
                  indignant and the cry indignant became the squall imperative. Blue-bottle buzzed
                  with delight, and danced a hornpipe on the window, while the clock kept up a
                  tantalizing "Go it! go it!"
               In an unlucky moment I lifted the little tempest out of the cradle. Never, never,
                  never will I commit such an act of thoughtless imprudence again! Before I did so,
                  I could have truly sung with the poet, "The white squall raves;" but afterwards
                  the fiercest blasts of Boreas seemed to come from that little throat.
               In the hope of quieting the tornado, I took baby in my arms, waddled it about the
                  room; tossed it up and down till my shoulders ached; dandled it on my knees, now
                  the right one, now the left; but nothing would do. Like an easterly gale, that
                  multiplied squall seemed to be endless. I felt really alarmed. I was completely
                  terrified. I saw visions of convulsions, and such like ills that infant "flesh is
                     heir to." If I had been in the city I
                  am sure that a crowd would have collected. I might have been taken up and accused
                  of an attempt commit infanticide—perhaps been published in the papers as a wretch
                  guilty of cruelty to dumb animals. Dumb! How I wished that the dear family organ
                     had been dumb! I even envied the deaf men that pick up
                  cinders.
               I looked at the clock and exclaimed, in despair, "When will the mother return?"
                  and the clock answered with mocking monotony, "Not yet! not yet!" Blue-bottle had
                  ceased its buzzing, and returned to its old quarters over the dial-plate, to watch
                  for the re-appearance of the ship; perhaps asking, as impatiently as I did, the
                  question, "When will she return?" While the clock continued to repeat,
                  unceasingly, "Not yet! not yet!"
               I knew not what to do, and rushed a dozen times to the door hoping to see the
                  promised relief. But the walls of the distant church and the houses beyond were
                  thick, and I could not look through them.
               There was a rooster upon the fence flapping his wings and crowing like a Trojan—I
                  do believe it was over my perplexity; the pigs were grunting in their sty, pulling
                  each other's ears for amusement; and a cow was giving nourishment to her calf in a
                  distant field. Suddenly a bright idea struck me. I seized an old tobacco-pipe that
                  had been stowed away upon the mantel-piece, and, immersing the bulb in a tumbler
                  of water, thrust the stem into the baby's mouth. Baby was no genius. I became
                  satisfied of that in a minute. It is an attribute genius to accomplish its desires
                  with imperfect instruments. There was no stoppage in the pipe. I tried it
                  myself.
               I was at my wits' ends, and laid the baby on the floor, cramming my fingers into
                  my ears. It was of no use. I could not shut out the sound. It was like a thousand
                  "ear-piercing pipes" drilling me through and through. I was riddled with screams
                  that touched like galvanic wires on every nerve. What would I not have given for
                  the sight of a petticoat bearing down to my relief? Never did Robinson Crusoe on
                  his desert island, gaze more longingly over the ocean search of a sail, than I did
                  down the road for a bonnet and curls. But the feminine, like other useful
                  commodities, had all vanished when most wanted. Even the cat, accustomed to
                  nursing as she was—even the cat, sensible creature, had disappeared. Like the
                  distressed hero of a novel, I was left to my own reflections, and had no resources
                  left. There was the baby flopping about the floor like a porpoise on a ship's
                  deck, as if lying on its beam ends were a natural position. I righted it a dozen
                  times, but over it went again, as if all its ballast had shifted to the head. I
                  brought the shovel and tongs, and the bellows from the fire-place, but baby
                  wouldn't look at them, not a bit of it, although I  took the trouble to
                  blow the bellows in the blue-bottle's face, and sent the threads on the carpet
                  flying about the room. Even the clothes brush and nutmeg-grater proved no
                  attraction, and I broke a brace-button in hopping about like a frog on all-fours.
                  If I had stood on my head, and shook the pennies out of my pockets, it would have
                  had no effect. Even a lump of sugar would not bribe it to be quiet. It made wry
                  faces at the mirror, and pitched savagely into the pillow, turned indignantly from
                  the tea-kettle, and squared off at the rolling-pin.
               For nearly a mortal hour—an age—was I thus kept in a state of frenzy. My hairs
                  stood up "like quills upon the fretful porcupine." They have always stubbornly
                  refused to lie down smoothly since. If my trials had lasted much longer, I should certainly have had
                  a "grey head upon young shoulders," perhaps have sunk into the grave with a
                  nervous fever, and had "Died of baby-nursing" for an epitaph upon my tombstone.
                  Fortunately for the public in general, and me in particular, I was spared such a
                  catastrophe by the return of the mother, who burst panting into the room at the
                  critical moment when my Job-like patience had miserably perished—by degrees, as
                  the water leaks from a broken hooped bucket. With what feeling of relief did I
                  look up at the old clock, as it announced in its most cheerful tones, "She's come!
                  she's come!"
               Would you believe it?—but I'm sure you can't, the fact seems too great an
                  enormity—that the little piece of perversity was as quiet as a lamb in a minute!
                  Why, the mother was so deceived, that she actually called it her "precious lamb!"
                  I heard her, and was astounded. I wonder she didn't feel sheepish; I know I did.
                  Lamb, indeed! If that was being lamb, what would it be when it became mutton? Why
                  it was fast asleep again in no time, and laughing in its dreams over the fun it
                  had enjoyed. Didn't I vow never to be caught alone with a baby again?
            
            
               A STORY ABOUT ROAST GOOSE.
               
                  
                  I THINK I may lay it down as a rule that when a man lives with his
                  mother for forty years—very comfortably, perhaps, but still in perfect subjection
                  to lady of superior strength of will and knowledge of the world—all trouble of
                  thinking and shifting for himself being taken off his shoulders, all his wants and
                  wishes gratified so long as he keeps within the maternal ken, and desires nothing
                  that the maternal judgment 
                     tninks
                     thinks
                   unreasonable or improper, he is not likely to be an individual any very
                  great force of character, or one whose natural and acquired powers are calculated
                  to conduct him unaided through any difficulty or sudden emergency.
               Such an individual was Mr. Joseph Bowpot, the hero of my story. His father had
                  died when he was about fifteen, leaving a tolerably good fortune, and a very good
                  representative in the person of his son. Mr. Bowpot, sen., was a husband who was
                  entirely governed by his wife; Mr Joseph Bowpot was a son who was entirely
                  governed by his mother. The subject was changed, but the ruler was the same.
               Mr Joseph Bowpot had all the appearance of a spoiled child of forty; he was short,
                  stout, dreamy in look, feeble in speech, unintellectual in expression, with a
                  small development of brain, and a large development of cheeks. His dress was
                  something between the schoolboy and the ungainly Quaker; it was chosen by his
                  mother, both the pattern and style.
               However, notwithstanding the peculiar appearance of Mr. Joseph Bowpot, and his
                  perfect faith in, and reliance upon his mother, he had a human heart beating in
                  his bosom—a heart that was as susceptible to the tender passion as any other
                  heart—perhaps more susceptible than many. Mr. Joseph Bowpot was in love and
                  engaged. The young lady (who I need not say was approved of by his mother,
                  otherwise he would not have dared to think of her for a single moment), was a
                  family connexion, a second cousin, or something of the kind, who resided at Little
                  Mildhampton, Salthamptonshire; and both Joseph and his mother were invited down to
                  spend the Christmas holidays at that very charming place, and with very charming
                  company.
               They were to go down by rail on the morning of Christmas Eve, and very busy
                  preparations in the Bowpot mansion were being made for their departure. These
                  preparations were left entirely to Mrs. Bowpot; Joseph was left undisturbed to his
                  reflections.
               Mr. Joseph Bowpot was very glad that they had been invited, as it gave him a
                  chance of spending a month with his Amelia—a month of happiness, but not, he
                  thought, of undisturbed happiness; for he was conscious of his many social
                  deficiencies. He would in all probability be asked to ride and shoot, and he had
                  never fired a gun, or touched a horse in his life. Most assuredly he would be
                  asked to sing, and he knew no songs; asked to dance, and he had not danced for
                  twenty-five years, since he was at school; but what he feared worse than all was
                  the certainty, as his uncle was not alive, of his being asked to carve, and take
                  the head of the table. Of course, he never carved at home, and of all the defects
                  in his education, this was the greatest.
               Mr. Joseph Bowpot, though not a gentleman of brilliant ability, was not totally
                  deficient in common sense, and since his engagement to his cousin, a few weak
                  germs of self-reliance had developed themselves. He had positively acted once or
                  twice without consulting his mother; and
                  he now, after much reflection, acted so again, by purchasing unknown to her a
                  "Comic Warbler," a "Ball-room Guide," and Miss Acton's Cookery-book, containing
                  the whole art of carving. The "Comic Warbler" embraced the usual assortment of
                  songs—some with bits of spoken composition stuck in between the verses—some with
                  very bad spelling and transposed V's and W's, which were considered to be
                  extremely funny, and others with choruses of inordinate length in which "tooral
                  looral" was rather prominent. Joseph, after much deliberation, fixed upon the
                  "Cork Leg," thinking it, no doubt, a novelty, and fancying that it suited his
                  voice; and for many days the upper garret of the Bowpot mansion was made musical
                  with its familiar chorus.
               This was the lightest task of the three; for mastering the mysteries of the
                  "Ball-room Guide"—in which the different figures of the quadrilles were set forth
                  almost as mysteriously as the stitches in a crochet book, reminded him very
                  forcibly of those days of Euclid that he thought had gone, never to return again.
                  As to the art of carving in Miss Acton's book, that was, indeed, a collection of
                  inscrutable problems. Those were maddening diagrams of the hare, the rabbit, the
                  duck, the pigeon, the fowl, the leg of mutton, the sirloin of beef, and the roast
                  goose, all mapped out with lines and figures, like the plan of an estate belonging
                  to a freehold land society, and with directions underneath as to where the fork
                  was to be placed, and as to the course it was proper for the dissecting knife to
                  take.
               Mr. Joseph Bowpot devoted himself assiduously to his studies, but his progress was
                  not very rapid; and by the time the morning of their departure—the morning of
                  Christmas Eve—came round, he had very imperfectly committed to memory the words
                  and tune of the "Cork Leg," the figures of "Payne's First Set," and some few
                  diagrams in the art of carving—section, poultry; hopelessly mixing together the
                  fowl, the duck, and the roast goose.
               The time arrived to start; everything was in readiness under Mrs. Bowpot's
                  guidance; the cab was at the door; the presents were put inside; the shawls and
                  rugs were placed upon the seats; the bags and boxes were piled upon the roof; and
                  Mrs. Bowpot and Joseph took their places, the latter attired in a rough
                  travelling-suit, with wrappers and comforters, looking not unlike a member of
                  Captain Parry's expedition to the North Pole. In about half an hour they arrived
                  at the railway station, when Mrs. Bowpot, of course, fought out the battle of
                  fares with the cabman, took the tickets for Little Mildhampton, saw the luggage
                  labelled and placed in the van amidst all the din and bustle of a terminus the day
                  before Christmas-day, and, finally, selected the carriage in which they were to
                  travel. The bell rang, they took their places, the last basket of fish was tossed
                  in, the doors were slammed to and locked, and with a grind, a screech, and a
                  whistle, they were fairly on the road for Little Mildhampton.
               On they went smoothly enough, stopping at very few stations; and, after the first
                  twenty miles, Mrs. Bowpot, who, like her son, was of a full habit of body, and who
                  was fatigued with the exertion of preparing for their departure, and from having
                  risen at an early hour, fell fast asleep in the comfortable compartment of their
                  first-class carriage. Joseph's mind was too much occupied in revolving the comic
                  song, the quadrille, and the carving, for him to think of sleep.
               Joseph was always very regular with his meals—in fact he was rather addicted to
                  the pleasures of the table—and therefore, when the train arrived at the Swindleham
                  station, about one o'clock in the day, and the guard announced that "ten minutes
                  were allowed for refreshment," Joseph felt very much inclined to see what
                  refreshment was to be had. Mrs. Bowpot still slept, and Joseph did not wake her,
                     but stepping quietly over her
                  rug-protected feet, he passed on to the platform and through two sets of large
                  swinging doors into the refreshment-room. Old as Mr. Joseph Bowpot was, this was
                  his first railway journey of any length, and he was rather bewildered by the large
                  room with its Turkey carpets, its mirrors and couches, its clatter of coffee-cups,
                  and its semicircular counter, round which were a crowd of eager devourers waited
                  upon by a bevy of young ladies. After some little time he caught a waiter's eye;
                  the waiter said "Soup?" and Joseph said, "Yes;" and he found himself sitting at a
                  round-table, with a basin of thick brown solid liquor, and the train standing
                  before him outside the window. The soup being hot, it took Joseph some time to
                  finish it; and when he had done, and had called the waiter to pay him, he noticed
                  that the room was very quiet, the devourers had gone, and the young ladies had
                  disappeared; nevertheless, the train was in the same position. He passed on to the
                  platform, and there noticed a great stillness, very unlike what he expected to
                  find on the eve of the starting of an important train. He looked into the
                  carriages one after another to discover his mother, and to his consternation found
                  them all empty. A porter, fancying that something was wrong, at this moment came
                  up to him. "What train be ye lookin' fur, sur?" he inquired.
               "Little Mildhampton," returned Joseph, rather nervously.
               "No train till to-morrow marnin' at eight, sur."
               "Well, but," exclaimed poor Joseph, in a state of nervous alarm, I've just left
                  it—there's my luggage, and my mother, and——"
               "Ah," rejoined the intelligent porter, "thee'st cum wrang side, this be's
                  Zuummerset; that there's Salthamptonsheer."
               It was too true. The unfortunate Bowpot had passed through the refreshment-room to
                  the wrong side, and had fixed his unsophisticated gaze upon a train on another
                  line of rails, that was destined for a part of the country far removed from that
                  to which he wanted to go. His unconscious sleeping mother was separated from her
                  son—like Evangeline from her lover—for the first time—during a long and arduous
                  career of forty years; to wake in an agony of astonishment and terror in the
                  middle of a tunnel or a deep cutting.
               Mr. Joseph Bowpot—nervous, sensitive, and inexperienced—thrown suddenly upon his
                  own resources, was of course in a very helpless state, and ready to be governed by
                  any advice that was offered him. Little Mildhampton being a small place, it was
                  too true that there would be no other train thither that day; and on the
                  intelligent porter suggesting that Joseph should take a seat in the railway 'bus,
                  and go down to the hotel at Swindleham, he at once consented, and in a few minutes
                  found himself bumping along the country lanes towards the town, in a very light,
                  curious vehicle, licensed to carry eight inside, but built only to carry four.
               Swindleham is a place that has sprung into importance within the last few years.
                  It was one of the earliest towns to throw off the anti-progressive spirit of the
                  stage-coach, and to assume an aspect of progress and activity. It built a new
                  market-hall, a concert-room, and two chapels; and the principal inn in the town,
                  which stood in the market-place, turned its large rambling coach yard into the
                  assembly and billiard-rooms, and, with a new front, abolished the old-fashioned
                  title of "inn," and dubbed itself the "Royal George Hotel."
               It was to this magnificent structure that Mr. Joseph Bowpot was bumped up the High
                  Street, in a very uncomfortable frame of mind, compounded of reproach for his
                  adventurous stupidity in losing his train—regret that Amelia, by living in the
                  country, had been the innocent cause of all this trouble—doubt as to the propriety
                  of his present course of action—and very great fear as to how he should conduct
                  himself at the hotel until the morning. In the midst of his reflections, the
                  bounding 'bus pulled up sharply at the door-step of the "Royal George Hotel," and
                  to add to Joseph's discomfiture, he heard the ringing of many bells, when there
                  immediately appeared to welcome the distinguished arrival a very stiff, clean,
                  gentlemanly waiter, the incarnate representation of the new order of things at the
                  "hotel"—a chambermaid and a "boots." Joseph got out far from briskly, and his
                  nervousness was somewhat increased when the "boots" asked him if his luggage was
                  to go up at once to a room. If he had had the boldness then to state his real
                  position, he would have avoided much trouble and suspicion; but he allowed the
                  opportunity to slip, and was bowed into the coffee-room with impressive silence.
                  He sent out a shilling, to pay the
                  'busman, and he had scarcely got his outer comforter off, when it was indignantly
                  returned by that deeply-wronged personage as being bad, or, as he termed it, a
                  "duffer." Joseph looked hard at it, and so did the stiff waiter, and, what is
                  more, the stiff waiter looked hard at Joseph. Joseph threw it down upon the table,
                  and although it made a sound like a lump of putty, he thought it could not be bad;
                  but the "boots," who was waiting at the door to take another coin in exchange put
                  it between his teeth and bit it into two pieces, which settled the point as to its
                  value. Another coin was tendered with like success, for this time there was a
                  faint inscription round the rim, advising you to "Buy Nankin's fine, full-flavored
                  Congou," which, in the eyes of the 'busman, jaundiced as they were by suspicion,
                  was a decided depreciation of its value as a piece of circulating specie. The
                  third attempt to settle the claim was more successful, and the first difficulty
                  was got over.
               When Joseph had surveyed his appearance in the coffee-room mirrors—the first
                  chance he had ever had in his lifetime of getting a fair view of himself—whatever
                  his faith in the general force and ability of his mother might have been, I think
                  his belief was a little shaken in her taste about masculine dress. The material of
                  his body garment was coarse and unsightly—being one uniform color, neither red,
                  brown nor yellow, but a mixture of the three; this was called a "travelling suit,"
                  and, with a long overcoat that reached to his heels, was cut in a style that was
                  considered the correct thing when his late respected father was a youth about
                  town. The stiff, gentlemanly waiter seemed paralysed as he gazed upon him; but he
                  made no remarks, and attended with dignity and silence to the duties of his
                  office. Mr. Joseph Bowpot, it is unnecessary to say, soon felt in awe of that
                  calm, cool stiff, silent waiter.
               "Have you any orders, sir, for dinner?" the stiff waiter blandly inquired.
               Joseph, as I have said before, was always ready for dinner; it was his great meal;
                  he watched for it, and he reserved himself for it; his love of eating would make
                  him even adventurous for a time, as we say at the railway station; and when he
                  heard from the stiff waiter that a splendid roast goose was preparing, he threw
                  off, for a moment, his nervousness and timidity, and boldly ordered it in.
               When the mandate had gone forth, the vision of his ignorance of carving arose
                  before him, and he rushed to the pocket of his overcoat for the friendly volume of
                  Acton, which he had providently placed there along with the "Ball-room Guide" and
                  the "Comic Warbler."
               Instead of sitting before the fire, poring over the "Times" of the day before, and
                  the county paper, he turned to the familiar page (No. 48—article, Roast Goose, in
                  the "Art of Carving,") and read up again for the forthcoming struggle.
               While he was ruminating over the instructions, "Take your fork firmly in your left
                  hand, and plant it securely in the figure 4, &c.," looking at the diagram, and
                  turning it about to ascertain at what part of the real bird the "figure 4" was
                  likely to be, muttering all the while complaints of the inartistic character, and
                  want of clearness in the drawings, the stiff waiter had silently laid the cloth on
                  a table between the two bow windows commanding a view of the market-place, and he
                  now formally announced that dinner was ready.
               Mr. Joseph Bowpot took his seat very slowly at the table, while the stiff waiter
                  removed the cover from that smoking goose. Joseph made a great display in
                  sharpening his knife, turning up the cuffs of his coat, afterwards his wristbands,
                  then sharpening his knife again, trying it with his thumb, evidently waiting for
                  the stiff waiter to leave the room.
               It was half-past three o'clock, and being a wintry afternoon, it was getting
                  dusk.
               "Would you like the gas lighted, sir?" inquired the stiff waiter.
               "Not at all—not at all," returned Joseph, hurriedly. "I don't think you need
                  wait."
               The stiff waiter took the hint, but he regarded Joseph with a peculiar
                  expression—made up of curiosity, contempt, and suspicion.
               Joseph looked carefully round the room, and finding that he was really alone, he
                  drew the "Art of Carving" from his pocket, and opening it at page 48, he set it up
                  before him against the cruet-stand, reading it across the goose, like a piece of
                  music.
               "Now," said Joseph, "'Take your fork firmly in your left hand,' so, (grasping his
                  fork tightly). 'Plant it securely in the figure 4.' That's about the figure 4, I
                  think, (feeling for the spot with his fingers). Very well: now to 'plant the fork
                  securely,' (trying to stick the fork in.) Eh! What? Why there's a confounded bone!
                  Try a little on one side (shifts the fork). No: bone there also. Why, hang it,
                  it's all bone! Stay, perhaps I've got the wrong side. Confound these artists, I
                  wish they'd draw better. It's no more like a goose than I am! Suppose we turn over
                  gently; wo! (Turns the goose over, gingerly.) There goes the gravy all over the
                  table and my trousers! (Sops it up with his pocket-handkerchief, looking round
                  once or twice anxiously at the door.) Now
                  then, once more; let's see; where were we? Oh, on No. 4."
               At this moment the stiff waiter appeared at the door. "I beg your pardon, sir," he
                  asked; "did you ring?"
               "No, thankee, no," said Joseph, confusedly; "I am getting on nicely."
               The stiff waiter retired.
               "I wish that person would not be so officious," exclaimed Joseph, rather
                  pettishly; "he's quite put me out. Dear, dear," he continued, piteously, "how cold
                  the bird's getting. 'Plant your fork firmly in 4.' (Sticks the fork in.) That's
                  all right. What's next? 'Draw your knife across from the point marked 6, through
                  the figures 8 and 10 until you arrive at 12.' Halloo! That's precious complicated!
                  (Reads slowly, following the directions by corresponding actions with the knife.)
                  'Draw your knife across'—so—this confounded knife won't cut—'through the figures 8
                  and 10, until you arrive at 12.' That's about here. (Stops the motion of his
                  knife.) 'You then, by a dexterous twist of the wrist, separate the two legs from
                  the body.' (Pausing.) How dexterous twist? (Perplexed.) Somehow like this, I
                  suppose? Good gracious!" He braced himself up for a great effort, but,
                  unfortunately, instead of being successful, he twisted the goose off the table on
                  to the floor, between his feet. For some reason, the stiff waiter again made his
                  appearance.
               "Ring, sir?" he inquired, more laconically than usual.
               Joseph in his trepidation seized the dish cover, and clapped it on to empty dish,
                  holding it down with his hand, while he turned round the pertinacious waiter, and
                  with something of indignation in his tone replied:
               "I did not ring; I tell you, I did not ring."
               "Hem!" was the answer of the stiff waiter, as he again retired.
               Joseph gradually recovered himself, took off the cover, and lifting the goose up
                  tenderly with both hands from the floor, he placed it again upon the dish, and
                  took a couple of glasses of sherry to fortify himself for a final effort.
               "Oh, that extremely officious person," he muttered to himself; "he has thrown me
                  into a profuse perspiration. Dear me, the bird's as cold as a stone."
               He took a couple more glasses of wine.
               "I've not," he continued, "tasted substantial food for eight hours and I feel the
                  pangs of hunger. Why should I hesitate? No one observes me. I will."
               He looked round, and finding himself unobserved, he tore off a leg with his hand,
                  and hacked several small pieces off the surface, eating ravenously all the time.
                  Cold as the bird was, he ate, or rather  devoured, a fair quantity; and
                  by the time his appetite was satisfied, the temporary courage inspired by his
                  half-pint of sherry was exhausted along with the wine, and he relapsed into his
                  original state of excitement. Suddenly his eyes became fixed upon the dish.
               "Good gracious!" he almost shrieked; "what a horrid spectacle! The goose don't
                  look as if it had been carved; it looks as if it had been worried by a bull
                  terrier!"
               After reflecting for some moments, he continued:—
               "It must never leave the room in that state. I'd rather burn it first. That
                  wouldn't do either, because of the smell; I should have an engine here in five
                  minutes. Good, a thought strikes me. I'll give it away to some one in the street,
                  and perform an act of charity at this festive season. It's a pity to waste it; it
                  shows the remains of a fine bird. even now."
               Acting upon his resolve, Joseph went to the window and looked out. It was now
                  quite dusk; the market-place was quiet, common-looking looking man, half tramp, half stable-lounger, who
                  appeared as if he had not dined for some days, was walking up and down.
               Joseph made several ineffectual attempts to catch his eye by nodding beckoning,
                  and crying "Hist! hi!"
               "Now he sees me," he said. "I must break the offer to him gradually, or he may be
                  alarmed, and raise the neighborhood;" saying which poor distracted Joseph sank
                  despondingly into a chair by the window.
               The individual—whom, for want of knowing his real name, I will call
                  Smoucher—arrived at the window with wonderful alacrity, and looking through into
                  the half-darkened room, touched his cap.
               "Beg yer pardon, sur," he said; "did you call me?"
               "I did," replied Joseph, almost impressively.
               "Did yer honor want yer samples taken round the town?"
               "My what?"
               "Yer samples," returned Smoucher, who evidently took Joseph for a commercial
                  traveller bent upon business after dinner.
               "No," replied Joseph, without understanding clearly what he meant, "that was not
                  my object in calling you; I wished to inquire whether you had dined."
               "Dined, sir!" returned Smoucher in an incredulous tone; "Now, nonsense; yer poking
                  fun at me. I never dines."
               "Never dine!" exclaimed Joseph in amazement; "can't you carve?"
               "Can't I carve? Rather!—if I only gets suffin to carve; but mindin' gents' 'orses,
                  and runnin' arrands, don't bring in anything werry strikin' for dinner worth
                  speakin' on."
               "Hum!" thought poor Joseph, "he can carve! Half-starved tramp as he
                  is, yet is he superior to me with all my creature comforts. But, good gracious,
                  that officious waiter may come into the room—I must bring this business to a
                  close." Addressing himself to Smoucher, he said:—"Would you like a portion of
                  roast goose?" adding faintly:
               "I've hardly touched it."
               "A what, sur!" asked Smoucher, in astonishment.
               "A roast goose."
               "I should, indeed, sur," replied Smoucher, overcome, "and thankee kindly; I'm
                  werry much obligated, I'm sure; an' if there's anything—"
               "No thanks," interposed Joseph, decisively; "got anything to put it in?"
               "Well, sur," said Smoucher, with some hesitation—"if you wouldn't mind my
                  hankercher."
               "No."
               Joseph took the handkerchief tenderly between his finger and thumb, as it was very
                  old and rather dirty. His excitement increased as he thought he heard the
                  footsteps of the officious waiter in the passage he hurried to the table, and
                  nastily turned the contents of the dish—namely, the goose and a large
                  gravy-spoon—into the handkerchief glancing nervously all the while at the door,
                  and scarcely knowing what he was about, in the dusk and in his excessive
                  trepidation.
               Smoucher's feelings, during this brief interval, had evidently under gone a
                  revulsion. He leant coolly on the window-sill, looking into the room, and
                  remarked, almost loud enough for Joseph to hear him: "The gent must be
                  cranky!"
               Joseph returned to the window, and gave him the bundle, saying,—"There—now go
                  away—there's a good man!" but Smoucher, who had made up his mind that something
                  was wrong, began to grow impertinent.
               "Beg yer pardon, sur," he said, "but couldn't you throw in a tater or two?"
               Joseph fetched several potatoes from the table, which he hastily thrust into
                  Smoucher's handkerchief.
               "There," said Joseph nervously; "now be off!"
               "Beg yer pardon, again, yer honor," continued the troublesome Smoucher, "but
                  eatin' 's dry work, and I should like to drink yer honor's health at this 'ere
                  festive season."
               "There's sixpence—now go away," replied Joseph, his nervousness increasing as he
                  pushed Smoucher from the window.
               "I shall never forget your honor."
               "No more!" shouted Joseph in a frenzy; and Smoucher disappeared; while Joseph sank
                  exhausted against the window-sill, like a sea-sick passenger over the bulwarks of
                  a vessel.
               The stiff waiter had entered the room, and lighted the gas, before Joseph was
                  aware of his hateful presence. When Joseph turned and saw him there, he sank in a
                  chair near the window, regarding him wildly, and still holding the sill with one
                  hand.
               "Take away, sir?" asked the stiff waiter.
               "Y-e-s," replied Joseph, in a faint and agitated voice; "take away."
               "Aint you well, sir?" inquired the stiff waiter, with unwonted tenderness.
               "I feel a little qualmy—a slight attack of indigestion—that's all."
               This was addressed to the stiff waiter, in answer to his inquiry; but the words
                  fell upon a listless ear.
               
               That individual was standing transfixed with astonishment before the empty dish
                  that had contained the goose. Joseph divined what was passing in his mind. He had
                  hardly calculated the effect that the discovery of the disappearance of the goose
                  would have; and his qualminess increased. The stiff waiter was a man of few words,
                  and he said nothing; but his look was awful—his stiffness seemed to increase; and
                  an attentive listener might have heard him say quietly, as he went out of the door
                  carrying the empty dish, "Well—if that aint a case of hapoplexy, this hotel's not
                  the Royal George."
               A more serious phase in Mr. Joseph Bowpot's dilemma now developed itself. The fact
                  had dawned upon him that he had given away the silver gravy spoon with the goose.
                  Slight symptoms of insanity began to show themselves; he danced a little, and said
                  something about stealing a gravy spoon being seven years; and that when his Amelia
                  and his mother saw him again, he would be a ticket-of-leave convict. When the
                  stiff waiter entered the room again, Joseph had calmed down somewhat, and was
                  making considerable display of combing his scanty hair before the mirror over the
                  mantel-shelf.
               The stiff waiter took a rapid survey of the apartment; under the tables, and in
                  the fire-place, and the result was to confirm his previous astonishment. He sought
                  for no explanation, but as he was going out with the rest of the dishes, he said
                  to Joseph, in his usual subdued manner:—
               "Take cheese, sir?"
               "Yes," replied Joseph, with affected calmness; "I think I will."
               "A whole cheese, sir?"
               The sarcasm fell unheeded upon the ears of Joseph, who was too much occupied with
                  a sudden project that he had conceived of getting out of the window, and scouring
                  the town until he found the man he had given the goose and the spoon to. He felt
                  the necessity of getting the spoon back at any cost. He did not feel courage
                  enough to go out of the door, and therefore as soon as the stiff waiter's back was
                  turned, he quickly slipped on his greatcoat, and with some little difficulty
                  squeezed himself through the open window into the street, sacrificing one of his
                  braces in the struggle.
               When the stiff waiter returned with the whole cheese, and found the apartment
                  empty—he was not surprised; his suspicions were merely confirmed. The
                  strange appearance—the stranger behavior—the bad shilling—the absence of
                  luggage—all were conclusive proofs in his mind of a deliberate attempt, by an
                  eccentric and accomplished swindler, to do the Royal George Hotel. The notion he
                  had once cherished that Mr. Joseph Bowpot was merely an excessively greedy
                  visitor, who devoured all before him, regardless of appearances or apoplectic
                  fits,  now gave way to a strong belief that he was a swindler, at least,
                  if not something worse; perhaps a burglar! This latter supposition was immediately
                  confirmed by the entrance of the mistress of the hotel—a stout, red-faced woman,
                  of the Mrs. Bowpot school—as all women are who are left widows to manage hotels.
                  The mistress of the Royal George was a prompt woman of business, and without
                  looking round the room, or without ally preamble, she at once said to the stiff
                  waiter:—
               "Emmanuel, where's the silver gravy spoon?"
               "Mim?" said the stiff waiter, becoming at last very limp, and looking nervously at
                  the open window.
               "The gravy spoon?" reiterated the decisive landlady in a louder key.
               "Didn't I bring it out, Mim, with the dish?" asked the now very limp waiter, very
                  faintly.
               "No," was the prompt answer, like the blow of a hammer.
               "Then"—returned the limp waiter, looking hurriedly round the room, "he's taken
                  it."
               "Who's taken it?"
               "The gent who was here just now; a regular burglar, Mim; he eat the whole goose,
                  and now he's bolted with the plate."
               "Ate a whole goose?" asked the landlady, in utter astonishment.
               "Bones and all, Mim; and he's gone out o' that window."
               The conversation was here interrupted by the opening of the coffee room door,
                  slowly and gently, and the appearance of Smoucher entering timidly with his cap in
                  one hand, and a bundle in the other. Smoucher was not very well known in the town;
                  for he had not been long down from London. The landlady, however, recognised him
                     as an idle, dirty fellow, lounging
                  about the Swindleham streets, and the excited imagination of the limp waiter
                  pictured him as another of the desperate gang in league with the suspected Joseph.
                  The landlady also began, as she thought, to see a concerted scheme to rob the
                  place and this induced her to be cautious, and even polite, in addressing
                  Smoucher, in the hope of discovering what the plot really was; while the limp
                  waiter was marvelling much why he was not immediately sent down to the Swindleham
                  lock-up.
               "What is it, my man?" said the landlady, in an assumed cheerful tone, with courage
                  on her lips, but fear in her heart.
               "Beg yer pardon, mum," replied Smoucher, slowly advancing; "no offence, I hope;
                  but is the short, stout party in wot dined here?"
               "No, he's not, at present," returned the landlady, very charmingly now fully
                  convinced that an accomplice stood before her, who was not ripe yet for
                  unmasking.
               "Oh," said Smoucher, reflectively.
               "Anything I can do for you?" kindly inquired the landlady.
               "No, thankee, mum," returned Smoucher, making a movement to leave the room. "I
                  want to see the party myself on wery partikler bisness, and I'd better look in
                  agen."
               This would not have suited the views of the affable landlady, and she therefore
                  begged that Smoucher would take a seat, while she sent a messenger to fetch the
                  gentleman. As the fire looked very comfortable, Smoucher accepted the offer,
                  although so much politeness made him suspicious. The limp waiter, under the
                  directions of his mistress, handed him a chair, on which he seated himself,
                  depositing his bundle carefully between his legs. The limp waiter made a motion to
                  relieve him of this burden, which Smoucher decidedly resisted.
               "Thankee," said he, rather doggedly; "yer wery kind and attentive. It'll do wery
                  well where it is."
               The waiter and the landlady having retired from the room to concert operations,
                  leaving the door well guarded by nearly all the servants in the house, Smoucher's
                  object in returning to the hotel was then developed in a little soliloquy which he
                  muttered to himself as he sat before the fire:—
               "I wonder whether that rum gent knew he wrop'd up a great silver spoon along o'
                  that goose? It don't strike me he did. Howsomever, there can't be any harm in
                  bringing it back. If I kep' it, I might get into trouble, an' the gent may stan'
                  half a sov. if he gets it back on the quiet. I wonder what he guv' me that goose
                  for?"
               These reflections were interrupted by a noise outside the coffee-room door, which
                  now stood a little ajar, and the quick eye of Smoucher detected the servants on
                  the watch.
               "Now what can you mean?" thought Smoucher. "That looks to me wery
                  like a plant. That party's surely never been a doin' anything wrong and a draggin'
                  o' me into the mess. Oh, impossible! An' yet, what did he han' over that goose
                  for? Bein' so precious lib'ral don't look wery serene! There's that blessed spoon,
                  too. What a case it will be if he comes in an' blabs out about that with all that
                  kit in the passage! This comes o' bein' honest."
               At this moment the distracted Bowpot, who had run all round the market-place, and
                  up the High Street, without, of course, finding Smoucher, appeared at the window
                  very much out of breath. He could scarcely trust his eyes when he saw Smoucher
                  sitting by the fire, and he exclaimed in a very audible tone—
               "That form!" This caused Smoucher to look round, which drew from Bowpot another
                  exclamation—
               "That face!" saying which he struggled through the window. "I'm blow'd if he aint
                  gettin' in at the window!" exclaimed the astonished Smoucher. "Oh, he must be
                  cranky! He'll bust out about that spoon the very first thing, an' I shall get
                  lagged for petty larceny! I'll purtend not to know 'im." Bowpot had by this time,
                  at the sacrifice of a waistcoat-band, got safely through the window, and he now
                  advanced joyously towards Smoucher, exclaiming breathlessly—
               "Why, how long have you been here? I've been looking for you everywhere."
               Smoucher, carrying out his determination, replied dubiously, "I don't think I ever
                  see you afore, sur?"
               Bowpot, on hearing this, started back, crying aloud, "That face. I can't be
                  mistaken; it must be!" (Smoucher was getting very uneasy, as he saw the
                  coffee-room door open wider and wider.) Bowpot continued—"Where's the gravy
                  spoon?"
               Smoucher made several mysterious pantomimic signs, saying, in a subdued tone—
               "Don't be a blessed fool!"
               "I a blessed fool," shouted Bowpot, indignantly. "Don't make faces at me, you
                  ungrateful fellow. Is that the return for the goose I gave you? I say again,
                  where's the gravy spoon?"
               "It's all up," said Smoucher resignedly.
               Bowpot's eye had caught sight of Smoucher's bundle, and he rushed towards it,
                  Smoucher vainly interposing, exclaiming—
               "Ha! what do I see? I know that handkerchief—I know that pattern!" He seized the bundle, and squeezing said
                  joyfully—"It's here! feel it! Yes; the gravy spoon!"
               He plucked the spoon out in triumph, throwing the bundle again on 
                     he
                     the
                   floor, and executing a feeble dance.
               "There," said Smoucher, sullenly, "now you've done it."
               This remark applied to a rush of servants that he saw coming through the door. The
                  boots and the limp waiter made it their business to seize Mr. Joseph Bowpot.
                  
               
               Smoucher was taken care of by an ostler and a stout stable-boy; while the mistress
                  of the hotel, and a number of housemaids and chambermaids, made up the background
                  of the picture.
               "Unhand me directly, sir," said Joseph to the limp waiter.
               "What game d'ye call this?" coolly asked Smoucher.
               A scene of tremendous excitement now took place. A boy was despatched down the
                  town for the single constable and the handcuffs. Poor Bowpot, after the first
                  struggle, became paralysed. One of the housemaids took up Smoucher's bundle, and
                  the remains of the mangled goose fell out.
               "The goose!" exclaimed the limp waiter.
               "Lor!" chorused the women.
               "How shamefully it's been treated," said the landlady, picking it up.
               "The accursed bird!" faintly muttered Joseph.
               "Oh! ain't he swearin'!" announced the boots to the company generally.
               "There goes my supper," thought Smoucher.
               The active ostler, boots, boys, and limp waiter, began the precautionary task of
                  bandaging the prisoners before the arrival of the town handcuffs.
               "You're quite mistaken, you are indeed," said Joseph, appealingly; "I may be weak,
                  but I am not guilty."
               "I never see the gent afore to-day in my life," said Smoucher, "when he—"
               What Smoucher was about to state was interrupted by a noise outside the
                  coffee-room door, and a powerful female voice was heard exclaiming in indignant
                  tones:—"Not a waiter; not a boots to take my luggage! Am I in a respectable hotel,
                  or am I in a low pot-house?"
               In that strong voice Bowpot heard the familiar tones of his mother; and although
                  he felt somewhat ashamed of his position, he was relieved now of all fear of
                  having to pass his Christmas Eve in the  lockup of Swindleham. Mrs.
                  Bowpot entered the room with a dignified air that was unmistakeable.
               She knew her son was there, for the people at the station and the 'busman had told
                  her so, but she was hardly prepared to find him with his arms bandaged with a
                  table-cloth. At this moment the boy who had been sent for the constable returned,
                  and, running past Mrs. Bowpot, exclaimed:—"Oh, please, the constable's laid up wi'
                  rheumatiz; but he's sent his little gal wi' the han'cuffs."
               Mrs. Bowpot heard this, and she advanced to the shrinking, but immensely relieved Joseph, speaking not so much to
                  him as to the whole room—"Handcuffs! Joseph! What means all this? Are you mad—or
                  drunk—or what?"
               The landlady, impressed by Mrs. Bowpot, had ordered the bandages to be removed,
                  and the unfortunate Joseph was now at liberty. He saw that an explanation was
                  necessary, and he attempted one:—
               "Respected parent, it is with feelings of the deepest humiliation that I appear
                  before you in my present degraded position; but you're the innocent cause—my
                  education has been neglected—"
               "To the point at once, sir," replied the respected parent sternly.
               "I couldn't help it," continued Joseph wanderingly. "I planted my fork firmly in
                  four—I gave my wrist a dexterous twist—I—"
               "Planted his fork firmly in four!" shouted his mother. "He hasn't injured anyone?
                  He hasn't committed murder?"
               Mrs. Bowpot's anxiety being relieved upon this point, and Joseph being evidently
                  incapable, in his present depressed state, of giving anything like an explanation,
                  Smoucher was left to clear up the mystery and his own character at the same time,
                  which he did as follows:—
               "I was a-standin' in the market a-waitin' for any job as might turn up, when I see
                  that gent a-beckonin' o' me at the winder. Course I walks up; when he ses to me,
                  'Would you like a porshun o' rost goose?' them was his exact words, and I wasn't
                  fool enough, o' course, to say, no. Then he wrops up the goose in my handkercher,
                  an' along wi' it he wrops up that wery spoon as all this blessed row's about.
                  Course when I finds that out, I ses, that gent never meant to give me that spoon;
                  so I brings it back, and sees the gent, and was about to make it all right, when
                  they 'as us both nailed for bu'glary."
               This lucid statement of Smoucher's satisfied all parties. The servants, along with
                  Smoucher, retired to the kitchen to laugh over the story and a good bowl of spiced
                  ale. Joseph and his mother passed the Christmas Eve in the little bar-parlor.
                  There Joseph learned that mother, as soon as she woke in the train, and found him
                  missing, had, with her usual decision of character, got out at the first station
                  where the train stopped; and finding upon inquiry of the guard, that he must have
                  been left behind at Swindleham, she took the next train back that station, and
                  after a few further inquiries, had traced him to the Royal George Hotel.
               The next morning early they started for Little Mildhampton, where they safely
                  arrived about lunch time; receiving a welcome all the heartier for their
                  unexpected delay. Joseph had seen the folly of being too reserved and timid; and
                  warming up round the fire in the company of his Amelia, he told the story with
                  great glee—although the laugh  was often at his own expense—of how
                  narrowly he had escaped spending Christmas Eve in the cage at Swindleham; and the
                  difficulties he had contended with in his first attempt to carve a roast
                  goose.
            
            
               THE FAR-FAMED FAIRY TALE OF FENELLA.
               A FAMOUS Fish-Factor Found himself Father of Five Fine Flirting Females—Fanny,
                  Florence, Fernanda, Francesca, and Fenella. The First Four were Flat-Featured, ill-Favored,
                  Forbidding-Faced, Freckled Frumps, Fretful, Flippant, Foolish, and Flaunting.
                  Fenella was a Fine-Featured, Fresh, Fleet-Footed Fairy, Frank, Free, and Full of
                  Fun. The Fisher Failed, and was Forced by Fickle Fortune to Forego his Footman,
                  Forfeit his Forefathers' Fine Fields, Find a Forlorn Farm house in a Forsaken
                  Forest. The Four Fretful Females, Fond of Figuring at Feasts in Feathers and
                  Fashionable Finery, Fumed at their Fugitive Father. Forsaken by Fulsome,
                  Flattering, Fortune-hunters, who Followed them when Fish Flourished, Fenella
                  Fondled Father, Flavored their Food, Forgot her Flattering Followers, and
                  Frolicked in Frieze without Flounces. The Father Finding himself Forced to Forage
                  in Foreign parts For a Fortune, Found he could afford a Fairing to his Five
                  Fondlings. The First Four were Fain to Foster their Frivolity with Fine Frills and
                  Fans, Fit to Finish their Father's Finances; Fenella, Fearful of Flooring him,
                  Formed a Fancy For a Full Fresh Flower. Fate Favored the Fish-Factor For a Few
                  days, when he Fell in with a Fog, his Faithful 
                     Filley's
                     Filly's
                   Footsteps Faltered, and Food Failed. He Found himself in Front of a
                  Fortified Fortress. Finding it Forsaken, and Feeling himself Feeble and Forlorn
                  with Fasting, he Fed on the Fish, Flesh and Fowl he Found Fricaseed and Fried, and
                  when Full, Fell Flat on the Floor. Fresh in the Forenoon, he Forthwith Flew to the
                  Fruitful Fields, and not Forgetting Fenella, he Filched a Fair Flower; when a
                  Foul, Frightful, Fiendish Figure Flashed Forth, "Felonious Fellow! 
                     Finguring
                     Fingering
                   my Flower, I'll Finish you! Go, say Farewell to your Fine Felicitous
                  Family, and Face me in a Fortnight!" The Faint-hearted Fisher Fumed and Faltered,
                  and Fast was Far in his Flight. His Five daughters Flew to Fall at his Feet, and
                  Fervently Felicitate him. Frankly and Fluently he unfolded his Fate. Fenella
                  Forthwith, Fortified by Filial Fondness, Followed her Father's Footsteps, and
                  Flung her Faultless Form at the Foot of the Frightful Figure, who Forgave the
                  Father, and Fell Flat on his Face, For he had Fervently Fallen in a Fiery Fit of
                  love For the Fair Fenella. He Feasted and Fostered her till, Fascinated by his
                  Faithfulness, she Forgot the Ferocity of his Face, Form, and Feature, and Frankly
                  and Fondly Fixed Friday, Fifth of February, For the affair to come off. There were
                  present at the wedding Fanny, Florence, Fernanda, Francesca, and the Fisher. There
                  was Festivity, Fragrance, Finery, Fireworks, Fricaseed Frogs, Fritters, Fish,
                  Flesh, Fowl, and Furmenty, Frontignac, Flip, and Fare Fit For the Fastidious;
                  Fruit, Fuss, Flambeaux, Four Fat Fiddlers and Fifers; and the Frightful Form of
                  the Fortunate and Frumpish Fiend Fell from him, and he Fell at Fenella's Feet a
                  Fair-Favored, Fine, Frank, Freeman of the Forest. Behold the Fruits of Filial
                  affection!

               A TROUBLESOME SWAP.
               
                  
                  AT one of the bathing places on Long Island last summer, there was a
                  young couple who were engaged to be married; and one warm evening, when walking
                  along the beach, talking nonsense, they came to a beautiful cove, which was
                  divided by a rocky projection into two nice little bathing places. It was agreed
                  that they should bathe here, one taking the one place and the other the other, so
                  that they would be out of sight of each other. They went in, were having a first
                  rate time, splashing about and talking over the rock to each other, when a little
                  scamp, who had been fishing there, happened to see them, and straightway was
                  possessed by the devil to change their clothes. He did it, and the result is thus
                  related:
               As the boy ran behind a sandhill, his long shadow between her and the sinking sun
                  attracted the lady's notice, and in some trepidation she hastened to don her
                  apparel. Fancy her "feelinks" on finding, not her own clothes, but the hat, coat,
                  vest, and other articles, in extenso, of the
                  gentleman on the other side of the promontory! How could it have happened—and what
                  was to be done? Was that fearfully long shadow some spirit of the sea or shore,
                  who, offended at her intrusion upon his solitude, had resorted to this method of
                  punishing her temerity? It were better to imagine her situation than to attempt
                  describe it.
               In the meantime the gentleman, too, repaired to the shore to dress—Speechless
                  astonishment was depicted on his countenance, as it fell upon a heap of woman's
                  clothing. "What in thunder," he muttered to himself, "does this mean? Is the place
                  turned round, or am I crazy?" In the greatest perplexity he took up one article of
                  feminine apparel after another to the number of about thirty, letting one after
                  another drop again upon the rock where he stood, with many a half audible
                  ejaculation of wonder. There was no doubt in his mind as to whom the things
                  belonged, but how did they get there, and where were his own clothes? With one arm
                  akimbo, he pressed his other hand upon his forehead to collect his bewildered
                  sense, little thinking that the mischievous elf who was the author of his
                  embarrassment was laughing at him from behind the same sandhill.
               After a few moments of hesitation, the gentleman shouted to his lady love the
                  awkward intelligence, and in return was informed that his clothes lay at her feet.
                  All that was to be done was to exchange the lots; but how in the name of delicacy
                  was that consummation, so devoutly wished for, to be effected? The sun was now
                  down, but it was not dark yet. Finally, it was arranged that the lady should
                  venture into the water with her face seaward, while the lover should 
                  exchange the clothes and return to his side of the rocks. Unfortunately, just as
                  he was about to cut around the other side to perform the duty, he caught sight of
                  a couple of young ladies not far of, and he felt compelled to retreat
                  precipitately to his place again. His discomfited comfited companion would have then come out hastily
                  and called to the ladies for their help, but they were distant, and between
                  herself and them she saw a boy passing along.
               To cut the story short, the "peculiarly unpleasant predicament" lasted until the
                  young lady felt it necessary, to save herself from being chilled to death, to
                  attire herself in her lover's clothing.
               He, on his part, put her garments to the same use for his own benefit, and a
                  pretty good fit it was; for the two friends were about of a size, and but for the
                  discrepancy of a full beard, he might, in less dusky light than then prevailed,
                  have passed for a lady. It was his intention, in some way or other, he hardly knew
                  how, to rectify the matter immediately; but when he had ventured to join his
                  laughing and blushing sweetheart, he saw the mischievous boy a little distance
                  off, with a grin on his impish countenance, closely watching their motions.
                  Quickly putting a handkerchief to his face to conceal his tell-tale beard, the
                  gentleman took the lady's arm, and they sauntered on the shore until it was dark
                  then entered the hotel as privately as possible, and making the best of their way
                  to their respective rooms, lost no time in donning more appropriate
                  habiliments.

                  she knows will be sure to "write something nice in it."

                  bulldog who manifests the utmost interest in your progress, literally dogs your
                  every step, and by the intense expression of his countenance quite disarms you of
                  the thought of kicking him away.
               Lending your marked catalogue to a critic from the provinces, who has no more eye
                  for pictures than an oyster, and hearing him at dinner-time pass off half your
                  notes in the margin as his own.
               Being by nature of a rather swellish turn, and having to sacrifice yourself upon
                  the altar of affection, by going shopping with your wife and carrying home for her
                  a baby-jumper.
               
                  
               
               Being expected to sit easy in your chair while your prosy host is trying to unfold
                  the plot of your new comedy.
               
               Being driven to put up, after twenty miles of walking, at a hostelry devoted to
                  convivial custom; where, if you sit up, you are half chocked with rank tobacco;
                  and if you go to bed, the "Social Owls" or "Jolly Crabs" keep up such a singing in
                  your head, that the idea of sleep can nohow enter it.
               Enjoying (?) the repute of being "such a good-natured fellow," that everybody
                  fancies he may ask you to do anything, and never even thanks you when at any
                  sacrifice you've done it.
               Being of a slightly superstitious turn of mind, and when on your knees vowing
                  inextinguishable passion, hearing a vile German band begin to play "Love Not!"
               Because you are reputed a good judge of music, being asked by a fond mother to a
                  private morning concert, just to hear how nicely her dear Julia (aged six years
                  and a quarter) is progressing as a pianist.
               Lastly.—Sitting in the painfullest of postures to be photographed, and being most
                  especially entreated to "look natural!"
            
            
               FASHIONS IN FEET; OR, THE TALE OF THE BEAUTIFUL TO-TO.*
               
               
                  
                  *There is but little known of Shoo, the original author of this historical
                     romance, but that he wrote a poetical treatise on Boot-making, in measures
                     of two feet each. If any inference may be drawn from the title of his work,
                     he can have ventured but ankle-deep into the waters of the Sing-Slo, the
                     Chinese Castaly.
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Now beat the drum and clatter the gong,
                           And let us upraise our voices strong,
                           And tell it aloud with music and song,
                           What praise may well to our dames belong-
                           That they're sure to go right if they can't go wrong.
                        
                     
                     YA-HOO.
                  
               
               IF any of our lovely country-women should meet a Chinese lady, they would deem her
                  lot unblessed—at least, the first idea that would occur to them would be, that
                  they would not stand in her shoes.
               The Chinese ladies do not understand "long measure;" at all events their table is
                  peculiar, as they have but three inches to a foot. A curious fact in their anatomy
                  is, that their toes are bent, and twenty number, being doubled under
                  the sole; thus even though their feet move forward, their toes go backwards.
               They are extremely contentious; they cannot meet without scuffling. Their walk is
                  uneasy—they seem to move with pain; and how should it be otherwise when nails are
                  under their feet?
               Yet, though feet so diminutive are at present, and have been for many centuries
                  worn by the celestial ladies, this was not always the case. A French postillion
                  has been described as all boots: the sage Ya-hoo, whom we have quoted at the head
                  of this story, spoke of the softer sex in his time as all slippers;
                  yet it is true that even this expression seems to set them upon a bad footing.
               Their feet were not always so small. You shall find in Chinese histories that the
                  Emperor Min-Te, who came to the throne in the thirty-first year of the sixty-first
                  cycle, had a beautiful empress, To-To, whose feet in length rejoiced in their
                  complement of exactly twelve  inches. The Emperor loved his lady with
                  imperial measure of attachment; indeed he regarded her single self with more
                  affection than he entertained besides for
                  any two of his handmaidens; and he would seldom absent himself from her society
                  except when it was necessary for him to give audience—that is, to smoke a quiet
                  hooka in presence of his ministers—in the celestial council chamber. The custom of
                  the country rendered it impossible that To-To should attend him there; but when
                  the formal conference was over, he would frequently detain his favorite minister,
                  Hum, in whose character and wisdom he had great confidence, and retiring to a more
                  snug apartment, would invite his Empress to join them in a cosy pipe. On such
                  occasions state business was sometimes a second time discussed; and the decisions
                  of the lesser council often annulled and superseded those of the greater.
               Min-Te was a lazy monarch, and was well pleased to have all troublesome questions
                  of policy or justice arranged in a quiet manner without his intervention: he did
                  not like to be obliged to decide between the conflicting opinions of different
                  ministers; but in these agreeable little after-councils, strange to say, though a
                  lady was allowed a voice in them, there was always unanimity, and seldom a very
                  lavish expenditure of words. No wonder that Min-Te should value a minister whose
                  simple eloquence, and of course great argumentative powers, sufficed at once, upon
                  whatever subject they were exercised, to carry conviction even to an Empress. To
                  testify his great esteem for Hum, he ordered that he should be lodged in the
                  palace, in chambers not far distant from the imperial apartments. He frequently
                  employed him to instil into the lovely To-To a proper sense of all the duties she
                  should aim at fulfilling as a woman and a wife; but above all, as the chosen lady
                  of the Emperor.
               The beautiful Empress received meekly and graciously the lessons of virtue thus
                  imparted to her. Nothing, to her apprehension, could be more agreeable than the
                  counsels given by Hum. The Emperor, looking on at a little distance, was overjoyed
                  at seeing with how much attention she listened to the instructions of so excellent
                  an adviser; and when at other times he heard her discourse of virtue and the
                  duties of wifehood, "this is all Hum," thought he. Thus she gained still more of
                  his affection, and Hum of his esteem; and the fame of both went abroad throughout
                  all the celestial dominions. When Hum appeared in the streets the people flocked
                  about him. "A Hum! a Hum!" they cried, "the Emperor's favored counsellor! Three
                  cheers for a Hum!" Then they shouted aloud, and no sound could be heard except "A
                  Hum!"
               The Emperor was a sound sleeper; that is to say, he could sleep in spite of a
                  sound. It is strange that a sound sleeper and a quiet
                  sleep, should be nearly synonymous expressions; not quite, indeed, for one who
                  snores may be a sound sleeper. The Empress was a sound sleeper also; a very
                  determined sleeper; for she was addicted to somnambulism, and somnambulists must
                  be very determined sleepers.
               From being himself such a decided somnambulist, it was some time before the
                  Emperor became aware of his lady's peculiarity. A little whisper, however, no
                  bigger than a mosquito, which had for several days been fluttering about the
                  palace, and buzzing into people's ears, one morning came dancing about his; and
                  having awhile piped into it a very small voice, gave it a sting which caused
                  considerable irritation, then flew out of the window, and in a short time had
                  treated every mother's son,  and no less father's daughter throughout the
                  celestial dominions, in nearly the same way.
               That little provoking noise kept ringing in his imperial music-box, and the smart
                  continued, so that his majesty at night was quite unable to sleep; but, in the hope, no doubt, of bringing
                  the customary influence upon him, he lay quite still (by his lady's side), and
                  breathed hard, as though he had been in slumber.
               He fell, by-and-by, into a sort of half doze, a dreamy mood, in which the little
                  tune of the small whisper seemed to split into two parts; the one consisted of a
                  number of minikin figures made up of queer bars very strangely put together, which
                  kept dancing about his closed eyes the other still sounded in his ear, but its
                  members assumed an articulate character, and the sounds and the figures mutually
                  interpreted each other; whilst the tune was still discernible in the words, and
                  the motions of the characters kept time to it. This was the song:— 
                     
                        Min-Te, Min-Te, Min-Te,
                        Oh Emperor bold and free!
                        Do as bid,
                        Open your lid,
                        You'd better be wise and see.
                        With a chee, chee, chee, chee, chee, chee.*
                        
                        
                           
                           *I believe it is either Captain Marryat or Captain Basil Hall who
                              has given a specimen of the Mosquito language very closely
                              resembling this.
                        
                        Lest it betide (chee, chee,)
                        That your wife should creep (chee, chee,)
                        Away from your side (chee, chee,)
                        For she walks in her sleep (chee, chee).
                        With a chee, chee, chee, chee, cheeee, cheee, chee.
                        And a chee, chee, cheeee, cheee, cheee, chee, cheeeeeeee.
                        Min-Te, Min-Te, Min-Te,
                        Lend the loan of your lug to me;
                        I'd have you be wise,
                        And open your eyes,
                        And see what you shall see.
                        With a chee, chee, chee, chee, cheee, cheee, chee.
                        There's Hum in his bed (chee, chee,)
                        At the end of the gallery, (chee, chee,)
                        Best cut off his head, (chee, chee,)
                        Or at least his salary (chee).
                        With a cheee, chee, chee, chee, cheee, cheee, chee,
                        And a cheee, chee, chee, chee, cheee, cheee, cheeeeee.
                     
                   And so the song was proceeding, like the moon, all made of chee when his
                  imperial majesty (who lay dos-à-dos with his
                  wife, for the greater convenience of dozing a doze) was suddenly aroused to full
                  consciousness by a gentle pull of the silken coverlid. He lay quite quiet (though
                  a gnat at the moment settled on his nose), and soon perceived that the Empress was
                  getting out of bed in her sleep, and evidently taking the greatest possible care
                  not to awaken herself in so doing. Having no doubt at all—none whatever—not the
                  slightest in the world—not the least possible—that she was altogether unconscious
                  of what she was about, he thought, like a good Emperor, that it would be right she
                  should be looked to, lest she should break her neck down the stairs or out of the
                  window, the palace being two stories high; and, as he discovered that she moved
                  towards the door, he rose from bed as quiet as she had done, and followed; she all
                  the while treading as noiselessly as though she were a fly, and he as though he
                  were a spider.
               She proceeded along the gallery, and passed the stairs without accident; and she
                  had arrived almost at the bottom of the corridor, when the Emperor, alarmed lest
                  she should make a false step (a fox-paw as the French call it), seized her by
                  throwing his left arm round her waist; at the same time placing his right hand
                  over her mouth, to prevent that natural utterance of alarm which might be expected
                  from a lady suddenly awakened under such circumstances. Startled she was, and she
                  certainly would have screamed, had it not been for his precaution.
                  Being quite in the dark, both as to where she was, and as to who had laid such
                  violent hands upon her, you may imagine how greatly she was frightened. She
                  struggled to get loose, though still without making much noise; indeed she thought
                  that it would not be amiss if she could get back to her chamber as quietly as she
                  came thence. But this was not to be; for the prime minister Hum, who, with what
                  truth I cannot pretend to say, had the reputation of being at all times wide
                  awake, was not asleep upon the present occasion; and hearing, with his pair of
                  very acute ears, a little scuffling in the gallery, he opened the door of his
                  apartment, which was close to the scene of action. He had apparently been deeply
                  engaged in study, for he held in his hand a lighted lantern, the light of which he
                  now directed upon the pair in the corridor. The instant he saw them, however, it
                  dropped from his hand; and closing and fastening the door with all possible
                  celerity, he jumped upon his bed, coiled himself into a circle less than his waist
                  in diameter, drew the clothes over him in a heap, and lay without moving,
                  breathing, or letting his beard grow, till the morning light had filled his
                  apartment.
               During the moment that a gleam from the lantern had been thrown upon them, To-To became aware that it was only the
                  Emperor who had frightened her so much in the dark; and of course, much delighted
                  at this discovery, and her fears all banished thereby, she immediately returned to
                  the imperial apartment.
               "My dearest To-To," said his imperial majesty as they entered, "I was not till now
                  aware that you were a somnambulist. Why did you never mention to me that you were
                  so afflicted? I would have had a gold collar made to surround your ankle, and a
                  chain and lock to secure you to the bed. I myself would have kept the key, so
                  dearly do I tender your safety."
               "I had hoped," she replied, "that my attachment to your sacred majesty would
                  always have exercised the counteracting influence which it has hitherto done, and
                  have overcome entirely the infirmity to which I was formerly subject. I have no
                  fear of another attack, and I think the gold chain therefore will be quite
                  unnecessary."
               "As, however, you are restless to-night," said the Emperor, "I will secure you for
                  the present with this strap. Stay, let me pass it round you. There, that will
                  do—nay, one pull more—uh, uh—you can't move now, I think. That's just the
                  thing—the lock is famous—so—and here goes the key. Don't be afraid; you can't roll
                  down. And now, as I am rather of the sleepiest, good night, dearest madam. Indeed
                  this sleep-walking is a terrible thing; but we'll say no more about that till the
                  morning."
               He had scarcely finished speaking before he was fast asleep; but poor To-To could
                  not get to sleep at all, for she was almost cut in two by the strap he had
                  fastened round her.
               In the morning the Emperor liberated his wife; but he did not revert to the
                  subject of sleep-walking till after he had finished his morning devotions and
                  meal.
               He sent for her then; and when she came into his presence he asked if she
                  remembered the circumstances of the preceding night. She confessed that she had
                  some confused recollection of a dream, in which she had imagined that, after her
                  beloved lord had been a long time absent from her, whilst pining for his return,
                  she suddenly beheld him walking towards her, at a distance, in the garden; and
                  that in the affection of her heart she had gone forth to meet him, and to welcome
                  him home. She was, accordingly, hastening down the long walk, when a black dragon
                  flew out of the canal by which it was bordered, and coiled suddenly around her.
                  That she was mortally frightened thereat, and, with the greatest presence of mind,
                  resolved on the instant to utter a loud scream; but that the black dragon put one
                  of its terrible paws upon her mouth, and prevented this. On partially awakening
                  about that time, what was her satisfaction at discovering that the black dragon
                  was no other than the Emperor himself.
               Her compassionate lord endeavored to console her with the suggestion that some
                  remedy might possibly be found for this unfortunate habit; and he questioned her
                  as to whether there was any manner which she could at all account for her being
                  thus afflicted. In answer to this, she expressed a suspicion that her mamma had
                  been partly concerned; and she told some long story to substantiate this view: but
                  that I consider little worthy our attention, as she made the facts a few weeks
                  older than herself, and might therefore be supposed to know but little of the
                  matter. She afterwards, however, put the thing in a more philosophical light, when
                  she said, that her habits being sedentary and her feet large, the latter, she
                  thought, had not a proper proportion exercise during the day; and thus made up
                  secretly for the deficiency at night, when they knew that she was sleeping, and
                  unable consequently to keep a look out upon their motions.
               Now here let it be mentioned that large feet in the days of Min-Te were as
                  necessary to the ideal of female loveliness throughout the celestial dominions, as
                  small feet have been ever since; and that Min-Te himself had chosen the delectable
                  To-To as the wife of his bosom, chiefly on account of her felicities in that
                  department of the beautiful. Nevertheless, when his lady declared her conviction
                  with premeditation that those her lovely members walked away with her in such an
                  inexcusable manner, he could not restrain himself from uttering a malediction
                  against them. This malediction was expressed in three words; but the nib of my pen
                  turns this way and that, and refuses to write the first: "their soles" were the
                  other two.
               Min-Te then informed his lady that it had come to his knowledge that, though he
                  doubted not she was quite unconscious of the fact, the little excursion she had
                  taken the past night was by no means the first she had made in the same direction;
                  and he considered that if she walked at all, that was the wrong way, and this he
                  disapproved in To-To.
               But To-To expressed great satisfaction at hearing this, as she said that actions
                  done in sleep always went by a rule of contrary, and that her walking the wrong
                  way in a dream, was the most lucid of all possible proofs that her ways were
                  always correct in her waking hours.
               Could the Emperor do otherwise than bow to the force of such argument? He highly
                  applauded his lady, and assured her of his perfect confidence in her waking
                  excellence. Yet he confessed that his strong conviction of this was in itself a source of
                  disquiet to his mind; for she had clearly demonstrated that it would be the
                  occasion of her always going wrong in sleep. It was his wish, if possible, that
                  this might be avoided; and the only mode which occurred to him of escaping from
                  the dilemma, was to prevent her from going at all. How to effect this? He wished
                  heartily that her feet had not grown since infancy, as she then would not have
                  taken to sleep-walking; but they had, and what was to be done; Min-Te
                  was an inventive genius; he hit upon an admirable plan: he sent for a cook and a
                  cleaver, and had the offending members chopped six inches shorter. The cure was
                  complete; it is confidently stated that To-To never more walked in her sleep; and
                  I recommend all somnambulists to try the efficiency of Min-Te's invention.
               The Emperor next wished a private conference with his prime minister. Hum had not
                  yet arisen, and the messengers had to seek him his chamber. They found him nearly
                  in the attitude in which he lay when we wished him good night; but when they
                  endeavored to arouse him, they discovered that he had choked himself by swallow
                  his pigtail.
               A proclamation went abroad throughout the empire, that the most honored and
                  exemplary Empress, the lantern of beauty and steel-yard of ceremony, had set the
                  fashion of short feet; and though it was not absolutely required that all the
                  ladies of the land should conform to this mode,
                  it was made imperative on all parents to wrap up the feet of their female children
                  in such ligatures of cotton, silk, leather, or brass, as should effectually
                  prevent the future growth of the pedal bones and ligaments, the toes being bent
                  inwards towards the sole; "for," said the edict, "as the toes of women have a
                  natural bias to go wrong, it is proper that they should be turned the opposite
                  way."
               The name of the Empress—To-To, signifying "Long-Foot,"—had become inapplicable;
                  nor could it be desirable for an imperial lady when length of foot had ceased to
                  be among the elements of female beauty: the Emperor therefore changed it to
                  Fo-Paw, which may be Englished as "One who walks the wrong way."
               Min-Te and Fo-Paw thenceforth lived ever happily.*
                   The wisdom of Min-Te is much spoken of in this day, and he is accounted
                  one of the greatest benefactors of his country; for the Chinese are of opinion
                  that their wives have walked much more steadily since they lost the use of their
                  feet.
               
                  
                  *This is perhaps the less remarkable, as the whole reign of the Ten-Thousand
                     Years—such is one of the titles of the Emperors of China—did not extend
                     beyond twelve calendar months.

                  INTRODUCTION.
                  "THE Tea-Tree," of Tee-to-tum, is the most celebrated of all Chinese didactic
                     poems, and is one of those great and elaborate works to production of which the
                     labor of a life is necessary. The story of Hyson and Bohea, of which the
                     following must be looked upon as somewhat a free translation, may be considered
                     as perhaps the most pathetic of its episodes.
                  Tee-to-Tum did not misemploy his genius, and his toil was not ill rewarded; for
                     "The Tea-Tree" may be considered the great national poem of the Chinese.
                  The history of Tee-to-Tum is somewhat remarkable. It is related that he was
                     cradled in a tea-chest, and that tea not only formed his earliest diet, but
                     that through life he took no other nourishment. He lived in a retired
                     tea-garden in the district of Sing-Te; his house and furniture were formed of
                     tea-wood, and the dry branches of tea-trees served him as fuel. He lived to a
                     green old age, and his death was occasioned by an accident similar to that
                     which terminated the days of Anacreon, only that the Chinese poet was choked,
                     not by a grape-stone, but a tea-stalk.
                  His poem is very voluminous, being divided into two hundred books, or, as he
                     calls them, branches. Each branch comprises full a thousand "leaves;" not
                     indeed leaves of two pages each; but the single verses of Tee-to-Tum are called
                     "tea-leaves" by the people the Celestial Land. His industry was remarkable not
                     a day passed without his adding to or correcting his poem.
                  
                     "TE veniente die, TE decedente canebat."
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     POUR forth, O Muse!*
                         thine influence let me win!
                     O let me draw thee! let me drink thee in!
                     Warm thou my tongue with spirit clear and strong,
                     And from thy kettle breathe the steam of song:
                     Gently uplift thy dewy lid and see
                     The fancied forms of Hyson and Bohea;
                     Imbue my lips their mournful fates to tell,
                     Whilst flow hot streams for two that loved so well.
                  
                  
                     
                     *The Muse of Tea, whom the poet invokes at intervals throughout his
                        poem, and whom we have invoked at the commencement of this volume
                  
                  
                     Love, wondrous smith! who fashions chains from looks,
                     And from mere eyes can form both eyes and hooks,
                     Had linked their hearts the hour that first they met,
                     Had linked their hearts with links that bound them yet.
                     In lonely glen their constant love began,
                     And, first by chance, oft since they met by plan.
                  
                  
                     
                  
                  
                     Oh, happy the youth (for him Fortune, in truth,
                     Hath a white page without any blot,)
                     To whom it occurs that his pigtail with hers
                     Shall be tied in a true lovers knot.
                  
                  
                     And none in all the province could compare
                     With the sleek Hyson, or Bohea the fair.
                     Both born and bred away from city's scenes,
                     Though town-bred youth might call young Hyson green,
                     Though town-bred dames with scornful eyes might see,
                     And dub his country love, "poor, weak, Bohea,"
                     Enough for them the charms within their reach,
                     Enough for them that each was loved by each.
                  
                  
                     Yet 'neath some evil star their love arose:
                     Though they were dearest friends their sires were foes,
                     The cause of their dear friendship is not hidden—
                     Both young, both comely, and their love forbidden:
                     The cause their sires were foes is still more plain—
                     Both had one trade, and both lived in one lane.
                     One village lane some ly from Nanking's walling;
                     And manufacturing porcelain was their calling:
                     Both shone in that like two superior stars,
                     And so between them they had many jars.
                  
                  
                     Old age and youth!—oh! that is formed for
                        strife,
                     This—this for love, the bird's-nest soup of life!
                     And should the truth before those sires be set,
                     How well their children loved, how oft they met,
                     Not locusts, dragons, Tartars could compare
                     With the fierce wrath of that grey-pigtailed pair.
                  
                  
                     But with a cautious care the maid and spark
                     Deceived their sires, and kept them in the dark;
                     Made assignations with a code of signs;
                     Oft met by moonlight among groves and vines.
                  
                  
                     The days pass'd on,—the nights flew likewise by;—
                     Weeks past, and months: and still they met to sigh
                     And dream of bliss. Young Hyson! fond Bohea!
                     In vain ye dream of bliss that must not be.
                  
                  
                     One night,—that gloomy night no bat would flit
                     But crows around flew late and oft alit,
                     And winds breathed loud in melancholy wail,—
                     A treacherous friend had told their tender tale.
                     
                     A treacherous friend, to whom Bohea confessed
                     With too fond trust the secrets of her breast,—
                     Though bound to silence by the holiest oath,
                     That friend, too treacherous, had betrayed them both;
                     Told more, much more than need the muse repeat,
                     And when they met, and where they next should meet.
                     Bohea had told her all, and told her true:
                     Bohea knew not that friend loved Hyson too.
                  
                  
                     Unwise Bohea! your error now is learn'd;
                     Too soon committed, and too late discern'd;
                     Too soon you trusted, and too late you vex;
                     Yet not in you the fault, but in your sex.
                     Each fair one of some secret thus possest,
                     Whilst all the change is hers, can take no rest;
                     So, prizing it more deeply than her peepers,
                     To make it safer, finds it several keepers.
                  
                  
                     That night, that gloomy night, that night of mist,
                     Bohea and Hyson sought their place of tryst:
                     Bowered with green leaves, and far from haunts of men,
                     That place of tryst was no trist place till then.
                  
                  
                     They rushed to meet,—they almost met; delight
                     Was in their looks. How was't they met not quite?
                     What was't that check'd their speed at once and joy,
                     And made them pause,—that maiden and her boy?
                  
                  
                     For such effect cause strong and good was there:
                     One hand had grasped Bohea by her long hair,
                     And kept her from her love,—the fond, the true:
                     And one stern fist held Hyson by the queue.
                     Their bliss was balk'd, their hearts were filled with doubt,
                     Their heads were hurt, and both shriek'd loudly out!
                  
                  
                     Yes, 'twas their sires: their sires had heard their tale
                     From that false friend,—and both with rage turn'd pale:
                     But both resolved to learn the story's truth,
                     Ere one condemned the maid, or one the youth.
                     With this intent they both had sought that spot:
                     Oh, fair Bohea's and Hyson's evil lot!
                  
                  
                     Just ere they met,—alas, too faithful pair!
                     Those two sprang forth, and seized them by the hair.
                     By her's Bohea's stern father dragged her home,
                     And question'd, as they went, how dared she roam
                     To meet young sparks by moonlight in a glen,
                     And why that youth, of all the race of men?
                     Arrived at home, he tied her to a post
                     By those sweet locks young Hyson prized the most
                     Removed her scissors from the unhappy fair,
                     And bound her hands, lest these unbind her hair,
                     Withheld her rice and pipe, and barred the door,
                     Until she vow'd she ne'er would do so more.
                  
                  
                     And Hyson's father let not him go free,
                     But brought him home, and strapp'd him to a tree
                     
                        
                     
                     By his long queue,—ah me, that it would moult!
                     For, fasten'd by that lock, he could not bolt.
                     
                     Then as a thresher whirls round in a trice
                     The ponderous flail and thrashes out the rice,
                     So, whirling round his head a stout bamboo,
                     He thrash'd his son: his son who dared to woo.
                     The youth, when 'gainst his ears he felt the cane,
                     (Against his ears was much against the grain,)
                     Shriek'd out an oath he'd never do't again.
                  
                  
                     That self-same night, when all were lock'd in sleep,
                     The sad Bohea, who stay'd awake to weep,
                     Rose from her couch, and lest her shoes might klop,
                     "Padded the hoof" and sought her father's shop.
                     High in the midst a tea-pot huge was placed,
                     Of finest porcelain and superior taste;
                     In forming which it was her sire's fond aim
                     To win at once more custom and more fame.
                     So water-pots, and boots of giant size
                     Oft hang from shops to attract the passers' eyes.
                     To turn it to some use, besides mere show,
                     Just at this time he made it a depôt
                     For certain tea, some four-and-twenty-lbs.
                     Dried by himself—the produce of his grounds.
                     There came Bohea, the beautiful! the sweet!
                     And standing on the tips of her small feet,
                     Scarce knowing what to do or how begin,—
                     She lifted up the cover, and look'd in.
                  
                  
                     Then went she thence,—she was her father's daughter,—
                     And, one by one, fetch'd several pails of water,
                     And emptied in;—but slow the liquid rose,
                     And soon she brought this labor to a close.
                     "Oh! vain," she cried, "with destiny to cope!
                     This tea-pot, too, was formed to balk my hope.
                     At such a rate as this, oh, Fortune's spite!
                     I scarce should fill it should I toil all night.
                     I hoped in this to bid my sorrows flee;
                     But fate forbids. Unfortunate Bohea!"
                  
                  
                     She clasp'd her fair hands like some stage adept,
                     Lean'd on the porcelain, raised her eyes and wept.
                     The tears went down her cheeks in such array
                     As floods roll down when river-banks give way.
                     Oh! joy, Bohea! thy woes shall find their bar:
                     Those tears in quick streams gush'd into the jar;
                     So hot they fell, so large, and fast, and free,
                     They fill'd the porcelain pot,—and made the tea.
                     "Is't true?" she cried. "Then Fo hath heard my prayer—
                     Come back, sweet Hope! and hence, far hence, Despair!
                     If but my act shall prompt the youth I love,
                     Though parted here, we soon may meet above.
                     So now of friends and foes I take my leave,
                     And drown myself to make my father grieve."
                  
                  
                     She climb'd a chair beside the tea-pot's brim;
                     She plunged—she sank—alas! she could not swim.
                     White gleam'd her robes amid the watery gleam—
                     The steam arose—her breath rose with the steam.
                     No corks were there, no bladders, and no stick;
                     Three times she kick'd, and then she ceased to kick:
                     Strong was the tea-pot, and in vain she struck it,
                     And her last kick kick'd that, and kick'd the bucket.
                     As leaves of tea, long twisted and curl'd up,
                     Swell and unrol in tea-pot or in cup,—
                     Though downward bent her toes had long perforce lain,
                     She turn'd them up in that sad piece of porcelain.
                  
                  
                     Perchance this tale improbable appears;
                     Yet think how often maids are drown'd in tears,
                     Then deem it true, and weep for poor Bohea,—
                     First drown'd in tears,—then both in tears and tea
                  
                  
                     Young Hyson heard—for ill news travel fast—
                     Young Hyson heard—young Hyson stood aghast.
                     He swore, he raved, he stamped, he tore his hair,—
                     That one long lock,—he scream'd,—he cursed the chair
                     That help'd her up,—he cursed his evil lot—
                     He curs'd the tea, he also cursed its pot.
                     He strove to weep,—but strove to weep in vain,—
                     There seem'd to glow hot lava in his brain,
                     Volcano fires before his eyes to start,
                     And more than earthquake to convulse his heart.
                     He strove to speak—but, oh! no voice would come;
                     He strove again—his words were, "Ha" and "Hum."
                     
                     Once more he strove;—at last the fetters broke
                     That bound his speech,—he strove to speak,—and spoke:—
                  
                  
                     
                  
                  
                     "Oh! thou white lump of sugar!*
                         thrown too soon
                     To sweeten tea—(ah! would I were thy spoon)!—
                     Thou for whose sake my grief must ever keep hot,
                     Why didst thou fall in that detested tea-pot?
                     Alas! no power may bring her back to life,
                     Who was my love, who should have been my wife—
                     Away with words, with life—in brief, with breath—
                     Nought now is left worth living for, save death!
                     Though foes should gladden, and though friends should weep,
                     If fires be hot, knives sharp, or opium cheap,
                     If wolves be fierce, wells deep, or girdles strong
                     Then farewell, life!—thou shalt not hold me long."
                  
                  
                     
                     *This metaphorical apostrophe, which occurs in the original of
                        Tee-to-Tum, is the more remarkable, as the Chinese are not in the
                        habit of taking sugar in their tea.
                  
                  
                     Thus spoke the youth: then rose from where he sat
                     And rush'd away—the wind bore off his hat,—
                     He heeded not—he rush'd, and on the wind
                     His clothes flew out, his pigtail streamed behind:—
                     
                        
                     
                     Long, black, and fluttering with his speed it stream'd,
                     And head and pigtail some huge tadpole seem'd,
                     Or comet grim, dread portent of the skies,
                     Its tail the pigtail, and its light his eyes.
                  
                  
                     Thus on he flew, and did not turn, or stop,
                     Or pause, till lo! he reach'd a blacksmith's shop—
                  
                  
                     There check'd his steps.—"Hillo!" but no reply—
                     "What, hoa! who waits?"—his loud voice rent the sky.
                     Dread silence follow'd,—and his bold heart sunk.
                     "Sure those within must be asleep or drunk."
                     He first peep'd in,—then enter'd—but could find
                     None, save one old man, almost deaf and blind.
                     "Father!" he cried;—the old man answered "Son!"—
                     "Have you an axe?"—the sage replied, "Here's one."—
                     "The price?" he asked.—"Three mace."—"I'll give you two."
                     —"Enough." He seized it, paid, and on he flew.
                  
                  
                     Not far from thence—from thence it might be seen—
                     There grew a tea-tree, of the sort called green;
                     
                     To that he bent his flight, and there he found
                     One branch that grew breast-high above the ground.
                     He cut it midway through—part fell down flump,
                     And part was left outstanding from the stump.
                     The first he dragg'd away, and threw aside;
                     The last he sharpen'd with the tool: then cried,
                     "Oh! worst of all plant-kind! malignant tea!
                     Since my sweet girl, my all beloved Bohea,
                     For whom have I such bitter cause to grieve,
                     Amid thy lifeless leaves of life took leave;
                     What better course could be, what wiser plan
                     Devised for me—oh! most unhappy man!
                     To leave a world of which my soul is sick,
                     Than on thy stick thus cut, to cut my stick!"
                  
                  
                     He said, and moving some few paces back
                     To gain a run, he made his girdle slack,
                     And bared his breast:—then raising to the skies
                     His hands, he oped his mouth, and closed his eyes,
                     Breathed out one last sigh for his love's sweet sake,
                     Cried, "Oh Bohea!" and rush'd upon the stake.
                     The stake went through between his lights and liver
                     He gave four kicks, two screeches, and one quiver—
                     He felt the sharp wood in his vital parts,
                     And in that quiver seem'd ten thousand darts.
                     "Oh Fo!" he cried, or ere his eyes grew dim—
                     "Oh Fo!" he cried, and Fo gave ear to him—
                     "Oh Fo!" he cried, "be not a foe to me,
                     But draw me hence, yet, yet my love to see.
                     Since early death thus bliss on earth denies,
                     Oh! let us meet and mingle in the skies.
                     And though our parents' hearts have yet been hard,
                     Whence our fond hearts were each from each debarr'd,
                     Grant that they now may sorrow o'er our doom,
                     And lay our bones together in one tomb,
                     And write our tale, that all our fates may know!"
                     This said, young Hyson was absorb'd in Fo.
                  
                  
                     Her parents in the tea-pot found Bohea—
                     They drew the body thence, and saved the tea,
                     Rich store, in well-cork'd jars, for livelong weeks.
                     But tears meanwhile bedew'd their tender cheeks;
                     And much they wish'd, when every wish was vain,
                     They ne'er had parted that most faithful twain.
                     And Hyson's parents found him on the stake—
                     A sight to make their fond hearts yearn and ache;—
                     Hung up, ah me! in every breeze to spin,
                     Like windmill's sails, or chafers on a pin.
                     They moved from thence—they laid him in a shell—
                     They learn'd the fate of her he loved so well.
                     They, too, at last relented—but too late;
                     And feeling guilty, threw the blame on fate.
                  
                  
                     Then well-writ notes and courteous messages
                     Pass'd between Hyson's father and Bohea's.
                     Old feuds forgot, they clear'd their brows of gloom,
                     And both subscribed to build one common tomb,
                     Even on that spot where met those thralls of love.
                     One half beneath the ground, and half above
                     Of tea-pot shape 'twas built, but partly hid,
                     And the roof fashion'd like a tea-pot lid.
                     The whole when lined with finest porcelain clay,
                     There, in two chests, Bohea and Hyson lay.
                     A plant of tea was set on either side;
                     This green—the sort on which young Hyson died;
                     That black—a kind since far and wide renown'd,
                     In whose infusion fair Bohea was drown'd.
                     The plants grew well, and, rich in leaf and bloom,
                     The branches mingled o'er the lovers' tomb:
                     Whence those two species, from those days to these.
                     Have borne the names of Hysons and Boheas.
                     Still maids and lovers to that tomb repair
                     To plight the vows of fond affection there;
                     Kneel by the grave, or lift their hands above
                     To pluck the sprigs as talismans of love;
                     And gentle brides, their husbands' hearts to fix,
                     Of those two kinds the cup of union mix.
                     Ne'er had the fond pair known that state divine,
                     "Where transport and security entwine;"
                     But since kind Death had tied them in one tether,
                     Their namesake leaves full oft are brought together.
                     In equal chests (with India-paper linings),
                     In transports, with security to Twinings.
                  
                  
                  
                     Then weep no more for that united pair,
                     Since thus in death one common lot they share;
                     And, like their trees that high in air embrace,
                     Fo bade their spirits rise from that low place
                     To meet above; and Hyson and Bohea
                     Now mix their essence both in Tien*
                         and tea.

                  FATHERS of the Oratory,
                  Listen to my surprising tale,
                  Harken to a wonderous story
                  More than very like a whale;
                  Each mesmeric marvel-monger,
                  Lend to me your ears likewise;
                  If for miracles you hunger,
                  You shall ope both mouth and eyes.
               
               
                  In the ship Ann Alexander,
                  Cruising in pursuit of whales,
                  Bold JOHN S. DEBLOIS, Commander,
                  With a crew so gallant, sails.
                  In the South Pacific Ocean,
                  Reaching to the Off Shore Ground,
                  'Mong the waves in wild commotion,
                  Several monstrous Whales they found.
               
               
                  These two boats did follow after,
                  Larboard boat, and starboard too,
                  And with shouts of glee and laughter,
                  The Leviathans pursue;
                  When the larboard boat commanded
                  By the stout First Mate, did soon
                  In a Whale, with force strong-handed,
                  Deeply plunge a sharp harpoon.
               
               
                  Off the mighty monster started;
                  Pain and anguish gave him cause;
                  Suddenly he backwards darted,
                  Seized the boat between his jaws;
                  Into smithereens he cracked it;
                  Or, as witnesses declare,
                  Who beheld the thing transacted,
                  Bits no bigger than a chair!
               
               
                  In the starboard boat, the Captain
                  Quickly to the rescue struck,
                  And, although the bark was snapt in
                  Pieces, saved the crew—by luck.
                  Now the good Ann Alexander
                  
                  To their aid the waist-boat sent;
                  Half the band then having manned her,
                  At the Whale again they went.
               
               
               
                  Soon the ocean-giant nearing,
                  They prepared to give him fight,
                  Little-thinking, never fearing,
                  That the beast again would bite.
                  
                     
                  
                  But without their host they reckon'd;
                  At their boat he also flew;
                  Like the first he served the second,
                  Snapped it into pieces too.
               
               
                  Sure his jaws, together clapping,
                  Had the gallant seamen crushed;
                  But, when they perceived him snapping,
                  Straight into the sea they rushed.
                  To afford the help they needed,
                  Bold DEBLOIS repaired again,
                  Once more, also, he succeeded,
                  In the aim to save his men.
               
               
                  Tired, perhaps, of sports renewing,
                  To the ship this time they hied,
                  When, behold, the Whale pursuing,
                  With his jaws extended wide.
                  Gloating with revenge, he sought 'em;
                  But with blubber pierced, and gored,
                  He was crippled, or had caught 'em;
                  But they all got safe on board.
               
               
                  Risk the heroes little cared for;
                  Speedily they set their sail
                  In the ship herself—prepared for
                  One more tussle with the Whale.
                  Now they reach'd him—plunged a lance in
                  The infuriate monster's head;
                  Then—of course they had no chance in
                  Close encounter—onward sped.
               
               
                  For the ship they saw him making,
                  But the chase he soon gave o'er,
                  Which the animal forsaking,
                  Down on him again they bore;
                  Fifty rods below the water
                  There they saw the monster lie;
                  So, despairing him to slaughter,
                  They resolved no more to try.
               
               
                  At this time, DEBLOIS was standing
                  Sternly on the larboard bow,
                  Ready, with harpoon in hand,
                  To inflict a deadly blow:
                  Up he saw the monster rising,
                  With velocity and power,
                  At the rate of speed surprising,
                  Of full fifteen knots an hour!
               
               
               
                  In an instant—Heaven defend us!—
                  Lo, the Whale had, near the keel
                  Struck, with such a force tremendous,
                  That it made the vessel reel;
                  And her bottom knock'd a hole in,
                  Into which the water pour'd;
                  And the sea so fierce did roll in,
                  That the billows rush'd and roar'd.
               
               
                  Yet the ship was saved from sinking,
                  Though so riddled by the Whale,
                  And DEBLOIS and his unshrinking
                  Crew, survive to tell the tale.
                  
                     
                  
                  Strong are all those daring fellows,
                  Doubtless, the harpoon to throw:
                  And—to judge from what they tell us—
                  Stronger still to draw thy bow!
               
            
            
               THE "OLD SALT" AMONG THE MERMAIDS.
               A YARN, BY A CAPE CODDER.
               
                  
               
               Do I b'leve in the sea-sarpint? You might as well ax me if I b'leved in the
                  compass, or thought the log could lie. I've never seed the critter myself, cos I
                  haint cruised in them waters as he locates himself in, not since I started on my
                  first voyage in the Confidence whaler Capting Coffing; but I recking
                  I've got a brother as hails from Nahant, that sees him handsome every year, and knows the latitude and longitude of the
                  beast just as well as I knows the length o' the futtock shrouds o' the
                  foretops.
               Brother Zac's pretty cute, and kalkilates from actil observation how much the
                  sarpint grows every year; and then he gets siferin', and figgerin', and reckonin',
                  till he makes out how tarnal long it took the sarpint to extensity himself to that
                  almighty size—offerin' to prove that the critter was one o' them ar' creeping,
                  things what the first Commodore took into his boat at that ar' big rain as the
                  parsons tell on; and perhaps, as Zac says, he is the real, original, etarnal
                  sarpint, as got the weather-gage of our first mother, and gammoned her to lay
                  piratical hands on her husband's stock of apples, jest as he was getting' his
                  cider fixins ready in the fall. And, by gauly, old fellers, their ain't nothin'
                  agin natur in that yarn, nyther—for brother Zac says, he can prove that that ar'
                  sarpint must have partaking o' the tree o' life as growed in the garding of Eding,
                  afore them first squatters what had located themselves thar' was druv' off for
                  makin' free with the governor's trees. Well, there was a nigger as I knowed once,
                  down south, 'mongst them cotting plantashings—and this here darky used to get his
                  rum aboard rather stiff—so, one night, havin' stowed away a soakin' cargo, he
                  found the navigation pretty considerable severe, and after tackin' larboard and
                  starboard, makin' short legs to winderd, and long uns to lewerd, he missed stays,
                  and brought up in a ditch. While the darkey was lettin' off the steam, and snorin'
                  himself sober, a mud dortle, about the size of our capting's epilletts, crawls
                  right slick into his open mouth, and wriggles stret down into his innerds. Waell,
                  the nigger felt the effects of too much tortle to his dying day; and that's the
                  case, I guess, with the sarpint—for, havin' fed in his infancy on the fruit o' the
                  tree o' life, he was obligated to keep on livin' ever arter, and can't die no how
                  he can fix it. And so he keeps on gettin' longer every week, like a purser's
                  account, and nobody can't guess what for, nyther.
               Did you ever see a marmaid? Waell, then, I reckon you'd best shut up,
                  cos I have—and many on 'em; and marmen, too, and marmisses and
                  marmasters, of all sizes, from babbies not bigger nor mackrels, to regular
                  six-feeters, with starns like a full-grow'd porpus. I've been at a marmaid's
                  tea-party, and, after larnin' the poor ignorant scaly critters how to splice the
                  main brace, I left the hull bilin' on 'em blazin' drunk.
               You see, when our craft was cruisin' up the Arches, we cast anchor, one mornin',
                  in pretty deep water, jest abrest of a small green island as wasn't down in the
                  chart, and hadn't got no name, nyther. But our capting know'd what he was arter,
                  abeout as right as ninepence, cos a small skewner came alongside pretty sune,
                  freighted with brandy and wine for the officers, what they'd ordered for their own
                  private stores. Waell, the slings was run up to the end o' the main-yard, and the
                  waisters were busy hoistin' up the barrils, when a cask o' brandy slipped from the
                  slings as it was being canted round, and dropped right splash into the sea,
                  sinkin' right away. Upon 'zaminationing the manifest, it proved to be the best
                  cask o' brandy in the skewner, imported from Boardo, direct, for the capting
                  himsel. He raised a gretty muss, I guess, right off the reel. "You eternal lazy
                  suckers," said he; "look here! take all the boats' anchors, lash 'em together in
                  tews, so as to form grapnels o' four pints each, and drag all about here for that
                  ar' brandy—and mind you find it, or I'll put every mother's son of you on short
                  allowance o' rye for the next month."
               Waell, the boats was ordered out, and a gropin' we went. I was placed in the
                  jolly, with Sy Davis and Pete Slinks, and a middy to direct. The middy was a
                  pretty considerable smart fellow, and jest as we was puttin' off, he nodded up to
                  the chaplin, as was leanin' over the side, and says:—"What say you to an hour's
                  float upon this here glassy sea?" The parson was down by the man-ropes in a
                  minnit, and off we sot, a fishin' for the brandy tub.
               The current run pretty slick by the side of the little island, and the second
                  luff, who was in the cutter, ordered us to go ahead, and watch along the shore,
                  jest to see if the tub warn't rolled up there by the tide. We pretended to look
                  right hard for the tub, till we made the lee o' the island, and then, if we didn't
                  resolve to take it easy, and run the noose o' the jolly into the yaller sand o'
                  the shore, there ain't no snakes. I held on, in the starn, by the grapnel, and the
                  parson pulled out of his pocket a good-sized sample bottle o' the new stuff as
                  he'd jest bought, and wanted the middy to taste; and, arter passin' their ideas on
                  the licker, the chaplin gave us men a pretty stiff horn apiece, now I tell you,
                  and first-rate stuff it was, I swow. It iled the parson's tongue, like all
                  out-doors; it took him to talk, all abeout the old original anteek names o' the
                  islands that laid in spots all about thar'—classic ground, as he called it, and a
                  pretty yarn he did spin, tew. He talked about the island of Candy, whar' the
                  sweetest galls was in all creation, or anywhar' else; and of a great chief, called
                  Beau Lasses, or Molasses, who, killed a one-eyed giant of a blacksmith, named
                  Polly Famous, by spitting in his eye; and about a fireman, named Henearus, who
                  carried out an old man, one Ann Kysiss, on his shoulders, when his house was
                  a-fire; for you see, many o' them old Grecian men had wimming's names, and wisely
                  warsey, tew. But what took my cheese, was the parson's tellin' us abeout tew fellows, as got up
                  the biggest chunk of a fight, and kept right at it for ten years, stret out, and
                  all abeout a gall, named Ellen, what skeeted from her moorings, and run off to
                  Paris. Then the parson tried to pint out the island of Lip-salve, where a
                  she-conjuror, called Sarcy, from her boldness, used to keep a hull skeul of
                  singin' galls, called syringes, cos they sucked the sailors ashore, and then
                  chawed them right up, like a piece of sweet Cavendish. Then, the middy, who'd been
                  keepin' dark, and layin' low, all this time, show'd his broughtens-up, and let fly
                  a hull broadside at the parson, about them ar' syringes and other fabblus wimming;
                  such as King Nepching's wife, Ann Thracite, and her she Try-it-ons and
                  Neer-a-heads, and river galls, right down to marmaids.
               Waell, you see, all this here talk made us dry as thunder; so, the chaplain said,
                  he guessed the sun was over the fore-yard, and baled us out another horn o' licker
                  all round. Then he took a "spell-ho!" at the jawin'-tackle, and allowed there was
                  a river in Jarminy where all our Dutch imegrants hails from, and that a naked gall
                  used to locate herself in a whirlpool, and come up on moonshiney nights, and sing
                  a hull bookful o' songs, as turned the heads o' all the young fellers in them
                  parts. Waell, reports ruz up, as she'd a hull cargo o' gold stowed away at the
                  bottom o' the whirlpool, and many a wild young Jarman, seduced by the gall's
                  singin', and hopes o' gold, lept into the river, and warn't heerd on never arter.
                  These matters hurt the young gall's kariter, and the old folks, who'd always
                  allowed that she was a kind of goddess, began to think that she warn't the clear
                  grit, and the young fellers said her singin' was no great shakes, and that her
                  beauty warn't the thing it was cracked up to be.
               There was a famous general, who was n't raised in that section o' the country, but
                  had swapped a castle on a mountain in Spain, for one o' them ar' water lots, near
                  the whirlpool; he began to find himself rayther short o' cash to buy his
                  groceries, and, concluding that he couldn't dew without a leetle whiskey, to keep
                  off the aguy, resolved to pay the whirlpool gall, a visit, and jest see if he
                  couldn't soft soap the young critter out of a leetle rhino. Next full moon, he
                  tortles to the bluff what hung over the bilin' and foamin' river, and jest at
                  eight bells, up ruz the gall, stark naked, a sittin' on the white froth o' the
                  whirlin' water, and singin', "Won't you come to my bower what I've shaded for
                  you?" "Waell," says the gineral, not a bit daunted—says he, "look here, my gall, I
                  meant to eat a lobster salad with you to-night, if you promise to behave like a
                  lady, and won't cut up no infarnal shines." Waell, the gall give her word o'
                  honor, and the gineral dove into the whirlpool, and down they went right slick.
                  Next mornin' the gineral was found to hum with a sighter old gold pieces, bigger
                  round than the top of a 'backer box, and a hull pot full o' the tallest kind 'o
                  jewels; you see, the sojer had carried a small flask of Monongahely in his pocket,
                  and the river gall couldn't git over the old rye—tew glasses opened her heart, I
                  guess, and she let the gineral slip his cable in the mornin' with jest abeout as
                  much gold as he could stow away. Some o' his friends kalkilated as he'd better
                  drop his anchor thar' agin—and there was some talk in the settlement of forming a
                  jynt-stock company for the purpose o' gettin' up all the gold—but the gineral
                  tell'd 'em he guessed he'd got enough for him, and he seed quite enough down thar'
                  not to want to go no more; and refusin' to say what he had seen, or tell 'em how
                  they was to go to work, it kinder stopped the jynt-stock company. The river gall
                  she fell quite in love with the gineral right up to the hub, and sot on the bilin'
                  water night arter night, singin' "Meet me by moonlight alone,"—but the gineral
                  said he'd see her hanged first afore he trust her agin—for, says he, "no woman was
                  never deceived twyst," which riled the river gall like mad, and in revenge she sot
                  the whirlpool a bilin' like all creation as if resolved to keep the neighborhood
                  in hot water. From the sarcumstance of the gineral's gettin' so much gold out o'
                  the river, the Jarmins called it the Rhino, and it's been known by something' like
                  that name ever since.
               When the chaplain had expended his yarn, he sarved out another allowance o'
                  licker. I recking that he was the raal grit for a parson—always doin' as he'd be
                  done by, and practisin' a darned sight more than he preached. "'Taint
                  Christian-like," says he, "to drink by one's self, and a raal tar never objects to
                  share his grog with a shipmate." Them's the gin-a-wine Bunker Hill sentiments of
                  spiritual salvashing, and kinder touch the bottom of a sailor's heart!
               The middy then uncoiled another length o' cable abeout the fabbelous wimming o'
                  the sea, and said it were a tarnation pretty idea, that them angels from hevving
                  as ruled the airth should keep watch over the treasures o' the water. Then he
                  telled a yarn consarnin' the capting of a merchantman as was trading in the South
                  Seas, layin' at anchor, becalmed, one Sunday mornin' abeout five bells, when a
                  strange hail was heerd, from under the bows o' the craft, and the hands on deck as
                  answered the hail seed somebody in the water, with jest his head and arms sticken'
                  out, and holdin' on to the dolphing striker. Waell, I guess they pretty soon
                  throw'd him a rope and hauled him aboard and then they seed he was a regular built
                  marman, one half kinder nigger, and
                  tother half kinder fish but altogether more kinder fish than kinder nigger. So, as
                  I was tellin' you, they got him aboard, and he made an enquerry arter the capting,
                  who come out of his cabing, and the marman made him a first-rate dancin'-skeul
                  bow, and says  in ginnewine English, "Capting, I sorter recking it ain't
                  entered into your kalkilation as this here is Sabberday, for you've dropped your
                  tarnal big anchor right in front o' our meetin'-house door, and I'm d— if eeny of
                  our folks can go to prayers."
               Waell, the capting was rayther taking aback, and the calm, you see, overlayin' him
                  in that thar' hot latitude, had sot his back up above a bit; and besides that, he
                  felt considerable streeked at bein' roused out o' his mornin's nap for nothin';
                  so, altogether he felt sorter wolfish, and lookin' at the stranger darned
                  savagerous, says, "Who the ugly are you?"
               This here speech put the marman's dander up, for he says right sassy, "I guess I'm
                  appointed deacon over all the marmans and marmaids in these here parts, and I'll
                  jest trouble you to treat me with the respect, due tew a stranger and
                  a gentleman."
               Waell, I recking the capting's ebeneser was roused, for he seized hold of an
                  harpoon that was layin' on the fowksell, and hollored to the marman, "You fishy
                  vaggybund, make tracks out o' my ship, you sammony-tailed son of a sea-cook, or
                  I'll drive the grains slick through your scaly carkiss, I will." Waell, the
                  critter seein' as the capting meant danger, made but one flop with his tail, and
                  skeeted over the side o' the ship into the water. The capting did not weigh
                  anchor, nor nothin', only durin' the night the cable was cut by the marmen, and
                  the ship drifted on tew a corril reef, and rubbed a tarnal big hole in her
                  plankin'.
               "That's a good yarn," said the parson, "and I b'leve it's true as gospel. Nothin's
                  impossible in natur, and the hull o' these strange fixins as we hears tell on, is
                  nothin' more than links in the almighty great chain cable of universal natur'.
                  Bats is the link o' betweenity as connects the naturs o' fowls o' the air and the
                  beasts of the field. Seals and allgators links the naturs o' beasts and fishes.
                  Babboons and apes links beasts with humans; and why should not marmaids be the
                  links between humans and the fishes o' the sea? But there's the signal for the
                  boat's return; here's jest a leetle horn apiece in the bottle—let's licker one
                  more round, and then absquattle."
               We pulled quietly back to the ship. The barrel of brandy had not been found, and I
                  wish I may be sniggered if the capting did not fly into the biggest kind o'
                  quarter deck passion I ever did see. He stormed great guns and fired hull
                  broadsides at the boat's crew, swearin' that they should keep on dredgin' till the
                  tub was found, if it was the day arter eternity. So, you see, the hands was piped
                  tew dinner, but I was ordered tew keep in the boats and take keare they didn't
                  stave each other.
               Waell, I laid down in the capting's gig, and what with the parson's licker, and
                  the talk abeout marmaids and syringes, and water galls, and one thing and t'other,
                  a very pretty muss began mixing' in my brain pan. So, as I was layin' comfortably
                  moored in the starn sheets, with my head a leetle over the boat's quarter, I
                  thought it highly unwrong that the brandy tub hadn't been fotched up, and that the
                  men using the grapnels must have shirked as we did, cos, if they'd sarched as they oughter, they must have seed
                  the barrel, for the water was so pertickler clear that you could dissarn the crabs
                  crawlin' over the korril rocks at the bottom o' twenty fathom.
               Waell, while I was lookin' into thie ocean to see if I could light upon the
                  barrel, a leetle o' the largest fish I ever did see, come and swum right close to
                  the bottom of the sea, jest under the boats. Then it kept risin' and risin' till I
                  seed its long fins were' shaped like men's arms; and when it come near the sarfis,
                  it turned on its back, and then I seed a human face! I know'd at once that it was
                  a marmaid, or a marman—or one o' them amfibberus critters called fabbelus syringes
                  as the chaplain has been spinnin' his yarns abeout. So, the critter pops its head
                  up jest above the water, which was smooth as glass, and a little smoother tew by a
                  darned sight, and jest as clear and jest as shiny, and says he to me, "Look here,
                  stranger, you and your shipmates ain't doin' the genteel thing to me no how you
                  can fix it, for they're playing old hub with my garding grounds and oyster beds by
                  scratchin' and rakin' 'em all over with them ar' darned anchors and grapnel
                  fixins, in a manner that's harrowin' to my feelins. If the capting, wants his
                  thundernation licker tub, let him jest send eeny decent Christian down with me,
                  and I'll gin it him."
               Waell, I'm not goin' to say that I didn't feel a kinder skeered, but the
                  chaplain's yarns had rubbed the rough edge off, and the notion o' findin' the
                  capting's cask pleased me mightily, cos I knowed it would tickle the old man like
                  all creation, and sartingly get me three or four liberty days for shore goin' when
                  we returned to Port Mahon. So as I hadn't on nothing pertikler as would spile,
                  only a blue cotting shirt, and sail-cloth pantys, and the weather bein' uncommon
                  warm, I jest told the marman I was ready, and tortled quietly over the boat's side
                  into the blue transparent sea.
               The marman grappled me by the fist, and we soon touched bottom, now I tell ye. I
                  found as I could walk easy enough, only the water swayed me abeout jest as if I
                  war a leetle tight, but I didn't seem to suffer nothin' for want o' breath,
                  nyther.
               We soon reached whar' the brandy cask was lyin' right under the ship's keel, which
                  accounts for it's not bein' seen nor nothin' by thee boats' crews. I felt so
                  everlastingly comical abeout findin' the tub, that I told the half-bred dolphing
                  feller as pinted it out, that if I knowd how to tap it, I wish I might die if I
                  wouldn't give him a gallon of the stuff as a salvage fee.
               "What's in it?" says the marman.
               "Why, licker," says I.
               "Waell" says the marman, "so I heerd them scrapin' fellers in the boats say; but I
                  guess I've licker enough to last my time, tho' I recking your licker is something
                  stronger than salt water, seein' its hooped up in that almighty way."
               "Why, you lubber," says I, "it's brandy—the rael gennewine coney hack."
               "And what's that?" says the marman.
               "Why, dew tell—want to know?" says I, "have you lived to your time o' life without
                  tastin' spirretus licker? Waell, I sware, you ought to be the commodore of all
                  them cold water clubs, and perpetual president of all temp'rance teetotallers. Go
                  ahead, matey, pilot the way to your shanty, and I'll roll the barrel arter you.
                  I'll sune give you a  drink o'licker that will just take the shirt tail
                  of eenything you ever did taste, now I tell YOU."
               
               Waell, the critter flopped ahead, for you see it's the natur' o' the marmen,
                  seein' as they've no legs, only a fish's tail what's bent under them, jest like
                  the lower part o' the letter J, to make way by floppin' their starns up and down,
                  and paddlin' with their hands—somethin' between a swim and a swagger—but the way
                  they get through the water is a caution. I rolled the tub along over the smooth,
                  white, shiny sand, and the crabs and lobsters skeeted off right and left sides,
                  out o' my way, regular skeered, and big fishes of all shapes and makes, with
                  bristlin' fins, swum close alongside me, and looked at me quite awful with their
                  small gooseberry eyes, as much as to say, "What the nation are you at?"
               Bymeby, the marman brought up in front of rayther a largeish cave, or grotto of
                  rock and shell-work, kivered with korril and seaweed. So, you see, the tub was put
                  right on eend in one corner; I made an enquerry o' the marman, if he had a gimlet,
                  and he said he b'lieved there was sitch a thing in the hold or cellar; he'd found
                  a carpenter's tool-chest in a wreck a few miles to the easterd, and he fetched
                  away six or seving o' the little fixings, thinkin' they might be useful to him.
                  So, he opened the back-door, and hailed a young marman to bring him the
                  gimblet.
               Seein' as there was no benches, nor nothin' to sit down on, which marmen and
                  marmaids don't desire, cos they've no sittin parts to their bodies, which is all
                  fish to their waistbands, I jest sot on the top o' the brandy tub, and took an
                  observation of the critter before me. His face was a reglar human, only it looked
                  rather tawney and flabby like a biled nigger, with fishy eyes, and a mouth like a
                  huge tom cod. His hair hung stret down his shoulders, and was coarse and thick
                  like untwisted rattlin'; his hands were something like a goose's paw, only the
                  fingers were longer and thicker—and his body was not exactly like an Injin's, nor
                  a nigger's, nor a white man's—nor was it yaller, nor blue, nor green—but a sorter
                  altogether kinder mixed up color, lookin' as if it were warranted to stand the
                  weather. Jest abeout midships, his body was tucked into a fish's belly, with huge
                  green scales right down to the tail.
               Whilst I was surveyin' the marman fore and aft, the back-door opened, and a she
                  critter flopped in, with a young marman at the breast. The leetle sucker was not
                  bigger than a pickerel, with a tail of a delicate sammon color, and a head and
                  body jest like one o' them small tan monkeys, with a face as large as a dollar.
                  The marman introduced the she critter as his wife, and we soon got into a coil of
                  talk right slick, all abeout the weather, and the keare and trouble o' a young
                  family—and I wished I may be swamped if the marmaid warn't a dreadful nice critter
                  to chatter. Like all wimming folk, she was  plaguey kewrous as to whar' I
                  was raised and rigged; and when I said, I guess I hailed from Cape Cod, and all
                  along shore thar', she looked at the marman, and said to me, "Waell, I never—Cape
                  Cod! why, stranger, I guess there must be some finity in our breeds."
               Waell, you see, I grew rather kewrous tew, and wanted to log the pertiklers o' the
                  nateral history o' the race o' marmen—so I made a few enquerries respectin' their
                  ways o' life. "I guess," says I, "you've a tarnal good fish-market in these here
                  parts, and keep your table well supplied with hallibut and sea-bass, and
                  black-fish, eh?"
               "Why, stranger," says the marman, rather wrathy, "seein' it's you, I won't be
                  offended, or, by Hevving, if that speech ain't enough to make a marman feel scaly,
                  why then it ain't no matter. We claim to be half fish in our natur', and I recking
                  you don't kalkilate we gobbles our relations? there's sea varmint enough in all
                  conscience, sitch as oysters, and clams, and quahogs, and muscles, and crabs, and
                  lobsters. We go the hull shoat with them; and then we cultivates kail, and other
                  sea truck in our gardings, and sometimes we swims under the wild fowl as they're
                  floatin', and jerks down a fine duck or a gull, or gathers their eggs off the
                  rocks, or the barnacles off drift wood."
               Jest then, the marman's eldest son-fish fetched in the gimblet, and brought up the marman's jawin' tacks with a round
                  turn. The young un was about the size of an Injin boy jest afore he runs
                  alone—half papoose, half porpus. He got a leetle skeered when he clapt eyes on me,
                  but I guv' him a stale quid o' backer to amuse himself, and the sugar plum made
                  the marmaster roll his eyes above a bit, now I tell you.
               Waell, I bored a hole in the brandy tub, and pickin' up an empty clam shell,
                  handed a drink to the lady, and told her to tote it down. She swaller'd it pretty
                  slick, and the way she gulped arterwards, and stared, and twisted her fishy mouth,
                  was a sin to Davy Crockett. The marman looked rather wolfy at me, as if I'd gin
                  her pison so I drawed a shell-full and swallered it myself. This kinder cooled him
                  down and when the marmaid got her tongue tackle in runnin' order agin, she said
                  she guessed the licker was the juice of Hevving, and she'd be darned if she
                  wouldn't have another drink right off the reel.
               Seein' this, the marman swallered his dose, and no sooner got it down, than he
                  squealed right out, and clapped his webby hands together, and wagged his tail like
                  all creation. He swore it was elegant stuff, and he felt it tickle powerful from
                  the top of his head to the eend of his starn-fin. Arter takin' two or three horns
                  together, the sonny cried for a drink, and I gin him one that sent him wrigglin'
                  on the sand like an eel in an uneasiness. So, the marman said as the licker was
                  raal first-rate, and first rater than that tew, he guessed he'd ask in his next
                  door neighbor and his lady, jest to taste the godsend. Waell, in a minnit, in
                  comes a huge marman of the most almighty size, looking jest like Black Hawk when
                  he was bilious; he fotched up his lady with him, and his eldest son, a scraggy
                  hobbadehoy marman, and his darters, two young marmaids, or marmisses, jest goin'
                  out o' their teens, who flapped their yaller-skinned paws over their
                  punking-coloured chops, pretendin' to be almighty skeered at comin' afore a
                  strange man in a state o' natur'—but they forgot all abeout that thar', when the
                  licker was handed to them.
               Arter takin' a few smallers, the fresh marman said he guessed the clam shell was
                  altogether tew leetle to get a proper amount of licker, whereby a feller could
                  judge correctly of the raal taste o'the stuff; so he went to his berth in the next
                  cave, and fotched a large blue and silver shell that held abeout a pint.
               The news o' the brandy tub spread pretty slick, for in half-an-hour I'd the hull
                  grist o' the marmen belongin' to that settlement cooped up in the cavern. Sitch a
                  noisy swillin' set o' wet souls I never did see; the drunk com' on 'em almighty
                  strong, for they kept me sarvin' out the licker jest as quick as it could run. I
                  thought if the capting could have seen me astridin' his brandy cask, in an
                  underground grocery at the bottom o' the sea, surrounded by sitch a skeul of odd
                  fish, how many dozen at the gangway would he have ordered the bosen's mate to have
                  sarved me out?
               The way the drunk affected the different critters was right kewrous, now I tell
                  you. One great scaly feller stiffened his tail all up, and stood poppindickler
                  erect an the peaked points of the eend fin, like a jury-mast, and jawed away raal
                  dignified at all the rest, wantin' them to appoint him a sort o' admiral over the
                  hull crew. Another yaller feller with a green tail, was so dreadful blue, that he
                  doubled himself into a figgery 5, and sung scraps and bits o' all sorts o' sea
                  songs, till he got tew drunk to speak at all. Some o' the marmen wanted to kiss
                  all the marmaids, and tew o' the ladies began scratchin' and fightin' like two
                  pusseys, cos one trod on t'other's tail. Some went floppin' and dancin' on the
                  sand like mad, raisin' sitch a dust that I could not see to draw the licker—but
                  the party round the tub soon druv' them to the right abeout, as interferin' with
                  the interest o' the settlement. Every minnit some fresh marman dropped on the
                  ground with the biggest kind of load on; I never seed a set o' critters so
                  almighty tight, yellin', swearin', and fightin', till they growed so darned
                  savagerous that I kinder feared for my own safety amongst them drunken moffradite
                  sea aborgoines. So, you see, I up and told 'em that I'd clapt my veto on the
                  licker, and that they should not have any more.
               Waell, if ever you did hear a most eternal row, or see a hull raft o' drunken
                  fellers cut didoes, then was the time. It was voted that I were a
                  public enemy, and every half drunken marman suddenly became very 'fishus to have
                  me Lynched, and it were settled at last that I were to be rode on a rail, and then
                  tarred and feathered. But, while some o' the varmint went arter the rail and the
                  tar, the rest o' the critters began quarrelin' who was to sarve out the licker;
                  and as each marman, drunk or sober, wanted to have the keare o' the precious
                  stuff, they soon raised a pretty muss, and kept on tearin' at each other like a
                  pack o' wolves. Seein' this, I jest sneaked quietly away from the cave grocery,
                  till I com' in sight o' the ship, when I struck upperd for the sarfis, and swum
                  for dear life. I soon seed that the boats' crews were musterin' for another bout
                  o' draggin' for the brandy cask, so, feerin' least the capting should miss me, I
                  jest laid hold o' the edge o' the gig, and crawled in pretty quickly, and laid
                  myself down in the starn sheets, as if I'd never been out o' the boat.
               I hadn't laid thar' half a second, when I heerd a noise jest for all the world as if somebody was squeezin' a
                  small thunder cloud right over my head. I ruz up, and thar' were the capting and
                  the hull crew  lookin' over the ship's side at me—the officers in a
                  tarnal rage, and the men grinnin' like so many hyenas.
               "Rouse up, you long-sided lazy swab, and bring the boats in from the boom. Are you
                  goin' to sleep all day?"
               "Ay, ay, sir," said I, jumpin' up in the boat, when all the water ran off me like
                  forty-thousand mill-streams—I'd been so outrageous soaked while down with the
                  marmen. I felt kinder skeered lest the capting should see it, but when I stood up
                  he laughed right out, and so did the hull crew, tew.
               "Why, he's not awake yet," said the capting. "Bo'sen, give him another
                  bucket."
               You see they wanted to persuade me that I'd fell asleep in the gig, as fast as a
                  meetin'-house, and slept thar the hull while the crew were at dinner, and that no
                  shoutin' nor nothin' couldn't wake me up—so, bo'sen run along the boom, and jest
                  give me a couple o' buckets o' sea water right over me. When I told 'em my yarn
                  abeout the marman poppin' up his head, and invitin' me down, and all abeout
                  findin' the brandy tub and the rest, they swore that I'd got drunk on the parson's
                  licker, and dreamt it all in the boat. But I guess I know what I did see, jest
                  abeout as slick as anybody; and the chaplain b'lieved the hull story; and said
                  that as I'd learned the marmen the valley o' licker, they'd get huntin' up all the
                  tubs and barrels out of the different wrecks in all the various seas; and that
                  intemperance would spile the race, and thin 'em off till they become one o' the
                  things that was—jest like the Injins what's wastin' away by the power o' rum and
                  whiskey given 'em by the white men.
               I recking the parson warn't far out in his kalkilashing. The love o' licker has
                  had its effect upon the marmen and the marmaids; they must leave thinned off
                  surprisin'ly, for I aint seed none since, nor I don't know nobody that has,
                  nyther.
            
            
               MAC DERMOTT ON THE WIDOW GREEN.
               
                  
                  WHEN the militia were disembodied a number of meritorious soldiers
                  like myself, were permitted to exchange the sword for the ploughshare, and become
                  members of that respectable portion of the Connaught community, usually designated
                  "walking gentlemen." My campaign in the gallant Galway had unfitted me for any
                  honest calling—and now, "my occupation gone"—after the hunting season ended, I
                  tired of the monotony of Kiltycormack, and the ennui of a life of idleness heavily oppressed me. My father, as a
                  panacea for my complaint, recommended farming; my mother proposed matrimony; and
                  the domestic confessor, as in duty
                  bound, averred, upon his conscience, that there was no cure for a case like mine,
                  but "rum and true religion." To the use of all and every of these remedies I felt
                  disinclined, when the opportune arrival of my maternal uncle, Captain O'Flaherty,
                  to spend the Easter holidays, decided my fate.
               It was after dinner, and I had strolled out into the garden, leaving my honored
                  parents, their worthy guest, and Father Dennis Boyle, in close divan. My father
                  extracted a fresh cork. "Dick," he said, addressing the gallant captain, "I don't
                  know what to do with Frank. It's a mortal sin to see a strapping fellow like him
                  idling about the stables. I offered him the farm of Durneein, and to stock it into
                  the bargain—but he won't have it."
               "And I wanted him," said my lady-mother, "to marry Judith O'Brien. He can have
                  Judy for the asking; and she has two thousand pounds, and that ready."
               "Two hundred a-year when her grandfather hops the twig," added the commander.
               "And the devil a soul her uncle has to give a rap to, as everybody knows, but her
                  own four bones—and Father Bradley will leave a churn full of half-crowns behind
                  him," quoth the confessor.
               "And what objection can the boy have to the match?" inquired Captain
                  O'Flaherty.
               "The family is objectionable," rejoined my sire. Her grandfather was a
                  brogue-maker—and her aunt went off with a recruiting sergeant."
               "Well, you know that Frank would have no fancy to claim kindred with Father
                  Bradley; and there's a prejudice against priests' nieces in general. It will never
                  do," observed the captain. "But I have it; send him to England. He's a
                  tearing-looking fellow—let him but play his cards decently, and he'll bring home
                  an heiress in half a year. Nothing goes down there but an Irishman—and the more
                  brogue the better."
               After, what is termed in parliamentary language "an animated debate," it was
                  decided that I should proceed directly to the British metropolis, put myself in
                  the way of fortune, and conquest was a matter of course.
               On this excellent errand of fortune-hunting I bade adieu to home, and reached
                  London safely. I took lodgings in a private street, near Russell-square; and
                  spent—as fresh ones generally do—a whole week in looking for and at the
                  "lions."
               Before I had occupied my quarters many days, I could not avoid noticing the marked
                  attention with which my movements were observed by a stout gentlewoman, my
                  opposite neighbor. I inquired from my hostess who was the person under whose
                     surveillance I found myself; and learned that
                  she was the widow of a tradesman, and had been left extremely wealthy.
               A month passed: no heiress presented herself; and all I had to comfort me was the
                  increased admiration of my fat friend and neighbor, Mrs. Green. The Ascot meeting
                  came, and thither, of course, I hastened; for there beauty would be found—and to
                  one so deep in the arcana of the turf as I, the trip, no doubt, would prove
                  profitable as pleasant. The week passed over on which I made my début, and its history shall be a brief one.
               I found myself a "cleaned-out man," and master of a solitary guinea.
               Never was an Irish Gentleman in more uncharitable temper with the human race than
                  myself as I crossed Russell Square, on the way to my own domicile. It was
                  evening—and I remarked a young lady issue from a house, leading a Blenheim spaniel
                  in a ribbon leash. She was scarcely twenty yards before me, when a vulgar,
                  over-dressed fellow accosted her, to her evident annoyance. The lady quickened her
                  pace, and so did her persecutor. He whispered something and she averted her head;
                  but, with intolerable impudence, the fellow seized the ribbon and took possession
                  of the favorite. I hurried up. The girl, with tears running down her pretty face,
                  was vainly remonstrating with the scoundrel—but I took a shorter and more
                  successful method—kicked him off the pathway—restored the spaniel to his
                  mistress—and offered my protection, which was promptly and gratefully
                  accepted.
               We traversed several streets, and stopped at a handsome residence, which the lady
                  informed me was her father's. She thanked me, and bade me good evening. I lingered
                  for a moment—ascertained the number of the house—and read upon a brass plate the
                  name of "Mr. Selwyn."
               As I walked home, my head was in a whirlwind—one while brooding over my losses; at
                  another dreaming of the pretty girl and her dog. I threw myself on the sofa and
                  commenced castle-building, when my reveries were broken by the maid, who handed me
                  a sealed note. I opened it. For the life of me I could not but laugh—it was an
                  invitation to tea, from Mrs. Green, the stout gentlewoman opposite. Should I
                  accept it? Pshaw! the thing was too ridiculous: she was older than my mother. I
                  hesitated: that evening, I had nothing to do: hang it, it would kill time for an
                  hour. I took my hat, crossed the street, and found myself in the presence of the
                  sugar-boiler's widow.
               
               I shall abridge the interview. Mrs. Green recovered her self-possession first, and
                  came at once to business. She had four hundred pounds a year; ten thousand pounds
                  in the three per cents.; her house was freehold property; and all was in her own
                  power, to dispose of as she pleased. She was a "lone woman, God help her!" her
                  relatives were worthless and undutiful—she wanted a husband and an heir—and the
                     finale was, that her hand and fortune were at
                  my disposal.
               Odds wrinkles! here was a confession! What was I to say or do? I stammered out my
                  thanks; told the old story—not a marrying man—but, of course, eternally obliged by
                  the preference; took a polite leave of the dowager, and kissed the maid as she let
                  me out.
               I awoke next morning-possessor of a guinea, and deeply enamored with the mistress
                  of the pretty Blenheim. London without supplies is, as everybody admits, a less
                  endurable place than purgatory—though the latter has certainly a bad name. I
                  breakfasted—sat down to write a penitential letter, and request an immediate
                  remittance. But before I had proceeded with my epistle, the postman's knock was
                  heard, and a letter, in the well-known handwriting of my worthy father, was duly
                  delivered by the maid.
               I broke the seal impatiently. Heaven and earth! what a detail of adverse fortune
                  that brief despatch contained! It is needless to particularize; but unless one
                  thousand pounds were immediately procured, he, with ample means, must yield to the
                  unexpected pressure of the times, and become, like hundreds of others, an
                  insolvent.
               I knew my parent's temper: his proud heart would break. What was to be done? I
                  flung myself in bitter agony upon the sofa, as Mrs. Green's maid came a second
                  time, to ask me to see her mistress for five minutes.
               Why need I dwell upon it? My father's difficulties had driven me desperate. I
                  listened calmly to the dowager, and told her frankly how I was embarrassed. The
                  interview ended in my giving an assurance that I would marry her next day, and in
                  her transferring eleven hundred pounds to me; of which sum I remitted a thousand
                  to Ireland by that night's post.
               I redeemed my promise faithfully.
               To remain another day in London was insupportable. I pleaded indisposition,
                  obtained leave of absence for a week to visit Cheltenham, and left my blooming
                  bride on the evening of the same day which made her mine.
               I was far too early for the coach. Where should I turn my steps to? To my own
                  house—for I was now absolute master of a dwelling. No, no—any place but that home
                  for me. I walked rapidly to the square; and from the same house, the sweet girl
                  whom two evenings before I had rescued from insult issued with her favorite—the
                  little Blenheim.
               I advanced—God knows why. She recognised me, and with smiles bade me a good
                  evening. With all the artless warmth of a young heart, she thanked me again for
                  protecting her.
               O how deeply every word stung me to the soul! Here was a being—young, artless, and
                  beautiful. I could have loved her—worshipped her. But I was bound to one from whom
                  I could expect no congenial feelings. Every evening found me walking with my
                  pretty Marianne. I resided in a village near town; the week elapsed; I remained
                     perdu and postponed my return to the Greek
                  kalends. The sugar-boiler  relict was not inclined, however, to become a
                  consenting party to this arrangement; and on the very day my leave of absence had
                  expired she bundled off to reclaim her truant lord.
               
               It so happened that one of the "finest peasantry on the earth" had honored me with
                  a call. Accident introduced him to the dowager and Tony Magin undertook, for a
                  consideration, to restore me to her longing arms. He averred that none could do it
                  but himself; "he would know my skin upon a bush, and swear to my walk a mile off."
                  Sure enough, the scoundrel redeemed his pledge—popped upon me during one of my
                  evening interviews—and having strong suspicions that a recognition would cost him
                  broken bones, Tony prudently declined renewing our acquaintance in the street, but
                  watched me home, and reported to the "lady gay" the exact spot where her errant
                  consort might be discovered.
               I, in the innocency of my heart, dreamed not of the agreeable surprise in
                  preparation, and wrapped up in my dressing-gown, was drowning easy thought over a
                  cup of tea—when the door opened—no doubt "the maid of all work" with a fresh
                  muffin. A pair of lusty arms enfolded me—I looked up—my "bonny bride" had locked
                  me closely in her embrace! Behind, the villain Tony was standing; for, doubtful of
                  the reception his employer would receive, he prudently enacted rear-rank man,
                  keeping the door ajar, to secure a retreat on the first demonstration of
                  hostilities.
               I returned a captive; but the contiguity of my dear Marianne was, I suspect, the
                  motive that influenced, on my part, this passive submission. Alas! I seldom saw
                  her afterwards, as her father left London for the Continent. During our last walk
                  I took leave of her, and the secrets of both hearts were revealed. I loved her,
                  and my passion was returned. To confess the story of my marriage, was an effort
                  that I had neither virtue nor resolution to achieve; and all Marianne knew was,
                  that at present a barrier to our happiness existed; and I solemnly promised that
                  were it removed, I should make her mine.
               To exist in town after that she left it was impossible.
               I levanted forthwith, and my adventures for the next three months would fill a
                  volume.
               All this time my marriage was a secret to my family—and the thousand I had
                  remitted home enabled my father to surmount difficulties, and maintain his
                  independence, while all around were ruined.
               A month passed quietly; no attempt at recapture had been made; and I began to hope
                  that my fat admirer would not prove a Penelope, but allow time to abate her
                  sorrow, and obliterate the image of her absent lord. My father spoke occasionally
                  on "settling in the world;" and my mother dropped sly hints touching Miss Judy
                  O'Brien. She was a greater catch, it would appear, than ever; for the priest had
                  been 'gathered to his fathers, after bequeathing the produce of his clerical
                  exertions to this, his favorite niece.
               It was a fine autumnal evening; Captain O'Flaherty had come over to shoot
                  partridges, and a few friends were invited to do him honor. All, save the parson
                  attended in good time; and he being a late man, it was resolved to vote him
                  present. Dinner was ordered accordingly, when wheels grated over the gravel,
                  announcing that the absentee was come.
               "Step out, Arthur," said the captain; "hurry the doctor, or he'll take half an
                  hour to peel in the hall, as he never ventures out in the evening
                  without being swathed like a mummy."
               I obeyed the order—opened the door—and found myself in the close embraces of a
                  female, while a well-remembered voice exclaimed triumphantly, behind—"Arrah!
                  didn't I tell ye, mistress dear, that if he was over ground, I would find him for
                  ye?"
               I was petrified with horror; but disengaging myself from my consort's arms, jumped
                  down the steps; repaid Tony's exertions in recovering me with a flush hit, that
                  left him sprawling on the ground; rushed madly to the stables—and leaping upon a
                  visitor's horse, which fortunately remained saddled, rode off at speed I hardly
                  knew whither.
               I stopped at an obscure shebeen-house, and despatched a courier for
                  Captain O'Flaherty. He came—and wisely decided, that, for such ardent attachment
                  as the sugar-boiler's widow's, there was no safety but in the grave. My hat and
                  clothes were, one night, left upon the bank of the river, found there next
                  morning, and announced the melancholy certainty of my having come to an untimely
                  end. Deep was the general distress, and great the exertions of the peasantry to
                  find the corpse, and lay me in the resting-place of my forefathers. But their
                  efforts were ineffectual.
               You know my story now. I have only to add, that my wife is erecting a tombstone to
                  my memory, and that the obituary notices in the newspapers were numerous and
                  flattering. Hitherto I have remained undiscovered. Captain O'Flaherty sends me the
                  supplies—and I expect to find a letter from him waiting for me at Rome. I may as
                  well tell all. Marianne was the magnet that brought me here. You have seen her,
                  and may, before many days pass, have the pleasure again. High ho! Why do you keep
                  the bottle there? Don't you perceive how much that confession has overcome me?
               I could not, when we separated, but ponder on the madcap's history; and when I did
                  sleep, dreamed that Tony had discovered us in the Capitol, and that the
                  disconsolate bride had memorialized his Holiness the Pope for restitution of
                  conjugal rights.
            
            
               
               MY WIFE'S PIANO.
               THE deed is accomplished. My wife has got a piano, and now farewell the tranquil
                  mind—farewell content and the evening papers, and the big cigars that make
                  ambition virtue—oh, farewell! "And oh! ye mortal engines, whose rude throats the
                  immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit!" But stop, I can't bid them farewell,
                  for one of them has just arrived. It came on a dray. Six men carried it into the
                  parlor, and it grunted awfully. It weighs a ton—shines like a mirror—and has
                  carved Cupids climbing up its limbs. And such lungs—whew! My wife has commenced to
                  practise, and the first time she touched the machine, I thought we were in the
                  midst of a thunder storm, and the lightning had struck the crockery chests. The
                  cat, with tail erect, took a bee line for a particular friend upon the back fence,
                  demolishing a six shilling pane of glass. The baby awoke, and the little fellow
                  tried his best to beat the instrument, but he couldn't do it. It beat him. A
                  teacher has been introduced into the house. He says he is the last of Napoleon's
                  grand army. He wears a huge moustache, looks at me fiercely, smells of garlic, and
                  goes by the name of Count Run-away-and-never-come-back-again-by. He played an
                  extract de opera the other night. He run his fingers through his hair twice, then
                  grinned, then he cocked his eyes up at the ceiling, like a monkey hunting flies,
                  then came down one of his fingers, and I heard a delightful sound, similar to that
                  produced by a cockroach dancing upon the tenor string of a fiddle. Down came
                  another finger, and I was reminded of the wind whistling through a knot hole in a
                  hen coop. He touched his thumb, and I thought that I was in an orchard listening
                  to the distant braying of a jackass. Now he ran his fingers along the keys, and I
                  thought of a boy rattling a stick upon a picket fence. All of a sudden he stopped,
                  and I thought something had happened. Then down came both fists, and oh, Lord!
                  such a noise was never heard before. I thought a hurricane had struck the house,
                  and the walls were caving in. I imagined I was in the cellar, and a ton of coal
                  was falling upon my head. I thought the machine had burst, when the infernal noise
                  stopped, and I heard my wife ejaculate—
               "Exquisite!" "What the deuce is the matter?" The answer was, "Why, dear, that's La
                  Sonnambula!" "D—n Sonnambula!" thought I; and the Count rolled up his sheet of
                  paper. He calls it music; but for the life of me, I can't make it look like
                  anything else than a rail fence with a lot of juvenile niggers climbing over it.
                  Before that instrument meant of torture came into the house, I could enjoy myself,
                  but now every darned woman in the neighborhood must be invited to hear the
                   new piano, and every time the blasted thing shrieks out, like a
                  locomotive with the bronchitis, I have to praise its tone, and when the invited
                  guests are playing I have to say, "Exquisite:" "Delightful!" "Heavenly!" and all
                  such trash, while, at the same time, I know just as much about music as a blind
                  codfish. There are more tuning hammers than comforts in our house, and—and I wish
                  the inventor of the piano was troubled with a perpetual nightmare, and obliged to
                  sleep in one of his instruments all his life. As for myself, I had rather put my
                  head under a tin pan and be drummed to sleep with a pair of smoothing irons than
                  hear "La Sonnambula," or any other La thumped out of a piano. Scatter pennies in
                  front of my house, and draw together all the wandering minstrels in the city—hand
                  organs, banjos, fiddles, tamborines, rattling bones, and fish horns. Let juvenile
                  monkeys crawl in at my windows in search of three cent pieces—let me be awakened
                  at mid night by the cry of "murder!"—ring the fire bells and have a devil of a
                  time generally—do all this, and I will not complain; but banish the pianos. My
                  piano has got to go. I am going to launch the infernal machine out of the window
                  the first dark night, and, my friends, I advise you to sleep with cotton in your
                  ears, or when she gives her dying grunt you'll think you've fallen out of bed, or
                  a fallen star has gone to roost upon your housetop. For the information of "Young
                  America," I will state that all the pieces of brass wire and ivory keys they are
                  welcome to, but the skeleton I want for a refrigerator.
            
            
               
               THE OCEAN BRIDE.
               A TALE OF CRINOLINE.
               
                  
                  NOW it was blowing a brisk gale, under a bright autumnal sky, on the
                  south coast. The tide was coming in, dashing wave after wave in foam and spray
                  upon the rocks, with which the beach was studded. Smythe Walsingham and Aubrey De
                  Wells were stemming the teeth of the wind, by walking right in the face of it
                  along the shingly sea-weedy shore. From among the rocks on which the waves were
                  rapidly gaining, started, like a hare from its form, an elegant female figure,
                  fashionably attired. An expansive straw-hat protected her complexion, and a
                  profusion of drapery swept the pebbles on which she trod, or rather skipped. With
                  a rapid succession of bounds, she ascended the slope of the shore till she reached
                  its level; where there was a seat, on which she sat down.
               "I say," said Smythe to his companion.
               "See that?" returned Aubrey.
               "What can she have been after?" Walsingham wondered.
               "Collecting shells and sea-weed," replied De Wells. "Blue-stockings, no
                  doubt."
               "I'm afraid not," said Walsingham. "She may wear a blue stocking on one leg, but
                  do you know, I think the other is a wooden one."
               "Nonsense!" exclaimed De Wells.
               "I do. I'll bet you a guinea it is."
               "Done."
               "Yes, but how are you to find out."
               "I'll manage that. You light your cigar, and walk up and down."
               "I wish," sighed Walsingham, "I were as impudent a fellow, Aubrey, as you
                  are."
               He ignited his Cuba, and retraced his steps, whilst his friend, pursuing his
                  onward course, approached the bench on which the subject of his wager had placed
                  herself, and, with quiet self-possession, seated himself by her side. She
                  immediately turned upon him a face of marvellous beauty, the particulars of which
                  space forbids us to detail. It was illuminated by a bewitching smile, which seemed
                  to tell him he was no intruder. He uttered an involuntary exclamation of
                  admiration tion and delight; and then he begged her pardon. She laughed: and De
                  Wells gazed at her in speechless rapture.
               "What are you thinking of?" she quietly demanded.
               "Can it be?" exclaimed the young man. "No; it is impossible."
               "Will you be good enough," she laughingly said, "to let me know what the
                  impossibility is?"
               "Excuse me, I could not breathe it. You would never forgive me."
               "Words uttered in the wind fly far," said the young lady. "What did your companion
                  say to you about me?"
               "You overheard it then! And—oh!—of course you have not a wood—"
               "I have nothing whatever of the kind."
               "I knew it! beautiful being!"
               "Hush! You mean to say that you admire me?"
               "Admire you! Words cannot express—"
               "Yes, they can. You mean to say that you love me."
               "By Heavens!—"
               "Just so. You would marry me?"
               "Oh! that were happiness beyond imagination."
               "Not at all. Take this ring." He obeyed mechanically. "Now place it on my finger."
                  He did as he was desired. "Say, 'With this ring I thee wed.'" Spell-bound, as most
                  young men would have been under similar circumstances, he repeated the words. "Now
                  catch me!" she said; and, suddenly starting up, bounded down to the rocks whence
                  she had emerged. He instantly followed. In and out the crags and boulders, over
                  which the waves were rapidly rising, he sought, but sought the fugitive in vain.
                  In this tantalizing game at hide-and-seek he was at length interrupted by Smythe
                  Walsingham, who was tired of waiting. Walsingham joined him in the search, which
                  still proved fruitless. Doubtless the eccentric fair one was acquainted with the
                  locality, and had hidden herself in some secret cranny among the rocks. Just as
                  they had arrived at this conclusion, a large wave broke over them, and obliged
                  them to retire, not without some fear for the frolic fair one's safety. The bet
                  was drawn: the adventure in a little while forgotten.
               Three years after the event above related, Aubrey de Wells became the husband of
                  his cousin, Emily Tunbridge. At what may be playfully denominated the fatal
                  portion of the marriage service, the scene of the sportive wedding on the
                  sea-shore suddenly recurred to the mind of the bridegroom, causing his frame to
                  vibrate as with an electric shock. At the same moment a whistle, like that of the
                     sea-wind, rushed through the church,
                  which it is unnecessary to state was that of St. George, Hanover-square. All heard
                  it—with momentary astonishment, since the noise was a strange one to occur in such
                  a locality. The circumstance, however, was soon forgotten—its memory drowned in
                  the champagne of the wedding-breakfast. The happy pair left immediately for the
                  sea-coast—for that very part of it referred to in the commencement of this
                  narrative. Aubrey's glowing description of its romantic scenery had inspired his
                  young bride with a desire to make that spot their place of sojourn during their
                  honeymoon. Steam, in these days, rapidly annihilates space and time to render
                  lovers happy. The evening of their wedding-day saw them strolling towards the sea.
                  The wind was brisk, the air keen and bright, the sea rough as before. Sea-gulls
                  drifted close by them on their way, and one or two so much so as nearly to knock
                  Aubrey's hat off, to which narrowly-escaped casualty, engrossed with the thoughts
                  of love, he paid no attention. There is, once in the lives of most men, a time
                  when they feel that—which has been so often described that the description need
                  not here be repeated. Suddenly, just at the turning of a cliff, a female form
                  presented itself, emerging from behind a rock. Gracious Powers! it was the
                  same—that of her whom, three years ago, he had lost sight of amid those rocks. She
                  was attired, as before, in the long and spreading drapery, which is evidently
                  destined to be eternal; but the round hat was laid aside, and the hair was
                  fantastically dressed with corals and shells, and she was adjusting its tresses by
                  means of a comb and the help of a hand-mirror. She sang, or rather chanted, a wild
                  air, the burden of which was, "Come with me, oh! come with me!" and she beckoned
                  to Aubrey de Wells.
               "Ah" screamed Emily. "Who is that mad girl? Go away, and leave my husband
                  alone!"
               "Husband!" repeated the strange young lady satirically. "I like that. Come,
                  sir."
               Aubrey, with a convulsive movement, withdrew his arm from that of his wife, who
                  stood rooted with amazement to the spot. The Unknown again beckoned—he advanced
                  towards her as though attracted by a mesmeric influence. She placed her right hand
                  on his shoulder, took his in her left, and, by some unknown fascination, set him
                  whirling with her in a wild and headlong waltz towards the sea. As they sped, her
                  garments flew up above what should have been her knees; but, in place of limbs,
                  the terrified Emily beheld something which, from her description, appears to have
                  been the tail of a dolphin, of which the creature spun and gyrated upon the caudal
                  fin!
               Far, far away, over the green, green waves, where the wild, wild, &c.: all of
                  which may be imagined. The ill-fated Aubrey de Wells had been spirited off by a
                  mermaid!
               
                  
               
               Seven years elapsed, and Aubrey returned not. For seven years had he gone to sea,
                  and had never been heard of. Emily became, as she was legally entitled to do, the
                  bride of another. She married Smythe de Walsingham.
               O young men, ever, whilst long dresses last, that is to say, simply ever, take
                  care, ere you marry, to ascertain what they hide. It is possible, oh, horror! that
                  they may serve to conceal hoofs, if not a tail.
            
            
               
               EDITORIAL TROUBLES.
               THIS editor must be both a philosopher and a poet, as the following pathetic
                  rhyming record will abundantly prove:—Baby's got the measles, second boy is
                  drooping, third one down on the thrundle bed with dreaded cough is whooping.
                  Mercury down to zero, wood pile, some below it; man tries to be a hero, but feels
                  he cannot go it. Wife is busy washing a pile of dirty "duds," whilst ever and anon
                  a tear falls silent in the suds. Husband rocks the cradle, "second" on his lap,
                  soothes the third one with a kiss, and hits the fourth a slap. So from melancholy
                  moans, and startled troubled dreaming, the tune is changed to groans, stifled
                  sobs, and screaming. Patience all exhausted he roughly speeds the rocking, and
                  jolts the little sufferer with a roughness that is shocking. Confusion worse
                  confounded! A neighbor opens the door, and with voice astonished says, "Have you
                  heard the price of flour?" "No!" husband loudly halloes; "what's the latest
                   news?' "Flour's thirteen dollars! twelve has been refused." A scream!
                  'tis Sissy's voice: something comes athwart her. In she comes all covered o'er
                  with blood and dirty water. Old brindle's gored the heifer, and broke the
                  yearling's thigh, knocked Sissy down and cut her, and scared a passer-by." Wife
                  sits down despairing, weary of her life; husband, nothing caring for the
                  quadrupedal strife, wonders whether Job, the man of many sores, when his wife bade
                  him give up, led such a life indoors. Meanwhile the wealthy mother
                  sits in her easy chair, on its rich embroidered cover, 'mid comfort everywhere,
                  and wonders what they mean—these people that are poor—prating of their troubles,
                  which they think they endure. "If they only had her trials—know what
                     she underwent—they'd think that all the vials of wrath were on
                  them spent;" which sets us thinking, reader, that if rightly estimated, one-half
                  of our sorrows are sadly over-rated. And the moral of our rhyme, though prosely it
                  runs, is, never borrow trouble, but take it as it comes.
            
            
               A SERMON ON KEARDS, QUARTER HOSSES, FIDDLES AND FOOLIN' WITH THE GALS.
               
                  
                  OH! Their minister was certainly a study, he had just such a face
                  and air as a clever artist might have chosen to characterize the bell-wether of
                  some hill-hiding Covenanter flock. In short, it was stern, hard, and
                  uncompromising. Nor was his garb less singular, for he sported (may we be forgiven
                  for the phrase), a snuffy-brown coat, of strange and antiquated cut, which bore
                  but too evident tokens of long and not over careful usage. The continuations were
                  of yellowish-grey cloth, with stove-pipe legs, built like an Irishman's hurricane,
                  "straight up and down," and encased below the knees in serviceable-looking
                  buckskin riding-leathers, well stained with Missouri mud; add to these a pair of
                  buffalo overshoes, a surprising shirt collar, and a wonderfully starched linen
                  cravat, whose complicated folds and puritanical stiffness would have broken a "New
                  York washerwoman's heart at first sight," and you will have a very accurate
                  delineation of this reverend
                  gentleman's outer man. We must not forget, however, a pair of wide-bowed horn
                  spectacles which divided their time between the top of his venerable head, and the
                  bridge of an independently cocked-up nose, thereby adding not a little to the
                  grotesqueness of this somewhat unclerical tout
                     ensemble.
               The first selection from this parson's discourse is as follows:
               "Yes, my sin-stricken bretherin and sisters, thar Lord only knows how I'm to bring
                  this hyar congregation out of the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity;
                  whar's the sense of my wrastlin's in prayer? whar's the good of my groanin's in
                  sperit? whar's the use in my ridin' down hyar every Lord's day mornin', an' thar
                  corderoy mighty bad at that, to try an' save these hyar sinner from the brimstone
                  and fire as is to come? whar's the sense, I say, my bretherin? for I tell yeou
                  all, an' I jest allow that thar Lord knows it too, that thar's some of yeou a
                  settin' hyar, that dance out at thar toes in a week, all thar religion that thar
                  minister kin hammer inter thar heads, let alone thar hearts, with prar-meetin's,
                  and preachin', and singin' of psalms, through a 'hull year round. Yes, my
                  bretherin and sisters, it's thar wickedness of Christmas week, thar dancin', and
                  thar foolin', and thar drinkin', and thar gamblin', that does thar devil's work
                  hyar; an' whar will yeou be, my bretherin? yes, whar will you be, I say, when
                  Satan comes a huntin' his own, or as is remarked in thar Scripters, like a roarin'
                  lion a goin' round to see what he kin devour? take kear, my bretherin, take
                  kear."
               And again—in allusion to the prayer-meeting business:
               "Whar's the good in invitin' yeou inter prayer-meetin's, when yeou air always
                  excusin' yeourselves and never thar? Ef it war a cornhuskin', wouldn't yeou be
                  thar? Well, yeou would; and I jest know ef it war a
                  hoss-race, yeou'd be sure to be thar. But how is it, when we want yeou to serve
                  thar Lord, and call on yeou to come up an' help us,' are yeou thar
                     then? Well, yeou ain't, brethren, an' why ain't you? Why, because
                  thar ain't no keards, nor quarter hosses, nor fiddles, nor dancin' nor foolin'
                  with the gals, thar's the why. An' how was it tother night, my
                  bretherin, when deacon Graves and yeour preacher war all thar war thar? Well, it
                  rained, s'pose it did; air yeou sugar or air you salt? and wouldn't yeou hev gone,
                  ef you had bin sugar or salt, ef it war to a frolic? Well, yeou
                  would. Yeou're a travellin' thar broad road, the 'hull on you; it's dreadful nice
                  now; it ain't steep and hain't got no ruts inter it, but yeou'd better be a goin
                  the narrer one; yes, ef it war all corderoy and hog-wallow, yeou'd do well to be a
                  goin' of it; for when thar folks as travel it air a shoutin' glory, an halleluya,
                  whar will yeou be? A wailin' and a nashin' of yeour teeth, thar's
                  whar."
               And again:—
               "When I go inter thar house of a professor of religion, an' see thar, thar
                  begammon board, and thar dice-box, or may-be, a pack of keards a lyin' on thar
                  table, I allow that thar, in that house, thar's somethin' wrong. Do yeou see them
                  air things in my cabin, my bretherin, or in Deacon Graves's cabin?
                     Well, yeou don't. But thar's a Bible thar, an' a hymn-book, an' a
                  sound of prayer, an' a shout of thanksgivin' thar. Well, thar
                  is."
            
            
               NOSES—A PROBOSCIC POEM.
               BY THE WITTIEST OF ANGLO-SAXE-ONS.
               
                  
                     MOTTO—"I Nose what I Knows."
                  
               
               
                  Hail mighty nose! thou much insulted part;
                  Thy praises, like thyself, shall soon be "blown,"
                  And with the rise of Science and of Art,
                  Thou shalt arise 'till all the world shall own
                  That thou wert formed for nobler ends than these—
                  To carry spectacles, take snuff, and sneeze!
               
               
                  Hail mighty nose! thou Palace of the Soul!
                  Thou never-failing index to the heart!—
                  Thou Bishop of our life—made to control,
                  With proper supervisions every part,
                  Assist the Bard whose unpretending lays
                  Would gladly prove thy worth and sing thy praise
               
               
                  The Rynologic Science—that's the name—
                  Has had its votaries in every age,
                  Although, as yet, is quite unknown to fame,
                  And ne'er adorned the philosophic page;
                  I mean to say the maxims of mankind
                  Associate the human nose and mind;
               
               
                  Which prove the mind dependent on the nose,
                  Just as the nose is pendent from the face;
                  And this dependency most clearly shows
                  
                  The nasal organ is the real place
                  Where thoughts are born; and where they always stay,
                  Until they bribe the lips and get away!
               
               
                  But to the maxims—if a man's aggrieved,
                  "His nose is out of joint!" we all exclaim.
                  And if by any one a slight's received
                  He cries—"They've bridged my nose! O what a shame!"
                  And when a cunning demagogue proposes
                  To learn the people's mind, he "counts their noses."
               
               
                  We say of one a little too officious,
                  Prying and peering with unblushing face,
                  "He puts his nose in other people's dishes—
                  He'd better keep it in its proper place!"
                  And when a person very scornful grows,
                  You'd hear it said that he "turns up his nose!"
               
               
                  Our doctrine proved—we now proceed to show
                  How to determine characters at once,
                  That every man with certainty may know
                  Whether a stranger be a sage or dunce,
                  Witty or dull, a courtier or a lout,
                  Just by inspection of a person's snout!
               
               
                  The Roman nose betokens manly sense,
                  The humble Snub bespeaks the modest man,
                  But then 'twill never rise to eminence.
                  The least aspiring of the nasal clan,
                  With but a moderate love of fame or pelf—
                  (I've got, they say, a snubbish nose myself.)
               
               
                  The Aquiline proclaims the keenest wit,
                  But full of guile as any hawk—or hawker!
                  The Turn up nose—as ancient Horace writ—
                  Is everywhere a scorner and a mocker,
                  Some crooked end it certainly proposes—
                  Don't hang your hats nor hopes on turn up noses
               
               
                  The Bottle nose is commonly a feature
                  One doesn't from paternal blood inherit;
                  And hence discloses not so much the nature
                  Of mind and soul, as of some other "spirit!"
                  Its meaning, therefore, is of small avail,
                  As in at droughty time the "sign" must fail.
               
               
                  
               
               
                  The Gimlet nose betrays an intermeddler;
                  Whene'er you see a gimlet nose, before ye,
                  It augurs that some new opinion pedler,
                  Or "special agent" now intends to bore you,
                  The very chap who, when he pricks your oint,
                  With hideous smile, cries, "don't you see the point?"
               
               
                  Observe the point?—ye gods!—of course you do;
                  You see it all transparently enough,
                  And worse than that, he'll make you feel it too.
                  If you are "made of penetrable stuff"
                  You'd better far encounter, on my word,
                  A tailor's needle or a Taylor's sword!
               
            
            
               
               "THE BLESSED BABBIES!" OR, THE FAMILY OINTMENT.
               AN ORIGINAL TALE OF DEEP DOMESTIC INTEREST.
               
                  
               
               
                  ALTHOUGH your lot be care or strife,
                  Be this your maxim e'er through life,—
                  Content and patience, resignation,
                  Whate'er your fate, whate'er your station;
                  And so, the same to illustrate,
                  A simple story I'll relate:
               
               
                  In a snug house, not far from town,
                  Resided Mr. Abraham Brown,
                  Who'd all the comforts of this life;
                  But chief of all, a charming wife—
                  A gentle partner, loving mate—
                  A being formed to captivate.
                  They loved each other fondly, truly,
                  Though sometimes they would both complain,
                  And tantalize and quarrel duly,
                  For th' joy of making it up again.
                  Now, 'tis a rule,
                  We're taught at school,
                  'Tis heaven's decree, who will deny?
                  Man's sent below—
                  Who'll gainsay, No?—
                  When wed, to increase and multiply,
                  This truth I hardly need to mention;
                  But that the cause of all the strife
                  Between our hero and his wife,—
                  The mainspring of the whole contention,—
                  'Bout which they quarrell'd like two tabbies
                  Three years they'd Hymen's fetters borne,
                  Yet with regret their minds were torn,
                  Because they had no "blessed babbies!"
               
               
                  For this one blessing, how they sigh'd!
                  But still to them it was denied;
                  And how they envied the hard lot
                  Of those who'd half a dozen got! 
               
               
                  Thus time roll'd on from year to year
                  Without one hope to crush despair;
                  And Brown and wife, both feared, alas!
                  They childless to their graves should pass.
               
               
                  Now, it so happened, Mrs. Brown,
                  One day, the stairs in passing down,
                  Slipp'd, and you will not be amaz'd,
                  That she her shin severely graz'd.
               
               
                  'Twas very bad, each day grew worse,
                  She tried to walk about, in vain;
                  She kept her bed, and hired a nurse,
                  And felt excruciating pain.
                  The doctor's skill is quite defied,
                  Various remedies they tried,
                  But all in vain.
               
               
                  Poor Mr. Brown was craz'd, or nigh,
                  When scanning the Daily —— one day,
                  
                  An "Ad.," conspicuous, met his eye,
                  So he perus'd it then straightway.
                  'Twas one of HOLLOWAY'S, and it held,
                  For wounds or sores
                  Each one deplores,
                  Rheumatic gout,
                  Without a doubt,—
                  His "Family Ointment" all excelled.
               
               
                  The "Ad." flashed hope upon Brown's brain,
                  Again he read it, and again;
                  There was a charm about the name,
                  Which to his soul like balsam came.
                  "The Family Ointment!" he'd try its use
                  Who knew the effect it might produce?
                  Elate with hope, he went straightway
                  (Fearful of any more delay,)
                  Unto the patient's room, and then,
                  To her the advertisement read again.
                  Now Mrs. Brown, with pain half-mad,
                  At prospects of relief was glad;
                  So off went Brown
                  By rail to town,
                  And with all haste unto the Strand,
                  For he was given to understand,
                  There was the ointment to be had,
                  A dozen boxes there he bought,
                  Because he very wisely thought,
                  Its qualities he'd fairly try,
                  By laying in a good supply.
               
               
                  Without delay, his wife applied
                  Th' remedy to th' affected part,
                  Rubb'd it well in; 'tis not denied
                  It caus'd the wounded shin to smart;
                  And a sensation, (she declared,)
                  All through her system, as appeared.
               
               
                  Six times a day, for a week or more
                  She used the ointment to the sore;
                  Its good effects were soon reveal'd,
                  She felt relief, the wound was heal'd.
               
               
                  To Holloway both grateful were,
                  And spoke his praises far and near;
                  But Mrs. B. was stunned, you'll guess,
                  When, with a blush and smile of glee,
                  His lovely wife, sweet Mrs. B.,
                  One morning did to him confess—
                  We'll not repeat her words,—
                  Let it suffice, howe'er, that she
                  Was in a way "that ladies wish to be,
                  Who love their lords!"
               
               
                  Brown was delighted and astounded;
                  His spouse, though pleased, not less confounded,
                  Time placed the fact beyond a doubt.
                  Their cares and sorrows all were past—
                  Their hopes would realiz'd be at last—
                  The leg got well, and Mrs. B. got stout.
               
               
                  Then, how affectionate was B.
                  Unto the partner of his joys!
                  No man was half so kind as he!
                  Fond visions haunted both their brains
                  Of half-a-dozen girls or boys
                  To soothe their pains.
                  The doctor and the nurse were hired
                  Long ere their services were required;
                  And baby linen, too, prepared,
                  Which females, young and old, declared,
                  Its value to enhance,
                  That for taste, elegance, and value,—ay,
                  'Twas not too much to say,
                  And everybody coincided,—
                  It equall'd that which was provided
                  For the imperial babe of France;—
                  That is, the same they would have vow'd
                  But then, of course, it must be allow'd
                  They couldn't do so then, 'tis flat,
                  For one good reason why,
                  Which no one can deny,
                  They hadn't a chance:
                  The Prince of France
                  
                  Was not born till a long time after that.
                  However, I've no wish to bore ye,
                  So 'thus proceed I with my story.
               
               
                  The weeks and months so quick take wing.
                  And now appears sweet smiling Spring
                  When nature looks so fresh and gay,
                  Clothed in its newest, best array,
                  And various budding flowers are seen
                  To deck the hills and valleys green;
                  And song-birds, from each leafy spray,
                  All carol forth their sweetest lay.
                  Balmy fragrance fills the air,
                  And Nature's smiles are ev'rywhere—
                  Those heaven-wrought smiles, that shine and glow,
                  And life, and health on man bestow.
               
               
                  Pardon, kind readers, this digression,
                  I fear I'm getting too poetic;
                  Still the description I've essay'd,
                  You'll all agree, I'm not afraid,
                  Though rather romantic in expression,
                  Is not too grave or too pathetic.
                  Well, it was spring—you'll understand,—
                  And from certain symptoms it was clear—
                  To doctor and nurse it did appear,—
                  And so they said to Mr. B.,
                  To quiet his anxiety:
                  The all-important moment was at hand.
               
               
                  'Twas evening. Rack'd with hopes and fears,
                  Pensively Brown sat himself down-stairs;
                  Anxiously watching nurse to appear,
                  That the result he then might hear.
                  And Mr. B.
                  Was fidgetty.
                  He tried to think, but all in vain,
                  Then his cigar he smok'd again,
                  And sipp'd his wine—took up a book,
                  And fix'd on the title a vacant look.
                  The subject was not mirth-inspiring,—
                  To some of interest, to be sure;
                  And one they'd be admiring,
                  "Treatise on the Cold-Water Cure!"
                  "Damn the cold-water cure!" cried B.,
                  "Brandy-and-water, hot, for me!"
                  He might have said more,
                  Had not the parlor door,
                  Just at that moment open'd in great haste;
                  And, no longer the reader's time to waste
                  (No doubt our prolix style he'll curse),
                  Not much to his surprise,
                  Before Brown's anxious eyes,
                  Stood the nurse;—
                  With smiling face, and glistening eye,
                  Which seemed glad tidings to imply.
               
               
                  
               
               
                  Up jumped Brown,—"Now, nurse, quick—pray,
                  How's the dear patient? tell me,—say?"
                  "Sweet, blessed lady, it's all over;—"
                  "All over"
                  "Yes; and you may think yourself in clover,—
                  
                  I give you joy,
                  Missus has got,—"
                  "What, nurse, what?"
                  "A bootiful little boy!"
                  "Good!—good, by Jupiter!" cried B.;
                  And then he laugh'd and wept with glee.
                  "The blessed,—darling little babby!—
                  Here, good nurse, I'll not act shabby,—
                  I'm not a man of wealth,
                  But here's a pound—
                  To drink the little new-come's health!"
               
               
                  With many thanks, nurse left the room,
                  And Brown his seat did then resume.
                  Anxiously waiting,
                  'Tis as well to be stating,—
                  Indeed, it should not be omitted,
                  Nurse's return,
                  That he might learn
                  How his lady was progressing,
                  Likewise their little blessing,
                  And when to her chamber he might be admitted.
               
               
                  Nurse came again, and you might trace
                  Nothing but smiles all o'er her face.
                  "Well, nurse, what news? how's my little queen?"
                  "I give you double joy, sir,—"
                  "What do you mean?—"
                  "It's all over again, sir,—charming! prime!
                  
                     Missus has got a little girl this time!"
                  "Good again! by jingo!—" shouted B.,
                  "Was ever such a lucky fellow as me?
                  Here's another pound, nurse,—no oration,
                  This is an extraordinary occasion;—
                  Of cash I can afford to stand some,
                  I like to do the thing that's handsome!"
               
               
                  Nurse curtsey'd, and then walk'd away,
                  Wishing, if that was to be the pay,—
                  That Mrs. B.,—the truth I speak
                  (Though such a thing would be uncommon,
                  For any woman),—
                  Would keep the game alive for a week!—
                  Brown felt delighted, boundless was his joy,
                  The happy father of a girl and boy!—
                  But ere he had time to give his feelings vent,
                  Open flew the door,
                  The nurse appear'd once more!
                  Brown wondered what this meant.
                  "Now, nurse; now, nurse,—how goes it, eh?"
                  "Bootiful!—couldn't be better, I say.
                  A third time, sir, I have to wish you joy,
                  
                     Missus has got another little boy!"
                  "Good again!—keep the game alive!—
                  This is the way to live and thrive!—
                  Beat this, my Trojans, if you can,
                  HOLLOWAY, you're a wonderful man!—
                  Here's food for gossip for old tabbies;
                  God bless the blessed little babbies!
                  There nurse!—another pound, away!
                  And see to your tender charge without delay."
                  The nurse quick vanish'd at the door,
                  Brown thought the business now all o'er;
                  Not so,—for to his great surprise,
                  Nurse stood a fourth time 'fore his eyes.
                  He was astounded, you'll be sure,
                  When, with a wicked leer,
                  Thinking his soul to cheer,
                  She announced the birth of number four!
                  
                  "Damn'd bad!" this time, cried Brown,
                  Reseating himself with a fling;—
                  "I wanted brats, I own,
                  But this with my fancy don't exactly chime,
                  I did not bargain for four at a time,
                  It's rather too much of a good thing!
                  I must see my wife,—nurse, don't scoff,—
                  I must remonstrate, or, curse me, she'll ne'er leave off!"
                  "Lawks, sir," cried nurse, "how can you wonder so?
                  It's all owing to the Family Ointment you know."
               
               
                  Brown did not offer to say nay,
                  But to his lady went straightway;
                  And Mrs. B., you may be sure,
                  
                  With pride presented babbies four.
                  They form'd a little juvenile party,
                  Fine children too and well and hearty.
                  
                     
                  
                  The boys the image of papa,
                  The girls the picture of mamma! 
                  "But, my dear," said Brown, "you're rather fast,
                  I think our prayers are heard at last;
                  I wish'd for children, it is true,—
                  One at a time, or even two,
                  Nay, three, p'rhaps, might not be amiss,
                  But I bargain'd not for a lot like this!"
                  "My dear," she said, with a kiss of love,
                  Meant at the same time to reprove
                  "Do not complain,
                  For that is vain,
                  The proverb says, and well you know it,
                  So, there's no occasion, perhaps, to show it,
                  Although it should never be forgot,
                  You must be contented with your lot!
                  
                  But then, at one time, to be sure,
                  Rather too many, perhaps, is four!
                  
                  Mind not," she cried, and him caress'd,
                  "Dear Abraham!—now you're four times blessed!
                  
                  "Five hundred times, my angel, true!
                  I'm bless'd, in having these and you!"
                  Cried Brown, as with a loving kiss,
                  Upon her lips he seal'd his bliss.
                  "Go on!—a go, don't ever call,
                  Damme! there's room enough for all!
                  
                  Dear HOLLOWAY!—your Ointment's praise
                  I'll gladly speak in, all my days.
                  For, I believe, howe'er 't may be,
                  It's made a family man of me!"
               
               
                  He ceas'd, with joy embraced his wife,
                  Then kiss'd the "blessed babbies" round,
                  And I'll be bound,
                  That from that day,
                  So all who know them say,
                  They're the happiest couple to be found in life.
               
               
                  
               
            
            
               
               "A PINCH OF SNUFF."
               
                  THE luckless fate of inventors and originators has become proverbial, but
                  the luckless individual whose nostrils rejoiced in the first pinch of snuff, stood
                  in no need of the niggardly praise of contemporaries, or the lavish gratitude of
                  posterity. That first "pinch" was its own priceless reward, far above present
                  appreciation or future fame. What matters it, that his great name has not been
                  reverently handed down to us: that posterity seeks in vain his honored tomb, on
                  which to hang her grateful votive wreath: that zealous antiquaries have raised up
                  innumerable pretenders to his unclaimed honors, and striven to rob him of his
                  fame? Enough for that lucky inventor wherever he may rest, that he enjoyed in his
                  lifetime the reward for which ordinary benefactors of their kind are fain to look
                  to the future.
               It is perfectly vain to attempt now to penetrate into the mystery which envelopes
                  the name and nation of the first snuff-taker: long before rough, noble-hearted
                  Drake cured his dyspepsia by the use of tobacco, or Raleigh transplanted some
                  roots of that precious weed into English soil, there were European noses which had
                  rejoiced at its pulverised leaves. Conjecture, lost in the mazy distance, gladly
                  lays hold of something substantial in the shape of snuff's first royal patron.
                  This was Catherine de Medicis, who, receiving some seeds of the tobacco plant from
                  a Dutch colony, cherished them, and elevated the dried and pounded leaves into a
                  royal medicine, with the proud title of "Herbe à la Reine." For in the beginning
                  men took snuff, not as an everyday luxury, but as a medicament. Like tea—which a
                  hundred years later was advertised as a cure for every ill—the new sneezing powder
                  was hailed as an universal specific, and so pleasant in its operation, that
                  mankind, acting upon the wholesome aphorism that prevention is better than cure,
                  eagerly anticipated the disease it was supposed to remedy.
               The use of "the pungent grains of titillating dust" received a somewhat heavy and
                  discouraging blow from an unexpected quarter. That ubiquitous power which hurled
                  anathemas alike at the heresies of Luther and the length of clerical wigs,
                  discountenanced its use, and at length fairly lost its temper in the contest with
                  snuff. Whether from a prescience of the beneficial influence it was destined to
                  exert upon mankind, or from a suspicion of its power of sharpening obtuse
                  intellects, it is difficult to say; but Popes Urban VIII. and Innocent waged quite
                  a miniature crusade against snuff, anathematizing those who should use it in any
                  church, and positively threatening with excommunication all impious persons who
                  should provoke a profane sneeze within the sacred precincts of St. Peter's pile.
                  Louis XIV., that good son of the Church, filially complied with the paternal
                  injunction, but his courtiers were less yielding; and the gilded antechambers of
                  Versailles frequently resounded with the effects of the pleasant stimulant. All
                  persecution has a distinct tendency to establish the object of its hate, and so it
                  was with the subject of our article—it only required to be known to be loved; and
                  I do not doubt that, had circumstances required them, snuff would have found its
                  martyrs.
               Its use was not general in England until Charles II. introduced it, upon his
                  return from exile, with other important fashions. It had been known and used
                  before, as had the periwig, but it was not until his reign that it became common.
                  When the Stuarts relieved the country of their presence for the second and last
                  time, it had become firmly established, and, by the days of good Queen Anne, was
                  such a necessary of life, that there were, in the metropolis alone, no less than
                  seven thousand shops where the snuff boxes of the Londoners could be replenished.
                  At that time indeed gallants were as proud of their jewelled boxes of amber,
                  porcelain, ebony, and agate, as they were of their flowing wigs and clouded canes,
                  the handles of which were not unfrequently constructed to hold the cherished dust.
                  We are told by courtly Dick Steele, that a handsome snuff box was as much an
                  essential of "the fine gentleman," as his gilt chariot, diamond ring, and brocade
                  sword-knot. We know them to have been manufactured of the costliest material,
                  heavy with gold, and brilliant with jewels, as they needed to be when their
                  masters carried wigs "high on the shoulder in a basket borne," worth forty or
                  fifty guineas, and wore enough Flanders lace upon their persons to have stocked a
                  milliner's stall in the New Exchange. Unfortunately, but very naturally, this
                  extravagance rendered snuff a butt for the wits (who all took it by the way) to
                  shoot at. Steele, whose weakness for dress and show was proverbial, levelled many
                  of his blunt shafts at its use; and Pope, who himself tells us of "his wig all
                  powder, and all snuff his band," let fly one of his keener arrows at the beaux, whose wit lay in
                  their snuff boxes and tweezer cases.
               As the world laid by, in the Georgian era, much of the magnificence of their
                  attire, so their snuff- boxes became plainer, and decidedly uglier. Rushing into
                  an opposite extreme, the most outrageous receptacles for the precious dust were
                  devised. Boxes in the shape of bibles, boats, shoes, toads, and coffins, outraged
                  good taste. The strangest materials were used in their construction, the public
                  taste leaning towards relics possessing an historical interest. Thus the mulberry
                  tree planted by Shakespere, the hull of the Royal George, in which "brave
                  Kempenfelt went down, with twice four hundred men" and the deck of the Victory, on
                  which Nelson died "for England, home, and beauty," have alone been supposed to
                  provide material for snuff boxes to an extent which, if known, must considerably
                  weaken the faith of their possessors in their genuineness.
               Nor has snuff itself been less liable to the rule of fashion than the boxes that
                  held it. We will give a few familiar instances. In the naval engagement of Viga,
                  in 1703, when a large Spanish fleet was taken or destroyed, a great quantity of
                  musty snuff was made prize of, and patriotism ran high enough to cause the "town,"
                  for some length of time, to resist all that was not manufactured to imitate the
                  flavor from which it took its well-known name of "musty." Nearer to our own time,
                  a large tobacco warehouse having been destroyed by fire, in Dublin, a poor man
                  purchased some of the scorched or damaged stock, and, manufacturing it into coarse
                  snuff, sold it to the poorer class of snuff-takers. Forthwith capricious fashion
                  adopted, endowing it with fabulous qualities, and Lundy Foot's Irish Blackguard
                  (so it was termed) filled the most fashionable boxes. Again, during the Peninsular
                  campaigns, in which the Light Division of the British army bore so memorable a
                  part, the mixture used by and called after its gallant leader, General Sir Amos
                  Norcott, had a more extensive sale than any other. When Napoleon was at Elba, and
                  folks began to tire of legitimacy, as they soon did, it became fashionable to use
                  snuff scented with the spirit of violet, and significantly to allude to the
                  perfume. Garrick, when he was manager of the Drury Lane Theatre, brought a mixture
                  into fashion by using and alluding to it in one of his most famous parts. The
                  tobacconist whom he thus favored was his under-treasurer Hardham, whom no writer
                  about snuff should omit to notice. He was a great favorite with Garrick, whom in
                  his turn he almost revered. One of Hardham's most important duties was to number
                  the house from a hole in the curtain above the stage; and it is amusing to fancy
                  the little tobacconist, snuff-box in hand, calmly watching the pit fill, or from
                  his elevated position admiring the histrionic talents of his gifted patron. His
                  shop in Fleet street is also memorable. It was the general resort of theatrical
                  men and tyros, who sought to reach the manager through his subordinate, and his
                  little back parlor witnessed the début of many
                  who afterwards gained applause from larger, yet not more exacting audiences. Her
                  Majesty Queen Charlotte has bequeathed her name to a once favorite mixture, and
                  George the Fourth has some slight chance of being remembered by the famous
                  "Prince's Mixture," which was so popular when it was the fashion to admire and
                  imitate that gifted individual.
               It would be a grateful, but almost an impossible task to enumerate the kings,
                  soldiers, lawyers, poets, and actors, who have sought from and found in the snuff
                  box comfort and inspiration. Prominent among the rulers of the earth who have
                  acknowledged the pleasing influence of snuff, is Frederick the Great. His
                  snuff-box was the pocket of the long waistcoats of that period, in which he kept
                  large quantities loose—a dirty habit which Napoleon, who was a great plagiarist,
                  adopted. It would be easy to draw out a famous list of literary names attached to
                  snuff, beginning with Dryden, who was particular enough to manufacture his own
                  mixture, and selfish enough to preserve the secret of its excellence, with the
                  view, probably, of enhancing the value of the pinch from his box, for which the
                  beaux and wits at Will's intrigued. In the pulpit, at the bar, and on the stage,
                  snuff has been equally valuable in adding to the persuasive eloquence and talent
                  of its patrons. By the female portion of human kind it was at one time generally
                  taken, nor was it uncommon for even young and pretty women to offer and accept a
                  pinch in public. After the gentle sex had to a great extent given up the habit,
                  some strong-minded females were to be found who retained it. Mrs. Siddons, when
                  she came off the stage, after dying, hard as Desdemona, or harrowing the hearts of
                  her audience by her representation of Jane Shore, would composedly ask those
                  around her for a pinch of the precious restorative.
               When we consider the beneficial influence which snuff has exerted over mankind
                  generally, we cannot help regretting that its virtues were not sooner known. For
                  we put forth the proposition seriously that its effect upon the world has been to
                  render it more humane and even-tempered, and that had the western hemisphere
                  discovered the tobacco plant earlier, historians would have had more pleasant
                  stories to chronicle. For instance, is it not possible—nay, most probable—that
                     the fate of Rome, discussed by the
                  Triumvirate, over their snuff-boxes, would have been different? Is it likely, that
                  under the humanizing influence of mutual pinches, Antony would have asked for, or
                  Augustus resigned the head of Cicero to his bloodthirsty colleague; or that the
                  other details of the conscription, which deluged the streets of Rome with the
                  blood of her best citizens, would have been agreed to? Again, can any one imagine
                  Charles the Ninth and his evil counsellors plotting the massacre of St.
                  Bartholomew over pinches of the soothing dust? Is it probable that the High Court
                  of Justice would have entitled its royal martyr to a special service in the Book
                  of Common Prayer, if its deliberation had been inspired by the kindly snuff which
                  since that time has so often softened the vigor of the law? My hypothesis may seem
                  an absurd one, but history supports it. When Charles the Second introduced snuff
                  into general use, men's hands had scarcely adapted themselves to more peaceful
                  occupations than cutting their neighbors' throats, and the ashes of a long and
                  bitter civil war needed little fanning to break into a blaze again; and yet, for
                  forty years of misgovernment, the nation kept its temper. How can this forbearance
                  be accounted for? Was it that circumstances no longer called for as stern and as
                  effectual remedies as before? No. Was the second Charles one whit more desirable
                  than the first of that ilk?—was Clarendon more liked than Stafford?—was Russell's
                  head of less consequence than Prynne's ears? No. Again, wrongs as grievous as
                  those which Hampden had died in resisting were to be avenged, but in a milder,
                  better fashion; for mankind had in the meanwhile learned to take snuff. Much of
                  the haste and irritation, which had previously led to blows, discharged itself in
                  a good-natured sneeze. Snuff made men forbearing, even jocular over their wrongs.
                  Who can doubt that the revolution which ended in placing William of Orange on his
                  father-in-law's throne, owed its bloodless character not a little to the influence
                  of snuff? We read of difficulties in its course, which, fifty years previously,
                  would have inevitably led to bloodshed, being easily, almost numerously,
                  surmounted. The plagued nation effected a revolution over its snuff-boxes in the
                  happiest conceivable manner.
               Having ventured so far, I am inclined to put forward a yet higher claim which
                  snuff has upon our gratitude, and to hint that the, great deeds of great men who
                  were snuff-takers may be traced by a chain of reasoning—slight, yet conclusive—to
                  this their dearly prized luxury. The hackneyed saying that time is money, or
                  money's worth, has more truth in it than most of the fallacies which are supposed
                  to regulate our conduct. The most important events of our lives often hinge on
                  moments. A moment to stifle passion—to summon reflection—to plunge into the past,
                  and bring up a buried memory—to consider results—is often of the utmost
                  consequence, and this valued moment the pinch of snuff ensures, when, without it,
                  delay would be simply embarrassment. The pinch of snuff taken at the right instant
                  secures an important reprieve, during which the unpleasant question may be
                  evaded—the hasty reply reconsidered—or the angry repartee thought better of—while the same time gained serves to
                  improve the diplomatist's equivoque, to point the orator's satire, and polish the
                  wit's mot. In a word its use on important
                  occasions affords, to every one who needs them, better means of acting upon
                  Talleyrand's mischievous yet clever aphorism—that language is useful rather to
                  conceal than to express our thoughts. Moreover, the action necessary in conveying
                  the tempting graces to their destination has not unfrequently been found useful.
                  It employs the hasty hand that may itch to take illegal  vengeance for
                  fancied insult; it serves to hide the angrily twitching mouth and passionately 
                     expaading
                     expanding
                   nostrils, to give a natural expression to changes of the countenance,
                  which would otherwise indicate emotion, and to parry attention till reason has
                  been summoned to supplant passion.
               
               It is denied (in a rather irritating way sometimes) that the subject of our
                  article has any beneficial influence upon the intellects of its patrons. We are
                  not about to claim for it any such exalted qualities, but we may be allowed to
                  mention a fact or so which entitle it to some respect medicinally. As we have
                  before stated, in its early days it was considered to possess powerful healing
                  qualities, and, even now, is found of use in cases of headache and weak sight. It
                  was also supposed valuable in cases of heaviness and obtuseness of intellect. Is
                  it, therefore, unreasonable to presume that it may have had some share in gaining
                  for our brethren beyond the Tweed that shrewdness of national character which has
                  become proverbial? The specimens which came in the train of James I. southward did
                  not command much respect or admiration from our country men; indeed they were the
                  butts at which every satirist hurled his shafts, and blunt must have been that one
                  which did not pierce some patent folly of language or manner. The town rang with
                  anecdotes of their rags, beggary, and quarrels; ballad-singers made merry at their
                  expense, and the stage resounded with uncomplimentary allusions. Indeed, in one of
                  the most popular plays of that period, the king, himself was not spared, and the
                  actors (Ben Jonson among them) had very nearly lost their ears for their boldness.
                  Nor was it until, at least, a hundred and fifty years after this period that the
                  Scotch became noted for that enterprise and talent which now distinguish them. We
                  do not deny that the union may have developed their traits, but it is clear that
                  within that time snuff had become a national stimulant.
               To the observer of men and manners there is something very characteristic in the
                  various fashions in which the pinch of snuff is taken. "The exercise of the
                  snuff-box," as it was once termed, was an acknowledged science, but few were the
                  great proficients who could mutely express their feelings by its aid. We have not
                  space to run through all its exercises, but we may mention the "pinch military,"
                  which Frederick, and, after him, Napoleon practised—inhaling snuff copiously, and
                  with much waste, as though it were human life they were throwing away; the "pinch
                  malicious," of which Pope was perfect master; the "pinch dictatorial," which burly
                  Johnson established; the "pinch sublimely contemptuous," such as Reynolds took
                  when some travelled virtuoso hinted at excellence away from Leicestersquare, and
                  ruffled his complacent vanity: and, above all, the "pinch politic," which
                  Talleyrand understood so well.
               From snuff to sneezing is but a step, which we purpose taking before we bring this
                  cursory article to a close. The act of sneezing appears to have been variously
                  regarded at various stages of the world's history, but, from the earliest times of
                  which we have any authentic record, it  has been the custom of those
                  around to give vent to a short benediction immediately upon its commission. The
                  Rabbins considering themselves bound to find a reason for this universal custom,
                  and being hard pressed, gave the somewhat incomprehensible explanation that,
                  previous to Jacob, man sneezed but once in his lifetime, and then immediately
                  before death; so that those around, warned of his imminent journey, hastened to
                  wish it a good termination. How it was that Jacob instituted a new order of things
                  we are not told, but as a proof of the truth of their assertion they give the fact
                  that in all nations of the earth a similar custom will be found existing.
                  Strangely enough this assertion was corroborated by the first colonists of
                  America, who discovered the habit in common use amongst the aboriginal tribes. The
                  Greeks and Romans certainly had a similar habit, but far from attaching any ill
                  omen to the sneeze, they regarded it as of good augury. Thus Catullus assures us,
                  that when Cupid upon a memorable occasion sneezed, all 
                     
                        "The little loves that waited by
                        Bowed and blessed the augury."
                     
                   And in his Life of Themistocles, Plutarch informs his readers that sneezing,
                  by the general on the eve of a battle was regarded as a certain sign of
                  conquest.
               Strangely enough we find that, in comparatively modern times, the custom of
                  giving, expression to good wishes when a friend sneezed was attributed to the
                  fearful plague which periodically swept over Europe Sneezing was one of its first and most dangerous
                  symptoms, and those who were by, as they gathered their robes about them, and fled
                  from their doomed fellow-creature, would ejaculate a quick "God bless you,"
                  hurriedly invoking from a more merciful quarter the aid they feared to give.
                  Violent sneezing was not only among the first, but was one of the last fatal signs
                  of that fearful scourge, and was often too rapidly followed by death to give time
                  for more than a short benediction.
               
                  
               
               Anyhow, the custom still exists, and one of the most pleasant reminiscences
                  attached to the first pinch of snuff is the chorus of hearty good wishes of
                  sympathizing friends which follows upon the inevitable sneeze.
            
            
               THE SKELETON IN THE CUPBOARD.
               A TALE OF CRINOLINE.
               IT was nigh midnight. Mrs. Mountbrown, with three of her lovely daughters,
                  attended by her son Augustus, was on the point of starting for an evening party,
                  there, at the behest of Fashion, to sacrifice to Terpsichore those hours which
                  ought, alas! to be devoted to Morpheus.
               "I am so sorry, dear," said Mrs. Mountbrown to her eldest and loveliest daughter,
                  "that you can't go."
               "Never mind, Ma," said the interesting Bertha. She was resigned, but pale. The
                  bloom had deserted her cheek to settle, in a hectic spot, on the extremity of a
                  more prominent feature. It was such a pity! She had a bad cold.
               "Have some Eau-de-Cologne on your handkerchief, Ma," suggested Bertha, unselfishly
                  interested in her parent's preparation for that gaiety, which was denied to her
                  own heart. "It's in my bed-room, on the drawers. Run up for it, Betsy, quick." The
                  obedient girl left the room, taking with her the candle that she had been holding
                  to the lady's-maid. Betsy was a maid-of-all-work, who had been in the house about
                  a week, and in London first in her life, for the same time. She was an untutored
                  native of that forest wild, in which the arrow of the careless Pyrrel gored the
                  bosom of the unguarded Rufus.
               A minute had scarcely elapsed when a loud and violent shriek was heard overhead, a
                  rapid and floundering step descended the stairs, and Betsy, pale with terror,
                  rushed into the room, plunging among the party like a skittle-ball, and knocking
                  them down like so many pins. The comparison may be odious, but it is expressive. A
                  drawing-room table also was upset in the general tumble, and the books and albums
                  with which it was loaded were sent flying into space. A lamp which cost thirty
                  guineas had fortunately been placed on the mantel-shelf.
               "Oh! 'm!" screamed Betsy, regardless of the general cries of indignant
                  astonishment attending the catastrophe she had created, "Oh, Miss! Oh lor! I see
                  it—I see it!"
               "See! see what? What do you see?" cried the party, in amazement and unison.
               "I see it, mum, as plain as I sees you and the young ladies. Ugh!" And the poor
                  girl shuddered with inexpressible horror.
               "Nonsense, you silly creature. What is it that has frightened you so out of your
                  wits?" angrily demanded her mistress.
               "The Ottomis, 'm! Ugh!" exclaimed Betsy, with another shudder, "the Ottomis"
               "What!"
               "The skellington, 'm—the skellington in the cupboard!"
               "Fiddle-de-dee!" cried Mrs. Mountbrown; whilst her daughters, with a slightly
                  startled expression, ejaculated, "La! What skeleton in what cupboard?"
               "Oh, 'm! the skellington in Miss Bertha's cupboard, 'm. I'd no thoughts it was in
                  that cupboard, 'm. Mrs. Caddy never said as it come out of where it was kep."
               "What stuff has Mrs. Caddy been telling you? She ought to have known better at her
                  time of life; as my housekeeper, too, she should have had more sense."
               "Why, 'm, she said as how there was one cupboard in the house where a skellington
                  was kep; she wouldn't tell me what cupboard it was. 'No,' she said, 'I won't say,' she said, but don't
                  go a openin' none o' the cupboards, and then you won't zee no skellington.'"
               "How very wrong of Mrs. Caddy!" said the lady of the house. "Her motive is
                  good,—to prevent the under-servants from peeping and being tempted to take things;
                  but telling stories is not the right way to prevent dishonesty. I suspect a Jesuit
                  has crept into the house, and made a pervert of Mrs. Caddy, teaching her that the
                  end justifies the means."
               
                  
               
               "Humph!" remarked Augustus, "some other vagabond may perhaps have crept into the
                  house, and frightened Betsy. The skeleton in Bertha's cupboard may be one clothed
                  with flesh, and carrying skeleton keys."
               It was now Mrs. Mountbrown's turn to feel some alarm, in which the young ladies
                  strongly participated. The bell was rung for Thomas, who was summoned from behind
                  the carriage which stood at the door to come up with the kitchen poker. Augustus
                  seized the drawing-room ditto, and ascended the stairs to Bertha's room, Thomas
                  and his young master marching abreast, and the ladies and servant girls
                  following,—Betsy by compulsion, protesting that what she had seen was a bag of
                  bones, and a skull with the eyeholes in it all a-light with blue flame, and as big
                  as cheese plates.
               To satisfy themselves that there was nobody either in the closet or under the bed
                  was the work of a moment to Augustus and the footman; when a general laugh arose
                  at the expense of Betsy, who was told to open her eyes and assure herself that the
                  horror which she imagined she had beheld was all fancy. No sooner had she opened
                  them, however, than she closed them instantly again with a piercing shriek,
                  exclaiming in accents of agonized terror:—
               "There—there a be—there a be still! Don't ye see un?—the skellington in the
                  cupboard!"
               It was as she said. There, from a peg, which some unknown hand had driven into the
                  wall, hung Bertha's Jupon Squelette!!!
               
               Comment would be didactic.
            
            
               AN IRISH HIGHWAYMAN.
               
                  
                  A Bishop of Cashel, having occasion to visit Dublin, accompanied by
                  his wife and daughter, determined to perform the journey by easy stages, in his
                  own carriage, and with his own sleek and well-fed horses, instead of trusting his
                  bones to the tender mercies of an Irish post-chaise, and the unbroken garrons used for drawing these crazy vehicles.
               One part of his route was through a wild and mountainous district; and the bishop,
                  being a very humane man, and considerate of his cattle, made a point of quitting
                  his carriage at the foot of every hill and walking to the top. On one of these
                  occasions he had loitered to look at the extensive prospect, indulging in a
                  reverie upon its sterile appearance, and the change that agriculture might
                  produce, and in so doing suffered his
                  family and servants to be considerably in advance, perceiving this he hastened to
                  make up for lost time, and was stepping out with his best speed when a fellow
                  leaped from behind a heap of loose stones, and accompanying the flourish of a huge
                  club with a demoniac yell, demanded "Money!" with a ferocity of tone and manner
                  perfectly appalling.
               The bishop gave the robber all the silver he had loose in his pocket, hoping that
                  it would satisfy him; but he was mistaken, for no sooner had the ruffian stowed it
                  away in a capacious rent in his tattered garment, than with another whirl of his
                  bludgeon, and an awful oath, he exclaimed—
               "And is it with the likes of this I'm after letting you off? a few paltry
                  tin-pennies! It's the gould I'll have, or I'll spatter your brains. Arrah don't
                  stand shivering and shaking there, like a Quaker in the ague, but lug out your
                  purse, you divil, immediately, or I'll bate you as blue as a whetstone."
               His lordship most reluctantly yielded his well-filled purse, saying in tremulous
                  accents: "My good fellow, there it is, don't ill use me—I've given you all, pray
                  let me depart."
               "Fair and softly, if you plase; as sure as I'm not a good fellow, I
                  haven't done with you yet. I must sarch for your note case, for I'll engage you
                  have a few bits of paper payable at the bank; so hand it over, or you'll sup
                  sorrow to-night."
               It was given up; a glance at the road showed that all hope of assistance from his
                  servants was unavailing, the carriage had disappeared, but the bishop made an
                  instinctive movement as though anxious to escape from further pillage.
               "Wait a while, or may be I shall get angry with you; hand over your watch and
                  sales, and then you may trudge."
               Now it happened that the divine felt a particular regard for his watch—not so much
                  from its being of considerable value, but because it had been presented to him by
                  his first patron—and he ventured to expostulate.
               "Surely you have taken enough; leave me my watch, and I'll forgive all you have
                  done."
               "Who ax'd your forgiveness, you ould varmint? Would you trifle with my
                  good-nature? Don't force me to do anything I'd be sorry for—but without any more
                  bother, just give me the watch, or by all holy—"
               And he jerked the bludgeon from his right hand to his left, spat in the horny palm
                  of the former, and re-grasped the formidable weapon as though seriously bent on
                  bringing it into operation; this action was not unheeded by his victim—he drew
                  forth the golden time-piece, and with a heavy sigh handed it to his spoiler, who,
                  rolling the chain and seals round it, found some wider aperture in his apparel
                  into which he crammed it; and giving himself a shake to ascertain that it had
                  found, by its own gravity, a place of safety, he said—
               "And now be off with you, and thank the blissed saints that you lave me without a
                  scratch on your skin, or the value of your little finger hurt."
               It needed no persuasion to induce the bishop to turn his back upon the despoiler
                  of his worldly goods, and having no weight to carry, he set  off at what
                  equestrians term "a hand canter;" scarcely, however, had he reached the middle of
                  the precipitous road, when he perceived his persecutor running after him. He
                  endeavored to redouble his speed. Alas! what chance had he in a race with one
                  whose muscles were as strong and elastic as highly-tempered steel?
               
               "Stop, you nimble-footed thief of the world!" roared the robber—"stop, I tell you!
                  I've a parting word with you yet."
               The exhausted and defenceless clergyman, finding it impossible to continue his
                  flight, suddenly came to a stand-still. The fellow approached, and his face,
                  instead of its former ferocity, was lit up with a whimsical roguishness of
                  expression, as he said—
               "And is it likely I'd let you off with a better coat on your back than my own? and
                  will I be after losing the chance of that elegant hat and wig? Off with them this
                  moment, and then you'll be quit o' me."
               The footpad quickly divested the bishop of his single-breasted coat—laid violent
                  hands upon the clerical hat and full-bottomed wig—put them on his own person, and
                  then insisted on seeing his late apparel used in their stead; and with a loud
                  laugh ran off, as though his last feat had been the most meritorious in his
                  life.
               Thankful at having escaped with unbroken bones, his lordship was not long in
                  overtaking his carriage; the servants could not repress their laughter at seeing
                  their master in such a strange and motley attire; but there were in his face such
                  evidences of terror and suffering, that they speedily checked their risible
                  inclinations, particularly when they learnt by a few brief words the danger he had
                  undergone. "My dear W——," exclaimed his affectionate wife, after listening to the
                  account of the perils to which her husband had been exposed, "for heaven's sake
                  throw off that filthy jacket, and throw it out of window. You can put my warm
                  cloak over your shoulders till we reach the next stage, and then you will be able
                  to purchase some habit better suited to your station and calling."
               "That is more easily said than done, my love," he replied; "I have lost all the
                  money I possessed; not a single guinea is left me to pay our expenses to-night. My
                  watch, too, that I so dearly prized! Miserable man that I am!"
               "Never mind your watch, or anything else, just now—only pull off that mass of
                  filth, I implore you; who knows what horrid contagion we may all catch if you
                  persist in wearing it?"
               "Take it off, dear papa," observed the daughter, "but don't throw it away; it may
                  lead to the detection of the wretch who robbed you."
               The obnoxious garment was removed; the young lady was about to place it under the
                  seat, when she heard a jingling noise that attracted her attention, and, on
                  examination, found secreted, in various parts of the coat, not only the watch,
                  pocket-book, purse, and silver, of which her father had been deprived, but a
                  yellow canvas bag, such as is used by farmers, containing about thirty
                  guineas.
               The surprise and joy of all parties may be imagined; they reached the inn where
                  they proposed stopping for the night, and as the portmanteaus had escaped the
                  dangers of the road, the bishop was speedily able to attire himself canonically.
                  Before the party retired for rest, intelligence arrived that the highwayman had
                  been taken, after a desperate resistance—the notice of the police being attracted
                  by the singular appearance of a man of his station sporting a new black coat, and
                  covering his shaggy, carroty locks with the well-powdered and orthodox peruke of
                  the right reverend the Bishop of Cashel.
            
            
               THE COUPLE WHO CODDLE THEMSELVES.
               MRS. MERRYWINKLE'S maiden name was Chopper. She was the only child of Mr. and Mrs.
                  Chopper. Her father died when she was, as the play-books express it, "yet an
                  infant;" and so old Mrs. Chopper, when her daughter married, made the house of her
                  son-in-law her home from that time henceforth, and set up her staff of rest with
                  Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle.
               Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle are a couple who coddle themselves; and the venerable
                  Mrs. Chopper is an aider and abettor in the same.
               Mr. Merrywinkle is a rather lean and long-necked gentleman, middle-aged and
                  middle-sized, and usually troubled with a cold in the head. Mrs. Merrywinkle is a
                  delicate-looking lady, with very light hair, and is exceedingly subject to the
                  same unpleasant disorder. The venerable Mrs. Chopper—who is strictly entitled to
                  the appellation, her daughter not being very young, otherwise than by courtesy, at
                  the time of her marriage, which was some years ago—is a mysterious old lady who
                  lurks behind a pair of spectacles, and is afflicted with a chronic disease,
                  respecting which she has taken a vast deal of medical advice, and referred to a
                  vast number of medical books, without meeting any definition of symptoms that at
                  all suits her, or enables her to say, "That's my complaint." Indeed, the absence
                  of authentic information upon the subject of this complaint would seem to be Mrs.
                  Chopper's greatest ill, as in all other respects she is an uncommonly hale and
                  hearty gentlewoman.
               Both Mr. and Mrs. Chopper wear an extraordinary quantity of flannel, and have a
                  habit of putting their feet in hot water to an unnatural extent. They likewise indulge in chamomile tea and
                  such-like compounds, and rub themselves on the slightest provocation with
                  camphorated spirits and other lotions applicable to mumps, sore-throat,
                  rheumatism, or lumbago.
               Mr. Merrywinkle's leaving home to go to business on a damp or wet morning is a
                  very elaborate affair. He puts on wash-leather socks over his stockings, and
                  India-rubber shoes above his boots, and wears under his waistcoat a cuirass of
                  hare-skin. Besides these precautions he winds a thick shawl round his throat, and
                  blocks up his mouth with a large silk handkerchief. Thus accoutred, and furnished
                  besides with a greatcoat and umbrella, he braves the dangers of the streets
                  travelling in severe weather at a gentle trot, the better to preserve the
                  circulation, and bringing his mouth to the surface to take breath, but very
                  seldom, and with the utmost caution. His office-door opened, he shoots past his
                  clerk at the same pace, and diving into his own private room, closes the door,
                  examines the window-fastenings, and gradually unrobes himself: hanging his
                  pocket-handkerchief on the fender to air and determining to write to the
                  newspapers about the fog, which, he says, "has really got to that pitch that it is
                  quite unbearable."
               In this last opinion Mrs. Merrywinkle and her respected mother fully concur; for
                  though not present, their thoughts and tongues are occupied with the same subject,
                  which is their constant theme all day.  If anybody happens to call, Mrs.
                  Merrywinkle opines that they must assuredly be mad, and her first salutation is,
                  "Why, what in the name of goodness can bring you out in such weather? You know you
                     must catch your death." This assurance is corroborated by Mrs.
                  Chopper who adds, in further confirmation, a dismal legend concerning an
                  individual of her acquaintance who, making a call under precisely parallel
                  circumstances, and being then in the best health and spirits, expired in
                  forty-eight hours afterwards, of a complication of inflammatory disorders. The
                  visitor, rendered not altogether comfortable perhaps by this and other precedents,
                  inquires very affectionately after Mr. Merrywinkle, but by so doing brings about
                  no change of the subject; for Mr. Merrywinkle's name is inseparably connected with
                  his complaints, and his complaints are inseparably connected with Mrs.
                  Merrywinkle; and when these are done with, Mrs. Chopper, who has been biding her
                  time, cuts in with the chronic disorder—a subject upon which the amiable old lady
                  never leaves off speaking until she is left alone, and very often not then.
               But Mr. Merrywinkle comes home to dinner. He is received by Mrs. Merrywinkle and
                  Mrs. Chopper, who, on his remarking that he thinks his feet are damp, turn pale as
                  ashes and drag him up stairs, imploring him to have them rubbed directly with a
                  dry coarse towel. Rubbed they are, one by Mrs. Merrywinkle and one by Mrs.
                  Chopper, until the friction causes Mr. Merrywinkle to make horrible faces, and
                  look as if he had been smelling very powerful onions; when they desist, and the
                  patient, provided for his better security with thick worsted stockings and list
                  slippers, is borne down stairs to dinner. Now, the dinner is always a good one,
                  the appetites of the diners being delicate, and requiring a little of what Mrs.
                  Merrywinkle calls "tittivation;" the secret of which is understood to lie in good
                  cookery and tasteful spices, and which process is so successfully performed in the
                  present instance, that both Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle eat a remarkably good dinner,
                  and even the afflicted Mrs. Chopper wields her knife and fork with much of the
                  spirit and elasticity of youth. But Mr. Merrywinkle, in his desire to gratify his
                  appetite, is not unmindful of his health, for he has a bottle of carbonate of soda
                  with which to qualify his porter, and a little pair of scales in which to weigh it
                  out. Neither in his anxiety to take care of his body is he unmindful of the
                  welfare of his immortal part, as he always prays that for what he is going to
                  receive he may be made truly thankful, and in order that he may be as thankful as
                  possible, eats and drinks to the utmost.
               Either from eating and drinking so much, or from being the victim of this
                  constitutional infirmity among others, Mr. Merrywinkle, after two or three glasses
                  of wine, falls fast asleep; and he has scarcely closed his eyes, when Mrs.
                  Merrywinkle and Mrs. Chopper fall asleep likewise. It is on awakening at tea-time that their most alarming symptoms
                  prevail; for then Mr. Merrywinkle feels as if his temples were tightly bound round
                  with the chain of the street-door, and Mrs. Merrywinkle as if she had made a
                  hearty dinner of half-hundred-weights, and Mrs. Chopper as if cold water were
                  running down her back, and oyster-knives with sharp points were plunging of their
                  own accord into her ribs. Symptoms like these are enough to make people peevish,
                  and no wonder that they remain so until supper-time, doing little more than doze
                  and complain, unless Mr. Merrywinkle calls out very loud to a servant "to keep
                  that draught out," or rushes into the passage to flourish his fist in the
                  countenance of the twopenny-postman, for daring to give such a knock as he had
                  just performed at the door of a private gentleman with nerves.
               
                  
               
               Supper, coming after dinner, should consist of some gentle provocative; and
                  therefore the tittivating art is again in requisition, and again done honor to by
                  Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle, still comforted and abetted by Mrs. Chopper. After
                  supper, it is ten to one but the last-named old lady becomes worse, and is led off
                  to bed with the chronic complaint in full vigor. Mr. and Mrs. Merrywinkle, having
                  administered to her a warm cordial, which is something of the strongest, then
                  repair to their own room, where Mr. Merrywinkle, with his legs and feet in hot
                  water, superintends the mulling of some wine which he is to drink at the very
                  moment he plunges into bed; while Mrs. Merrywinkle, in garments whose nature is
                  unknown to and unimagined by all but married men, takes four small pills with a
                  spasmodic look between each, and finally comes to something hot and fragrant out
                  of another little saucepan, which serves as her composing-draught for the
                  night.
               There is another kind of couple who coddle themselves, and who do so at a cheaper
                  rate and on more spare diet, because they are niggardly and parsimonious; for
                  which reason they are kind enough to coddle their visitors too. It is unnecessary
                  to describe them, for our readers may rest assured of the accuracy of these
                  general principles:—that all couples who coddle themselves are selfish and
                  slothful,—that they charge upon every wind that blows, every rain that falls, and
                  every vapor that hangs in the air, the evils which arise from their own imprudence
                  or the gloom which is engendered in their own tempers—and that all men and women,
                  in couples or otherwise, who fall into exclusive habits of self-indulgence, and
                  forget their natural sympathy and close connexion with everybody and everything in
                  the world around them, not only neglect the first duties of life, but, by a happy
                  retributive justice, deprive themselves of its truest and best enjoyment.
            
            
               JIM SMALL'S PAINTER HUNT.
               JIM SMALL is a hatchet-faced, hawk-billed chap, but that doesn't prevent him from
                  being a clever fellow. I met him last summer at the "Pint." Said I, "how do you
                  do, Jim?"
               "Howdy!" said he. He was tolerably shy, and looked uneasy; I knew what ailed, but
                  let on as though I didn't.
               "Why, what's the matter? You look depressed. I hope nothing unfortunate has
                  happened; you are not hipped, are you?"
               "No," says he, raising his head to suit the word. "Nothing unfortunate ain't
                  happened—ain't hipped nuther, but I'm moughty bad plagued."
               "Why, how now, come, come, untwist!"
               "Now you know as well as I do! You're just letting on you don't."
               
               I assured him to the contrary, and urged him to acquaint me with the cause which
                  had produced so powerful an effect.
               "Well," says he, "I have been fooled, that's the truth; everybody knows it, and if
                  you don't, I had as well tell it to you myself, as any one else, for hear it you
                  will, before you have rode three miles on this trail."
               I kept my face and he went on. "One evening last harvest, I was in a field with my
                  hands—in the prairie field; it was gitting late, and I was pushing to get all my
                  wheat in before night. I had heard occasionally during the afternoon a very
                  strange unfamiliar noise, but hadn't paid much attention to it. The last wheat was
                  on the wagon, and the team was about to move homewards, when the shrillest,
                  keenest noise broke upon us that you ever—it, was just like nothing ever I hearn
                  afore! My boys, one and all, declared it was a painter, and a mad one at that. Now
                  I had never seed a painter, nor never hearn one neither, and as I always hearn
                  tell they made the d—dest noise of all varmints, I just concluded it mought be a
                  stray one and no mistake. Well, we was thar settling what it was, and what we
                  should do, the varmint let loose again several times, one straight after tother!
                  This broke up our cogitation; we hurried to the house! There we found everything
                  in an uproar—dogs barking, and the cattle gathered about bellowing for dear life.
                  It was very alarming, tell you, and I began to feel pretty considerably skeered
                  myself, and I ain't ashamed to own it. What to do I didn't know, but I mustered up
                  my force, and off I started, followed by four niggers, six Injuns, nine cur dogs,
                  that was good as ever treed a varmint, but warnt much for painter, as I soon
                  diskivired; for we beat through the whole of that d—n bottom, without making the
                  least diskivery. The night was sorter darkish and the briars sorter thickish in
                  the bottom, and I reckon I found out what green briars war afore I got home, which
                  was long about late roosting time, and if I didn't d—n that painter some, when I
                  come to find my face and hands striped like Tus-te-nug-gee's legs about
                  'ball-playin' time,' it was just because I couldn't. I went to bed in a bad humor,
                  and as usual, had bad dreams. I thought my grey mare was running a thousand yards
                  agin like A——'s sorrel. The major, and he abeating her just as easy! I felt like I
                  wanted to get away but couldn't budge a peg!
               "Just then some one said, 'Mas Jim, the painter bin in the garden last night, and
                  played old scratch with the fixings.' I didn't start and jump like some people do!
                  I just rolled over and over, out o' bed, and didn't I raise a fuss in the family.
                  When I came to my senses, which was purty soon under circumstances, I found it was
                  broad daylight light, and a grinning nigger standing in the door declaring the
                  painter had bin in the garden the night before, case he'd seen his signs. Well,
                   I reckon it warn't long afore I was out, with niggers, dogs and Injuns,
                  and if we didn't beat up the River to the Verdigris was ransacked, and if a
                  painter had been in thar, I'm keen to swear we'd found it certain. Long about nine
                  o'clock we fetched up at the Ferry, and thar I seed a Georgy dress sitting on a
                  log a "catting."
               "Hellow," says I.
               "Hellow yourself," says he.
               "Have you seen or heard anything of the painter?"
               "Well," says he, "that is nice! Hear anything of that painter! Why I reckon we
                  did; and that's just the biggest painter that ever was whelped."
               "How do you know—did you see it?"
               "Oh, we didn't see it—but reckon as how we hearn it, and it made the
                  all-screamenest kind of noise!"
               "Was you much skeered over here?"
               "Well, wa'nt we? Mammy nearly went into fits they say, when she first hearn it;
                  and I thought I should a——! I was at least a quarter from the house and two fences
                  between! The stock was skeered some too—thar was no getting in the house for 'em,
                  but I 'low thar ain't much danger now, for I guess you've run him off to taller
                  timber."
               
               "I rayther guess it's off, myself, so I'll go home. Here Bringer! Here Bringer!
                  here Turk—here! here! here!! And I turned to ride up the bank, followed by my
                  motley crew, when just then sch-r-r-r-r-r! I looked round wild!—the 'critter' was
                  mizzling about the fastest, with his shirt-tail standing out the straightest? The
                  cry was right out of the swamp, not three hundred yards off! In we bulged, but it
                  warn't no use, we couldn't diskiver any painter high nor low. When we got back to
                  the Ferry I hearn a steamboat coming, so I determined to wait and stand treat. We
                  got down and hitched our critturs; the boat come puffing slowly up—stuck her nose
                  in the bank, made fast, and then that durn'd painter again! Snap went the
                  bridles!—away went our critturs!—wo!—wo!—wo!—wo!—no use! Human ears couldn't stand
                  it, no more brutes. I started some, but I didn't stare as I swore, and I didn't
                  nigh as much as I was wrothy! Yes! by the living thunder, the painter I had been
                  hunting all night, all the morning, the painter I had got my face, hands, and legs
                  barked and scratched for, was nothing more nor less, than some new fangled fixin'
                  of the steamboat 'Guide,' which her durn'd ingineer had been 'musing himself with,
                  to the terrification of the folks, stock, and varmints of the Pint.
               
                  
               
               "I seed how I'd been fooled, and in course felt awfully riled, and when the durn'd
                  noise stopped slack enough to let a teller hear himself think, I just told that
                  Captain that ef he didn't treat my crew, I would take his dugout and turn her
                  wrong-side out. He did what was genteel, and we footed it home for want of
                  nags.
               "Now wasn't I monstrously bad fooled? But that warn't what plagued me most, for
                  just as certain as I met any one arter that I was just as certain to be axed if I
                  had treed that painter yet? And they got in a way of taking me out, just as if
                  they had a secret to tell, and then whisper, 'have you treed that painter yet?'
                  loud enough for all to hear. Durn 'em, I say! I stood it as long as I could, and
                  then took the house, and this is the first time I've been abroad for three
                  weeks."
               In explanation it is only necessary to state that the "Guide" was the first
                  steamer that ever navigated our waters with a fog-whistle attached to her
                  engine.

                        "FLEA.—A small red insect, remarkable for its agility, and
                           which, sucks the blood of larger animals."
                     
                     —JOHNSON.
                  
               
               
                  
                  TRAVELLING, like "misery, makes us acquainted with strange
                  bedfellows." It was on a chance visit to the great metropolis, some few years
                  since, that I "took mine ease" at a snug little tavern. A stranger, I was
                  inquiring of some of the guests in the coffee-room what were the principal sights
                  worth seeing, when I was referred to the landlord as not only the best quarter for
                  intelligence but as "a sight in himself." In a minute or two afterwards mine host
                  made his appearance,—an unwieldy monster of a man, but with a face shining with
                  good humor, and looking singularly amiable and apoplectic. "You want to see
                  something, do you, sir?—then I have the greatest curiosity in natur, I may say in
                  the whole world, and when you have seen it you will say it beats the Living
                     Skeleton. Madam Two-shoes
                  exhibition, and the Infant Liar to smitherins. Should you like to see it?" I of
                  course signified an eager assent, and in a moment afterwards the worthy landlord
                  produced—a pill box!
               We must confess that we would at any time rather see the contents of Pandora's
                  box, as the miniature receptacle for abominations, and probably turned away with
                  some expressions of annoyance. "Wait a moment—don't be in too great a hurry,"—and
                  off went the top of the box, and out hopped with great alacrity—"nothing more,"
                  there could be scarcely anything "less," than a FLEA!—we have
                  certainly seen more disagreeable things come out of a pill-box!—and which seated
                  himself with great composure on the back of the worthy Boniface's hand.
               "Now I'll venture a stiffish bet," said mine host, "that you are wondering what
                  there is more in that flea than any other flea." I must confess mine host had
                  exactly hit the very idea that was then puzzling my brains. "What d'ye think, sir,
                  of his wearing a collar of gold?—look at him through this,"—giving me a magnifying
                  glass, through which I peered at the little monster, and did behold, at that part
                  where his neck should be—if, peradventure, fleas have necks—a shining
                  collar of gold! 
                     "'Twas strange, 'twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous true."
                   For the first time in my unfeeling existence a flea was to me an object of
                  commiseration. What had that flea done, I should like to know, to be
                  selected from the rest of his fellow fleas?—to be cribbed in, coffined up, and
                  incarcerated in a pasteboard dungeon; to view the light of heaven and breathe its
                  air through the holes made by a pin's point on the roof of his prison, when his
                  brother fleas were wandering at their own wild wills in all the blessedness of
                  liberty? Why was he, like Malachi, to drag "his collar of gold," instead of
                  enjoying his 
                     saltatory
                     salutatory
                   exercise of leaping seventy times his own height? Why was he to bear the
                  splendid but galling signs of rank, when he was neither lord mayor nor
                  alderman?—had never gormandized on turtle soup or mulligatawny? An injustice had
                  been committed on that flea—and I felt for that flea as Sterne felt for the
                  starling that cried, "I can't get out."
               It was, however, quite clear, as the poor flea "dragged his slow length along" the
                  rough hand of his master (he was not the first living thing that had been
                  encumbered by a similar burthen!), that he was more an object of triumph than
                  sympathy to his proprietor. "I have had him ever since he was a young un, and I
                  love him as if he was my own babby; six times a day I takes him out of his crib,
                  and gives him his vittells."
               "Victuals?" we exclaimed interrogatively.
               "Yes," said he, pointing to a red puncture in the fleshy part of his thumb, "there
                  he breakfasts, lunches, dines, teas, and sups, and takes his little snacks
                  betweens! Bless him, how he does enjoy it to be sure!" 
                     "Oh love, what is it in this world of ours!"
                   To what wilt thou not make the heart of man cling! The prisoner has watched
                  the meanest flower that forced its head between the stones of his dungeon floor,
                  and in its simple yet wondrous mechanism hath turned from the dark delusions of
                  scepticism and doubt, and owned the conviction of belief.*
                   The solitary captive has made friends with the unclean toad, that visited
                  him in his captivity, and his eyes for the first time felt the blessing of tears,
                  when his gaoler crushed the repulsive—but to him welcome—intruder; and here was
                  this mountain of a man actually cherishing and owning a sympathy for the veriest
                  atom that is inspired with life—a flea; oh wondrous heart of man, that can swell
                  at the grandeur and immensity of creation, and can throb with feeling at the sight
                  of its meanest objects!
               
                  
                  *Vide the beautiful tale of "Picciola"
               
               The man put his flea to bed, "as gently as if he loved it," and I—still thinking
                  of that flea—put myself to bed, to think of men, and perhaps of fleas!
               I laid myself down, first on the right side, and was dropping off into a doze,
                  wondering whether the prisoner in the state pill-box slept in his golden chain, or
                  if he hung it by his side till morning, and slumbered like a common flea in
                  republican simplicity; when lo! I felt as if he had "wandered from his home, and
                  had mistaken the calf of my leg for his proprietor's thumb—a rub and a smart
                  followed—and then I composed myself to sleep again. Hardly had I forgot the rude
                  assault when it was renewed from another quarter—and as fast as I was stung,
                  smarted and rubbed—and rubbed and smarted again—heartily wishing all the fleas
                  ever created were confined in pill-boxes, or feeding on the thumbs of those who
                  liked them!
               Worn out with a day's travelling and three parts asleep—all on a sudden I was
                  roused to consciousness by a painful digging sensation, as if a corkscrew were
                  being driven into the cuticle of my highly irritable table self. With a sudden clutch, I caught the
                  aggressor in flagrante delicto, and seizing him
                  with finger and thumb, I felt THE GOLD CHAIN! One surprise soon, however, gave way
                  to another, for in an instant afterwards I heard "a small, still," but at the same
                  time remarkably shrill and piercing voice exclaim—
               "Halloa, you sir—what the deuce are you about?—that hurts—don't you see that the
                  chain is round my neck, and if you press in that way, you'll throt—throttle me—you
                  calf-head—you clodpole—you Johnny Raw?"
               And I had really lived to be abused by a flea! Letting the vilifier at liberty, I
                  somewhat tartly inquired "what business had he on my shoulder," and muttered
                  something about the lex talionis.
               "What business?—he! he! he! well, that's a good one—I like that!" and here I heard
                  a very audible shrill chuckle—"Why, I was eating my supper what did you think I
                  was about?—he! he! he!"
               "Go and sup off your master's thumb, and leave my carcase alone!" said I, with
                  perhaps more asperity than a flea ought to have provoked under any
                  circumstances.
               "Toujours perdrix, mon ami," (the deuce, thought
                  I—he speaks French!—he must be a flea of education!) "I smelt you out. I always
                  snuff a man fresh from the country, if he is a mile off—it's a way with us, you
                  know—he! he! he!—and you are so good." Here again I felt the
                  diabolical little corkscrew at work!
               "You abominable little reptile, get off, or I will squeeze your very life out—you
                  blood-sucking vampire—you destroyer of good men's rest—you disturber of pleasant
                  dreams!" I really felt indignant with that flea.
               "Now compose yourself; I shall have done directly, for I am obliged to be moderate
                  in my feeds,—a trifle dyspeptic, between ourselves; and how, I should like to
                  know, would you like to be disturbed at your supper? What would you
                  say, when you were swallowing a native, if he were to stick in the middle of your
                  throat, and make you a serious remonstrance? 'Think of that, Master Brook!'"
               "Shakespeare, as I live! Why, you diminutive blood-sucker, sup anywhere you
                  please, but not off my calf!"
               "Why, an't I a right to do as I like with my own? An't fleas the real lords of
                  creation? All the world was made for man,—the birds of the air, the beasts of the
                  field, the fish of the sea,—and man was made for fleas; man may live off any
                  garbage, but human blood alone is the food for fleas, princely fleas!—majestic
                  fleas!"
               All at once my talkative companion seemed to increase in size, and seating himself
                  on his haunches, very complacently began to address me. There was a strange look
                  of intelligence in his sharp features, and more than human animation in his
                  bright, piercing, twinkling eyes!
               
                  
               
               "To a philosophic mind there is something ludicrous in the airs that miserable
                  creature, man, gives himself; he lords it over the creation, and yet is a serf to
                  a thing he despises. A flea looks upon man as man does upon the carcass of a
                  sheep—as something to be eaten—as made merely for his use and enjoyment. But the
                  inferiority of the two races is self-evident: if you claim to be superior, merely
                  because you are the biggest of the two, my poor, short-sighted friend, you are
                  inferior, on your own argument, to the unwieldy elephant, or the lubberly walrus!
                  Look at the melancholy contrast between our mechanism, and muscular lar strength, and your own. I can, when I am
                  disposed for a little exercise, take a leap seventy times my own height—you will
                  run to the theatre, and applaud a man as if he were a god who leaps up one half as
                  high as himself!—and then, too, our mental structure—pooh!" (There was something
                  very contemptuous in the way the flea sneered at our intellectual capabilities;
                  but I let him have his fling out.)
               "And you really mean to set your race before man in mental capacity?"
               "And why not? we both belong to the same family; both are of the blood-sucking
                  order—only sometimes man prefers mutton; but blood—blood—blood—is our cry from the
                  cradle to the grave. But don't take my word for it—judge for yourself."
               I immediately became conscious of the presence of a vast concourse of fleas, that
                  appeared to me of an immense growth, and of a great variety of expression: I could
                  see too a difference in their order and station. The original flea—he of the
                  golden chain—continued to address me.
               "Allow me to introduce to you his most vindictive majesty, our emperor—ours is a
                  mixed constitution, and we don't acknowledge the sovereign to have more than a
                  qualified power; the only real distinction that he possesses is that he is allowed
                  to suck a little more blood than any one of his subjects. D'ye perceive any
                  analogy between the royal prerogatives of men and fleas?—he! he! he!
               "This gentleman is a flea of eminence—the lord high keeper of the great seal, his
                  majesty's conscience—and as such, chief of the lawyer tribe—second only to majesty
                  itself in his power of imbibing.
               "You see there," pointing to some gay-looking fleas in scarlet jackets, we don't
                  want for heroes; they are great blood-suckers in their way, and keep up the glory
                  of this great nation, much in the same way as the glory of your own is kept up, by
                  the quantity of blood that has been lost through them. (Had you there, old boy,
                  and your military greatness, too, I calculate.)
               "Let us go into the common ranks of flea society, and you will find some really
                  respectable professors of blood-sucking.
               "That hungry-looking, pale-faced flea is a bill-discounting attorney. From his
                  looks you would imagine he couldn't draw blood at all. Bless you! you really can't
                  imagine what a gorge the vampire has. Allow me to introduce you." Immediately I
                  felt the lawyer's proboscis penetrate my skin, and every vein in my body appeared
                  to be brought under contribution. "Hold, hold, enough—you can never have too much
                  of a good thing—there, get off!"
               "That rascal there might give even you Christians (although an unbeliever, and
                  eschewer of pork himself) a lesson on brethren living together in unity. His
                  father and one of his brothers are sheriffs' officers, another brother a
                  money-lender, another an auctioneer, and himself an attorney; so you see how
                  beautifully the law of union must work, when they all pull together. The usurer
                  lends some unfortunate wretch cash at forty or sixty per cents, (either's a legal
                  rate among the blood-sucking tribe,) and so having had a tolerable swill out of
                  the victim, hands him over to the attorney, who, by the way, in his double
                  capacity of bill-discounter, occasionally takes the first suck himself—in either
                  case there is very little left in his veins, when he gets free from the attorney's
                  fangs; then the attorney hands him over to the auctioneer, from whom, if there is
                  any thing to be squeezed, sucked, or pumped away, out he comes, very flabby
                  indeed; until at last this band of brothers hand him over, like a well-squeezed
                  orange, to their relative the bailiff, a mere husk, but which, with a little hard
                  pressing, will yield a few drops to reward his exertions. There is one peculiarity
                  about this breed of 'industrious fleas,' they are the only class that prey upon
                  one another. Among us, the opprobrious reproach of 'dog eat dog,' is otherwise
                  never heard; we leave that to the undisturbed enjoyment of those, who 'are but a
                  little lower than the angels,'—men, wolves and sharks."
               My lively friend continued to introduce me in the most graphic and characteristic
                  style to several other members of flea society, and I had the honor of making
                  acquaintance with the relieving officers of their poor-law unions, and heard, that
                  when a flea pauper seeks relief from those admirable institutions, he is set to
                  feed on the carcase of an English pauper, the blood of whom affords the poorest
                  and thinnest nutriment that is capable of keeping a flea's life and soul together;
                  and this principle of their poor-law I was complimented at hearing they had
                  borrowed from our own statute books. I was also introduced to the directors of
                  several of their loan societies, the keepers of their principal gaols, and the
                  owners of their lock-up houses, who, with some eminent pawnbrokers, were, I was
                  assured, amongst the leading members of the blood-sucking fraternity.
               As I found that each of these estimable functionaries made it a point, in some way
                  or the other, to squeeze a drop out of me, either under the pretence of great
                  politeness, or as a specimen of their way of doing business, I found these
                  introductions not only becoming very troublesome, but I was afraid absolute
                  depletion would be the result, and I determined on making my departure, with many
                  thanks for the insight they had afforded me into their admirable institutions.
               
               My valedictory address was received with such a marked feeling of regret that the
                  whole tribe insisted on taking a personal leave of me. Each, as he embraced me,
                  inserted his corkscrew proboscis into my skin, and for each flea went a drop of
                  blood. I could stand this no longer, but with arms and legs resisted most
                  vigorously, until I found myself alone in bed, painfully smarting under the
                  attacks of my vigorous assailants.
               The grey dawn of morning made me at first disposed to treat the whole of the
                  preceding events as the sport of imagination; but the appearance of my outward
                  man, which rivalled the ruddy morn itself convinced me that I had come to a
                     rash conclusion; that it was no dream, and that I had actually
                  enjoyed "A Night wi' the Industrious Fleas."
            
            
               
                  
               
               THE HUSBAND'S FRIEND.
               I WISH, ladies and gentlemen, that you knew my Uncle Savory—he is such an
                  excellent fellow—such an adept at composing (for it is nothing less) a salad,
                  brewing a jorum of punch, or filling the chair at a club dinner. His eye is as
                  bright as the Bude light, while his face looks like a map af good humor, every
                  wrinkle being the boundary of some merriment. He promises to be as fat as a butter
                  firkin, though my grandmother has a picture of him when he was as slim as a
                  three-score and ten spinster. He was in love at that time, and this very likeness
                  was intended as a gift to his dulcinea. Luckily,
                  uncle found her out before he had so far committed himself as to present her with
                  his effigie. She jilted him most shamefully, and
                  Uncle Savory took his disappointment so seriously to heart, that he became
                  misanthropical, and retired from the world with no other companion than a bottle
                  of Irish whiskey and a German tobacco-pipe. He remained in a state of seclusion
                  for eight and forty hours, and was for years as broken-hearted a man as love ever
                  subjugated. He resolved to avoid the chances of a second attachment; so gave up
                  housekeeping, took furnished apartments, dined promiscuously, drank moderately,
                  retired to rest whenever it suited his humor, and exercised the enviable privilege
                  of letting himself in by a latch-key.
               There is a little club called the "Ringdoves." It derives its name from the
                  members being all married men, with one exception, and that one was my Uncle
                  Savory. The Ringdoves hold their meetings in one of the out of the way corners of
                  the metropolis, and are famous for nothing but their tendency to good-fellowship
                  and decided aversion to early hours.
               Uncle Savory was very popular with this set of roysterers; he was not given to
                  jeer at matrimony, sang a very tolerable song, and never rose from the table until
                  every one else had departed. In fact, he might be considered as the thong which
                  bound together those convivial fasces; and
                  whenever the gout bound him at home by the toe, the "Ringdoves seemed another set
                  of beings," or, as one of them remarked, "They all seemed at home,"
                  which, according to their illustration of that popular phrase, signified that they
                  were insufferably dull.
               The consequence of this popularity of my Uncle Savory was a world of
                  misrepresentation; and a few weeks since, the malignity to which he was exposed
                  brought him into such a state of despondency that he was actually detected
                  drinking a tumbler of unadulterated filtered water—mark the
                  peculiarity of this disorder—the water was actually filtered!
               
               As I shall not be able to frame an apology for my uncle thus degrading himself, I
                  will merely detail the persecution which induced this pitiable physical and moral
                  prostration.
               Women (Goddesses that they are!) have a logic peculiarly their own. With them it
                  is an axiom, "that their own husbands can do no wrong but at the instigation of
                  others."
               
               I have said that the "Ringdoves" were married men, and consequently received from
                  their respective spouses the benefit of the aforenamed immunity—alloyed, however,
                  by the infliction of those "pains and penalties" which wedded ladies know how to
                  administer so admirably.
               Reader, you must fancy the return home of Mr. Brown, of the Ringdoves, and a
                  colloquy something like the following:—
               "Oh, it is you—nice time to come home, Brown—past one—and the fire
                  out."
               "My dear, I'm ashamed—"
               "Oh, nonsense."
               "I am, indeed. Is that the boot-jack?—but I couldn't get away; and—ugh!—curse the
                  boot!"
               "Not get away? you talk like a child. There, don't drink cold water in that
                  manner—you had better take a couple of Cockles! There's two
                  striking."
               "Two! Really, my dear, I'd no idea of the time. Is my night-cap on your side?"
               "Here!"
               "Well, you needn't throw it into the ewer. You're angry."
               "Angry—isn't it past two?"
               "It wasn't my fault. There was Jackson, and little What's-his-name that keeps a
                  pony, and Savory."
               "Savory!—that man ought to be ashamed of himself; he never goes home. I should
                  like to tell him a little of my mind."
               "He's my fri—end,—my dear, and puts—less—oil in his—punch—"
               "He's a perfect nuisance, and oughtn't to associate with married men.
                  Brown!—Brown! Why you're snoring!"
               During the above, Mrs. Jackson may be also indulging in a soliloquy, and a fancy
                  portrait of her husband's friend—Uncle Savory.
               "These coals ar'n't worth a farthing—Brown ought to be prosecuted for selling such
                  rubbish—Jackson's a fool to deal with him. Two o'clock! Jackson's with that Savory
                  again. What a brute that fellow must be—how Jackson can degrade himself by making
                  a friend of such a low—red haired—I hate red hair—red faced—tipsy—I wonder if he's
                  ever sober-abandoned roué. Jackson never used to
                  go on in this way till he knew Savory—quarter past two—that Savory's a villain. I
                  wonder what he has been—a gambler—a smuggler—(that's Jackson's step! No, it
                  isn't)—a pirate—a spy—(there's a cab. No, it has stopp'd next door)—a forger—a
                  returned convict. Gracious me! can any thing have happened to Jackson? Has that
                  Savory been playing tricks with him? Has——. Oh! there he is. I'll lock up the
                  liquor bottle, let him in, and tell him what I think of his friend Savory."
               These scenes are not altogether imaginary; the phraseology alone partakes of the
                  ideal, but every lady of every member of the "Ringdoves," looked upon Uncle Savory
                  as their husband's friend, and abused and misrepresented him accordingly. Poor
                  uncle! little did he think that while he listened to the eulogy of first one and
                  then the other of the "Ringdoves," and felt the blood in his heart bubbling with
                  honest pride at their commendations of his salads and punch, his songs and
                  admirable conduct in the chair, that their fairer and better moieties were
                  loading, him with "curses not loud but deep," as the primary cause of the
                  consumption of rushlights and connubial absenteeism.
               The veil was at length removed from his eyes towards the heel of as pleasant an
                  evening as ever gathered upon the orgies of the happy fraternity of the Ringdoves.
                  Jackson twitted Brown with being a nightly auditor to a private lecture on the
                  "conjugal duties;" Brown retaliated upon Briggs, whose laugh was the loudest at
                  the marital penance of his fellow "Ringdove." Briggs revenged himself upon Dobbs,
                  who had been betrayed into an expression of sympathy for his nocturnal snubbings;
                  Dobbs fillipped Smith; Smith grilled Jones; Jones roused White; and so on, until
                  each member of the club had confessed to keeping "a grey mare," and laughed
                  heartily at his own domestic thraldom. Uncle Savory was paralysed; for every man
                  had ended his acknowledgement with the same harrowing assertion—
               'My wife says it's all Savory's fault!"
               He had fancied himself indifferent to the opinion of the world in general, and of
                  the fairer portion in particular; but now that he heard himself a by-word by men's
                  hearths—a social vampyre that was feeding upon the domestic felicity of a dozen
                  hearts, he felt the punch become ice in his bowels and the fragrant fumes of his
                  beloved weed change to the unsavoriness of an expiring handle.
               
               The last "Ringdove" had departed, and still my uncle sat with an empty jug before
                  him; and it was not until the waiter, surprised at the phenomenon of his
                  abstinence, informed him that it was three o'clock, that he laid down his long
                  exhausted pipe, and retired to his lonely chamber.
               How desolate appeared his condition! He would have given half that he was worth
                  for one of those curtain lectures of which he had heard so much during the past
                  evening; but there was nothing sitting up for him but a little night lamp that
                  burned as steadily as though it were upon the altar of a Romish saint. If it had
                  only sputtered, my Uncle Savory would have been gratified. No, he was alone! No
                  angered voice, yet gentle in its anger, reproached him for the lateness of his
                  return, or excused his regretted absence by the attractions of some husband's
                  friend. He felt the whole weight of the convivial delinquencies of the club rested
                  upon his devoted name, and he shuddered at the conviction. Uncle Savory doats upon
                  children. In the humor he was in, the strangest fancy found ready admittance into
                  his brain, and he imagined that all the infant Ringdoves, in their prayers for
                  protection, were taught to lisp his name in conjunction with that of the wicked
                  one. He thought he heard the angered mother threaten her perverse child to "send
                  for Mr. Savory," and then he recalled the visions of his early love, and began to
                  speculate upon the possibility of his heart sprouting again.
               The latter idea acted as a sedative, and he became sufficiently calm to mix a
                  small glass of brandy and water, and resort to his old friend, the meerschaum.
               The twittering of the house sparrows at length warned him of the day-break, and he
                  crept into bed with a very confused head, the result either of drinking or
                  reflection—my own opinion leans to the former supposition.
               For some evenings the Ringdoves saw nothing of my Uncle Savory, and the only
                  information they could gain of him was from a small piece of paper which they
                  found wafered on his door, inscribed with this laconic sentence—"Gone out;"—but
                  where?—that was the mystery; and serious thoughts were entertained of advertising
                  the missing gentleman, when, to the great relief of the little community, Uncle
                  Savory made his appearance at the Thursday's meeting.
               Many were the inquiries as to the cause of his absence, but upon this point he
                  refused to satisfy them; and as his wonted humor diffused its influence amongst
                  them, they soon ceased to care for the past in the enjoyment of the present. The
                  fact is, my uncle had stolen quietly down to Coney Island, in order to argue over
                  in his own mind what he ought to do in his present state of feeling. At first, he
                  inclined to matrimony; but recollecting what a violent change it would necessarily
                  produce, he gave up the pleasing dream, and set to work to free himself from the
                  odium attached to a husband's friend. The plan he decided upon was a simple one,
                  and accident enabled him to execute it at much less trouble and inconvenience than
                  he at first anticipated.
               It so happened that Mrs. Brown had issued invitations for a tea-party, on the
                  evening succeeding my uncle's return, and he learned with extreme delight that the
                  visitors included all the wives of the "Ringdoves." A little badinage, cleverly introduced by Uncle Savory, induced
                  every husband to promise to attend at the club and abandon the tea-table—a
                  resolution which was strengthened by the assurance of my uncle that he should
                  consider their presence on the ensuing evening as a personal obligation to
                  himself.
               The morrow evening came, but not Uncle Savory, and numerous were the conjectures
                  of the "Ringdoves" to account for his absence. As I have no wish to keep the
                  reader in suspense, let me beg of him to conceive the drawing-room of Mrs. Brown,
                  crowded with the wives of the "Ringdoves," and at that point of time when the
                  marital misdemeanors were the universal subject of conversation.
               "Of course you have heard of Savory?" inquired Mrs. Brown.
               "What! that fellow!" exclaimed Mrs. Dobbs.
               "A little imp!" said Mrs. Jackson.
               "The greatest nuisance that I know," remarked Mrs.
                  Briggs.
               "That—what shall I call him," continued Mrs. Brown, pausing for a word
                  sufficiently comprehensive to express the fulness of her
                     disgust—"That—that—friend of my husband—"
               "And mine!" said Mrs. Briggs.
               "And mine!" said Mrs. Dodds.
               "And mine!" said Mrs. Jackson—"that friend is the tempter—the
                  Mephistophiles that leads my poor J. into late hours and incipient
                  intoxication."
               Briggs, Dobbs, Jackson, &c., were declared to be equally victims.
               "I do believe if I were to see that wretch," said Mrs. Brown, "that I should—"
                  here she paused to peruse the inscription on a card which the servant had just
                  delivered to her—her lip whitened—the bird of Paradise in her turban shook as with
                  an ague as she gasped out the name of 
                     MR. ROGER SAVORY.
                   Had a bomb-shell been suddenly dropped into the tea-urn, the party could not have been more
                  panic-stricken—a feeling that was not allayed by the entrance of my uncle—the
                  universal bugbear; the "Spring-heeled Jack"—to their domestic quiet!
               My uncle paused at the door—he bowed—(he is celebrated for his bow). Mrs. Brown
                  rose and hinted—mind, only hinted—a curtsy.
               "I am afraid that I am an intruder," said my uncle in the blandest of tones;
                  "but"—and he paused.
               "O dear, no!" replied Mrs. Brown, "pray"—(her conscience smote her as she uttered
                  the request)—"pray be seated."
               "Thank you," said my uncle, depositing his goodly person in a chair. "I expected
                  to have found Mr. Brown here."
               "Here!" answered the lady, "surely, Mr. Savory, you could not have expected Mr.
                  Brown had returned home—at—this—early—hour."
               Mrs. Jackson had been bursting to speak. "Perhaps, my dear, Mr. Savory knows his
                  own attractions; and considered it probable, that as he was away, Mr. B. might
                  have thought of his wife and friends."
               It did not coincide with my uncle's purpose to understand the drift of Mrs.
                  Jackson's remarks—he therefore smiled.
               "My object in calling," he said at length, "was to leave my address in
                  Philadelphia."
               "In Philadelphia!" exclaimed the ladies simultaneously.
               "In Philadelphia," continued my uncle. "I leave town in three hours; and I fear it
                  will be—years"—(here my uncle blew his nose griefully)—"ere I return to my native
                  land."
               A beam of pleasure stole over every countenance in the room.
               "Pray, take a cup of tea," said Mrs. Brown, "as you are going to travel it may,
                  perhaps, be agreeable."
               "You are very kind," answered my uncle—and drawing his chair to the table, he
                  accepted the proffered beverage.
               By degrees he contrived to lead the ladies into conversation; and by touching upon
                  those topics only which he conceived to be most acceptable to them, contrived to
                  prolong his visit until within half an hour of the time he had named for his
                  departure. He rose, and gracefully took his leave, requesting that his best wishes
                  might be conveyed to the absent husbands. The ladies declared that Mr. Savory was
                  anything but a disagreeable man.
               No sooner had the street door closed upon my uncle than he threw himself into a
                  cab, and ordered the driver to convey him to the locality of the "Ringdoves." He
                  rushed into the room, as though breathless from exertion, and tendered a thousand
                  apologies for his unavoidable absence ordered in a bowl of punch as a peace
                  offering, and commenced a fusillade of jokes that soon set the "table in a roar."
                  The clock chimed three as the merry roysterers turned into the street, each voting
                  Uncle Savory "the best fellow in the world."
               The result was exactly what my uncle anticipated. Not one wife would admit the old
                  excuse—"It was that Savory!"
               "Savory, the agreeable gentleman who was then snoring in the cars?
                  Impossible!"
               
                  
               
               From that night all the ladies were convinced that my uncle was an injured
                  innocent, and the Ringdoves, fearful of exciting more illiberal suspicions, never
                  sought to palliate their delinquencies by the mention of the name of their "friend
                  Savory."
            
            
               
               THE IRISH PRIEST'S FROLIC.
               
                  
                  WELL, why, long ago in the barony of Imokilly, in the county of
                  Cork, by the roadside at the foot of Wather-grass hill, there lived an owld
                  schamer ov a man, in a bit ov a farm, wid a turf bog a' one side, an' a garden ov
                  pratees convanient. All the childther he had in the worl' was one girl, a
                  daughther—an' 'tis she was the fine, clevir colleen, tidy an' purty as you'd wish
                  to be afther lookin' at, an' a good knitter, an' spinner, an' every thing that 'ed
                  be wantin' to her to be, why she was. Well, one day as the owld cobbeen, her
                  father, was standin' at the treshould ov the doore, what 'ed he see but a ha'f
                  careless soort ov a fellow comin' up to him wid his grate-coat hangin' to his
                  shoulthers, an' his brogues clippin' to his heels!
               "God save ye!" says the strange boy; "God save ye kindly!" says the owld man,
                  inside the doore. "I'm this way lookin' for a place," says the begaun beg;*
                   "would ye be afther hirein' a servant?" says he. "Och! no!" says the owl
                  fello' shakin' his head, "I've no call for a servant;" and thin, as if the second
                  thought cum to him, "What wages are you askin'?" says he. "Faith! whatevir 'ed be
                  plazing to yourself," says the poor boy, no ways partick'lar, by reason he was so
                  bad off. "What work are ye able for?" says the other. "Wisha! I can dig and reap
                  an' 'tach," says the boy, "an' be handy for other things about the house, if it
                  'ed be wantin' for me." "See that now—'pon my word! I'll engage 'tis you're the
                  clevir boy enough," says the owld schamer, puttin' out a bandle†
                   ov his tongue behind his back; "but I don't want a boy at all, at all,"
                  says he, "only as I likes the look ov ye, I'll tell ye what I'll be afther doing
                  wid ye,"—wid that the boy looks up at him like a young crow wid his mouth
                  open—"I've a nice little' piece ov a girl widin' here," says the big owld rogue,
                  "only she's too young to marry yet, the crathur; but if you'll wait a mather ov
                  three years, I'll give her to ye, an' faith I can tell ye she'll hav' no bad
                  potion comnin' to her."
               
                  *Simple boy.
               
               
                  †A measure so called.
               
               Well, why the boy was a poor, soft, gomatah of a fello', an' he reddened up to the
                  two ears, for what 'ed he see peeping out at him but the colleen herself, an' she
                  ready to die wid the laugh she had—an' sure enough such another purty crathur ever
                  he seen; an' "Gor! I will," says he. "Very well," says the owld father, puttin' a
                  grin on himself, to think how fine an' aisy he got him (for sure he had no
                  intention of the soort, only jist to make a fool ov him, as he seem'd sich a
                  shrimallah mathaum*
                  altogether).
               
                     *Foolish fellow.
                  
               Well an' good, he was the best poor fello' evir cum into a house; everything
                  thriv'd with him better than another; an' before the ind ov the three years he had
                  as fine a farm for the owld schamp as you'd see from this to Droghedy (ov the
                  likes ov it); an' 'tis he had the doing an' doctherin' of every thing, buying an'
                  sellin'; I'll engage 'tis himself used to do it all; an' whin he'd be goin' to a
                  fair, or a pathern, faith he'd hav' his saddle craikin' undther him, like a rale
                  gintleman; an' a crown or more may be to spind by an' by, for all the worl' as if
                  he war the owld man's son; an' faith if it is the girl an' himself got very fond
                  entirely ov one another; an' between the business an' the coortin' he didn't
                     hear the three years goin' from him. At long last he says this way
                  to the owld father "The three years are gone now," says he, "an 'tis time for me
                  to think ov myself a mossa! You can't say any way but I did my juty by ye. So now,
                  in God's name, giv' me the little girl as you promised me in the big'ning, an' let

                  daughter to the likes ov you, for a know nothing caubogue?" says the owld
                  monsthrous deceiver, screechin' out, an' puttin' a crane's neck on himself. "Do
                  you think it is mad I am, or what ails me? Don't mintion it," says he, "ye Kerry
                  goat! ye camel! ye gipsy!" says he, "the ha'f-starved gossoon that I tuck in
                  afther skimble skambling about the counthry like a wild Ingin!" says he; an' wid
                  that he fell a coughing, as if the life 'ed leave him wid the bare madness. "O!
                  there's no harm done, at all evints," says the poor boy, for all he was scalded to
                  the heart. "The world's wide," says he; "so pay me my wages in the way; I 'ont be any longer a Kerry goat wid ye, an'
                  let me go about my business." "As for wages," says the owld man, settin' a grin on
                  himself, "I never promised ye the like; an' since you hav' been wid me," says he,
                  "did I ever hindther you ov doing what 'ed be plazing to yourself? an' often gav'
                  ye a tinpenny, an' a crown, an' lint ye my own horse an' saddle, not to mintion
                  the cortheroy shute, an' the illegant blue coat for Sunday; it would be fitther
                  for ye," says he, "to go to yer business, an' nat mind the likes. I can't say but
                  what you're a quiet honest boy, anyhow; but my daughter's young enough to marry
                  yet a while; wait another little spell an' she's for ye."
               Well, the boy goes in with himself; but if it is he entermined in his own mind to
                  match the owld rogue. So in a short time he says to him, says he, "Since first I
                  cum to you I never sot eyes on my own people; so wid ye'r lave," says he, "I've a
                  great notion ov going for a  couple ov days to see a relation of my
                  mother's (may the heavens be her bed!) that's not a grate way off from us." "Do,
                  avick! in God's name," says the owld man, "an' take the horse wid ye an' my
                  blessin', but don't stay long." "There's no fear ov that," says the boy, with a
                  shy look at Kate.
               We'll away wid him, 'til he came to a priest's house, that was a soort ov a
                  relation to himself, an' faith the priest was rejiced to see him for this reason,
                  because he came so sildom, an' he axed him where he was, an' how the worl' used
                  him; and wid that the boy up an' tould every thing that had happen'd to him, first
                  an' last, an' how the owld schamer of a man had decaived him, wid his plaumaussa
                  an' soft talk in regard ov his daughther—not forgetting the friendship that was
                  betwixt them.
               "Keep up yor spirits," says the priest, "an' don't giv' yerself any uneasiness
                  about it," says he; "lave the mather to me, and never fear but I'll find a way to
                  punish the owld rogue: tell me is he a good warrant to give a beggar a night's
                  lodging?" "O, thin, indeed, he is," says Shone, "Devil a bether, wid respect to
                  you." "Well an' good," says the priest, "we'll manage the business betwixt us;"
                  an' wid that, my dear, he tells the boy the plan he had; an' whin it was all
                  fixed, away wid Shone, as fast as the horse's four legs ed take him home agin. So
                  the first opporthunity he got, he tould Kate ov the scheme betwixt himself an' the
                  priest, an' long enough they thought it, till a couple ov nights aftherwards, whin
                  at the God's speed, jis as they war sittin' down to their supper, who'd cum up to
                  the doore but a fine slashing fello' ov a begger? "God save all here," says he;
                  "God save ye kindly," says the owld man, making answer. "Charity, for the honor ov
                  God! an' the Lord spare the provither," says the strange begger, outside the
                  doore. "Come in, in God's name," says the owld man, making' room for him beside
                  the hob. "Hav' ye a good warrant to tell a story?" says he. "Oh! thin, 'tis I that
                  hav'," says the beggerman.
               So win the pratees were boiled, he got his supper along wid the rest, an' a dthrop
                  ov potheen afther it. An' whin the neighbors heard ov the strange begger being
                  there, they all gathered to 'em, and sot down about the fire, listening to the
                  stories, an' if they hadn't quoile*
                   the dicens bein' in the dice. Wid that the owld man's heart was open; an'
                  by an' by the beggerman whispers him, "That's the purty piece ov a colleen,"
                  pointing to the daughther. "Oh! thin, indeed, she is," says the father, pullin' up
                  his cravat, "an' as good as she's purty. "An' is that fine grown gossoon ye'r
                  son?" says the purty boy ov a begger. "Och, no," says the owld man, puttin' a
                  twist in his nose, "och, no. Is it that
                  shrimallah mathaun to be my sun? Wait awhile, why, till I'll tell ye about him.
                  That fello' hav' been wid me these three years, workin' for nothin' only his
                  'ating an' dthrinking, an' a thrifle of cloathes, on account ov a soort ov half
                  promise I gave him ov my daughter." "Oh! the insensible boy, I'm astonished at
                  him," says the begger. "Wisha! I can't blame ye," says the owld cobbeen. "Sich a
                  fool entirely I never heard ov," says the other. "I'll engage you didn't," says
                  the owld man; "but I can tell ye, that to this day he hav' every notion of it;
                  nothing else is keepin' him here."
               
                  
                  *Fun.
               
               Wid that the two ov thim burst out laughing, an' the beggerman says to the owld
                  fello', "Faith 'tis a pity not to make a fool ov him all-together, since he's so
                  soft." "Iss, if we had any soort ov a plan," says the father. "Whist, wait awhile"
                  says the good begger; "Dicens a castle in Kildare, if I don't find a schame
                  that'll be afther makin' a rale show ov him. I do' know," says he, looking a
                  little unsaritin, "if it 'ed be of any use for me. I'm afeard afther all he's not
                  sich a' gamallah as to b'lieve me." "Yea, what is it, agra?" says the other
                  (impatient he was 'till he'd hear the schame). "I was thinkin', if I'de let on as
                  I was a priest that had a vow," says the begger,winkn' his eye at the owld man.
                  "Oh! that's illegant, says the owld granther, screeching out, laughing. "Come
                  here, Shone avick!" says he "'tis many a long day since I promised Kate to ye, a
                  nenow! an' now she's for you—take her, in God's name, an' my blessin', an' the
                  blessin' ov God may 'tind ye—ye! What are you doing lookin' about ye, this way an'
                  that way, as if the sinses had left ye? This is no begger at all, at all," says
                  he, whispering him, "but a priest that comes all the way from your own place, so
                  call over the little girl till you'll get married. Devil a doubt but we'll hav'
                  one merry night out ov ye, at all evints." Wid that all the people began to laugh,
                  an' Shone put a soft face on himself, in the way he'd keep up the joke. "'Tis
                  funnin' you are!" says he, "'for how 'ed we be married widout a ring?" "Oh! that's
                  thrue, sure enough," says the owld fellow. "Kate, aragal!" says he, winkin' at
                  her, as if it were to carry on the fun, "Kate, aragal! there's your mother's ring
                  (God rest her sowl!) in the big chest beyond there."*
               
                  
                  *The lower order of Irish are not superstitious as regards a twice-used
                     ring."
               
               So, faith, it wasn't long till she brought it up, an' the pair ov thin went down
                  upon their knees before the priest (as it were). "I know every bit of the
                  podreen," says the begger, whispering over to the owld man, that was crackin' his
                  sides wid the laugh he had; an' sure enough he said every word of it just as if it
                  is the book he was reading, till he cum to put the ring on her finger whin down he
                  lets the ragged owld coat fall off ov him, an' there he was, a rale priest, sure
                  enough. "Och! murther!" says the owld man, screeching out, "ye pack of outrageous
                  schamers—ye vagabonds ov the world!" says he; "sure I  didn't mean it at
                  all, only for a bit ov divarshion." "Hould y'er nise, my good man," says the 
                     preist
                     priest
                  , "'tis jist as good for you, for this young couple is as lawfully
                  married as any in the room, an' with y'er own consint too; God bless ye, young
                  people," says he, "an' spare ye long together." An' wid that the people couldn't
                  keep the laugh off ov them, for all the priest was to the fore, to think how fine
                  the old sleveen was caught in his own thrap.
            
            
               
               NOVELTY AND ROMANCEMENT.
               A BROKEN SPELL.
               
                  
                  I HADgrave doubts at first whether to call this passage of my life
                  "A Wail," or "A Pœan," so much does it contain that is great and glorious, so much
                  that is sombre and stern. Seeking for something which should be a sort of medium
                  between the two, I decided at last, on the above heading—wrongly, of course; I am
                  always wrong: but let me be calm. It is a characteristic of the true orator never
                  to yield to a burst of passion at the outset; the mildest of commonplaces are all
                  he can indulge in at first, and thence he mounts gradually;—"vires acquirit eundo." (See cover.) Suffice it, then,
                  to say, in the first place, that I am Leopold Edgar Stubbs. I state
                  this fact distinctly in commencing, to prevent all chance of the reader's
                  confounding me either with the eminent shoemaker of that name, of Pottle-street,
                  Camberwell, or with my less reputable, but more widely known, namesake, Stubbs,
                  the light comedian of the Provinces; both which connexions I repel with horror and
                  disdain: no offence, however, being intended to either of the individuals
                  named—men whom I have never seen whom I hope I never shall.
               So much for commonplaces.
               Tell me now, oh! man, wise in interpretation of dreams and omens, how it chanced
                  that, on a Friday afternoon, turning suddenly out of Great Wattles-street, I
                  should come, into sudden and disagreeable collision with an humble individual of
                  unprepossessing exterior, but with an eye that glowed with all the fire of genius?
                  I had dreamed at night that the great idea of my life was to be fulfilled. What
                  was the great idea of my life? I will tell you. With shame and sorrow I will tell
                  you.
               My thirst and passion from boyhood (predominating over the love of taws and
                  running neck and neck with my appetite for toffy) has been for poetry—for poetry
                  in its widest and wildest sense—for poetry untrammelled by the laws of sense,
                  rhyme, or rhythm, soaring through the universe, and echoing the music of the
                  spheres! From my youth, nay, from my very cradle, I have yearned for poetry, for
                  beauty, for novelty, for romancement. When I say "yearned," I employ a word mildly
                  expressive of what may be considered as an outline of my feelings in my calmer
                  moments: it is about as capable of picturing the headlong impetuosity of my
                  life-long-enthusiasm as those unanatomical paintings which adorn the outside of
                  the Adelphi, representing Flexmore in one of the many conceivable attitudes into
                  which the human frame has never yet been reduced, are of conveying to the
                  speculative pit-goer a true idea of the feats performed by that extraordinary
                  compound of humanity and Indian-rubber.
               I have wandered from the point: that is a peculiarity, if I may be permitted to
                  say so, incidental to life; and, as I remarked on an occasion which time will not
                  suffer me more fully to specify, "What, after all, is life?" nor did
                  I find any one of the individuals present (we were a party of nine, including the
                  waiter, and it was while the soup was being removed that the above-recorded
                  observation was made) capable of furnishing me with a rational answer to the
                  question.
               The verses which I wrote at an early period of life were eminently distinguished
                  by a perfect freedom from conventionalism, and were thus unsuited to the present
                  exactions of literature: in a future age they will be read and admired, "when
                  Milton," as my venerable uncle has frequently exclaimed, "when Milton and such
                  like is forgot!" Had it not been for this sympathetic relative, I firmly believe
                  that the poetry of my nature would never have come out; I can still recall the
                  feelings which thrilled me when he offered me sixpence for a rhyme to "despotism."
                  I never succeeded, it is true, in finding the rhyme, but it was on the very next
                  Wednesday that I penned my well known "Sonnet on a Dead Kitten," and in the course
                  of a fortnight had commenced three epics, the titles of which I have unfortunately
                  now forgotten.
               Seven volumes of poetry have I given to an ungrateful world during my life; they
                  have all shared the fate of true genius—obscurity and contempt. Not that any fault
                  could be found with their contents; whatever their deficiencies may have been,
                     no reviewer has yet dared to criticise them. This is a great
                  fact.
               The only composition of mine which has yet made any noise in the world, was a
                  sonnet I addressed to one of the Corporation of Muggleton-cum-Swillside, on the
                  occasion of his being selected Mayor of that town. It was largely circulated
                  through private hands, and much talked
                  of at the time; and though the subject of it, with characteristic vulgarity of
                  mind, failed to appreciate the delicate compliments it involved and indeed spoke
                  of it rather disrespectfully than otherwise, I am inclined to think that it
                  possesses all the elements of greatness. The concluding couplet was added at the
                  suggestion of a friend, who assured me it was necessary to complete the sense, and
                  in this point.] deferred to his mature judgement:— 
                     
                        "When Desolation snatched her tearful prey
                        From the lorn empire of despairing day;
                        When all the light, by gemless fancy thrown,
                        Served but to animate the putrid stone;
                        When monarchs, lessening on the wildered sight,
                        Crumblingly vanished into utter night;
                        When murder stalked with thirstier strides abroad
                        And redly flashed the never-sated sword;
                        In such an hour thy greatness had been seen—
                        That is, if such an hour had ever been—
                        In such an hour thy praises shall be sung,
                        If not by mine, by many a worthier tongue;
                        And thou be gazed upon by wondering men,
                        When such an hour arrives, but not till then!"
                     
                  
               
               Alfred Tennyson is Poet Laureate, and it is not for me to dispute his claim to
                  that eminent position; still I cannot help thinking, that if the Government had
                  only come forward candidly at the time, and thrown the thing open to general
                  competition, proposing some subject to test the powers of the candidate (say
                  "Frampton's Pill of Health, an Acrostic"), a very different result might have been
                  arrived at.
               But let us return to our muttons (as our noble allies do most unromantically
                  express themselves), and to the mechanic of Great Wattlesstreet. He was coming out
                  of a small shop—rudely built it was, dilapidated exceedingly, and in its general
                  appearance seedy—what did I see in all this to inspire a belief that a great epoch
                  in my existence had arrived? Reader, I saw the signboard!
               Yes. Upon that rusty signboard, creaking awkwardly on its one hinge against the
                  mouldering wall, was an inscription which thrilled me from head to foot with
                  unwonted excitement. "Simon Lubkin. Dealer in Romancement." Those were the very
                  words.
               It was Friday the fourth of June, half-past four, p.m.
               Three times I read that inscription through, and then took out my pocketbook; and
                  copied it on the spot, the mechanic regarding me during the whole proceeding with
                  a stare of serious and (as I thought at the time) respectful astonishment.
               I stopped that mechanic, and entered into conversation with him: years of agony
                  since then have gradually branded that scene upon my writhing heart, and I can
                  repeat all that passed, word for word.
               Did the mechanic (this was my first question) possess a kindred soul, or did he
                  not?
               Mechanic didn't know as he did.
               Was he aware (this with thrilling emphasis) of the meaning of that glorious
                  inscription upon his signboard?
               Bless you, mechanic knew all about that 'ere.
               Would mechanic (overlooking the suddenness of the invitation) object to adjourn to
                  the neighboring public-house, and there discuss the point more at leisure?
               Mechanic would not object to a drain. On the contrary.
               (Adjournment accordingly: brandy-and-water for two: conversation resumed.)
               
                  
               
               Did the article sell well, especially with the "mobile
                     vulgus?"
               Mechanic cast a look of good-natured pity on the questioner: the article sold
                  well, he said, and the vulgars bought it most.
               
               Why not add "Novelty" to the inscription? (This was a critical moment: I trembled
                  as I asked the question.)
               Not so bad an idea, mechanic thought: time was, it might have answered; but time
                  flies, you see.
               Was mechanic alone in his glory, or was there any one else who dealt as largely in
                  the article?
               Mechanic would pound it there was none.
               What was the article employed for? (I brought this question out with a gasp,
                  excitement almost choking my utterance.)
               It would piece a'most anything together, mechanic believed, and make it solider
                  nor stone.
               This was a sentence difficult of interpretation. I thought it over a little, and
                  then said, doubtfully, "you mean, I presume, that it serves to connect the broken
                  threads of human destiny? to invest with a—with a sort of vital reality the
                  chimerical products of a fertile imagination?"
               Mechanic's answer was short, and anything but encouraging: "mought be——. I's no
                  scollard, bless you."
               At this point conversation certainly began to flag; I was seriously debating in my
                  own mind whether this could really be the fulfilment of my life-cherished dream;
                  so ill did the scene harmonize with my ideas of romance, and so painfully did I
                  feel my companion's lack of sympathy in the enthusiasm of my nature—an enthusiasm
                  which has found vent, ere now, in actions which the thoughtless crowd have too
                  often attributed to mere eccentricity.
               I have risen with the lark—"day's sweet harbinger"—(once, certainly, if not
                  oftener), with the aid of a patent alarum, and have gone forth at that unseemly
                  hour, much to the astonishment of the housemaid cleaning the door steps, to "brush
                  with hasty steps the dewy lawn," and have witnessed the golden dawn with eyes yet
                  half-closed in sleep (I have always stated to my friends, in any allusion to the
                  subject, that my raptures at that moment were such that I have never since
                  ventured to expose myself to the influence of excitement so dangerous. In
                  confidence, however, I admit that the reality did not come up to the idea I had
                  formed of it over night, and by no means repaid the struggle of getting out of bed
                  so early.)
               I have wandered in the solemn woods at night, and bent me o'er the moss-grown
                  fountain, to lave in its crystal stream my tangled locks and fevered brow. (What
                  though I was laid up with a severe cold in consequence, and that my hair was out
                  of curl for a week? Do paltry considerations such as these, I ask, affect the
                  poetry of the incident?)
               I have thrown open my small, but neatly furnished, cottage tenement, in the
                  neighborhood of St. John's Wood, and invited an aged beggar in to "sit by my fire,
                  and talk the night away." (It was immediately after reading Goldsmith's "Deserted
                  Village." True it is that he told me nothing interesting, and that he took the
                  hall-clock with him when he departed in the morning; still my uncle has always
                  said that he wishes he had been there, and that it displayed in me a freshness and
                  greenness of fancy (or "disposition," I forget which) such as he had never
                  expected to see.)
               I feel that it is incumbent on me to enter more fully into this latter topic—the
                  personal history of my uncle: the world will one day learn to revere the talents
                  of that wonderful man, though a want of funds prevents, at present, the
                  publication of the great system of philosophy.
               Such a man was my uncle; and with such a man did I resolve to confront the
                  suspected mechanic. I appointed the following morning for an interview, when I
                  would personally inspect "the article" (I  could not bring myself to
                  utter the beloved word itself). I passed a restless and feverish night, crushed by
                  a sense of the approaching crisis.
               
               The hour came at last—the hour of misery and despair; it always does so, it cannot
                  be put off for ever; even on a visit to a dentist, as my childhood can attest with
                  bitter experience, we are not for ever getting there; the fatal door too surely
                  dawns upon us, and our heart, which for the last half hour has been gradually
                  sinking lower and lower, until we almost doubt its existence, vanishes suddenly
                  downwards into depths hitherto undreamed of. And so, I repeat it, the hour came at
                  last.
               Standing before that base mechanic's door, with a throbbing and expectant heart,
                  my eye chanced to fall once more upon that signboard, once more I perused its
                  strange inscription. Oh! fatal change! Oh! horror! What do I see? Have I been
                  deluded by a heated imagination? A hideous gap yawns between the N and the C,
                  making it not one word but two!
               And the dream was over.
               At the corner of the street I turned to take a sad fond look at the spectre of a
                  phantom hope, I once had held so dear. Adieu!" I whispered; this was all the last
                  farewell I took, and I leant upon my walking-stick and wiped away a tear. On the
                  following day I entered into commercial relations with the firm of Dumpy and
                  Spagg, wholesale dealers in the wine and spirit department.
               The signboard yet creaks upon the mouldering wall, but its 
                     souud
                     sound
                   shall make music in these ears never more—ah! never more.
            
            
               THE POETICAL YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
               
                  
                  TIME was, not very long ago either, when a singular epidemic raged
                  among the young gentlemen, vast numbers of whom, under the influence of the
                  malady, tore off their neckerchiefs, turned down their shirt collars, and
                  exhibited themselves in the open streets with bare throats and dejected
                  countenances, before the eyes of an astonished public. These were poetical young
                  gentlemen. The custom was gradually found to be inconvenient, as involving the
                  necessity of too much clean linen, and too large washing bills and these outward
                  symptoms have consequently passed away; but we are disposed to think,
                  notwithstanding, that the number of poetical young gentlemen is considerably on
                  the increase.
               We know a poetical young gentleman—a very poetical young gentleman. We do not mean
                  to say that he is troubled with the gift of poesy in any remarkable degree, but
                  his countenance is of a plaintive and melancholy cast, his manner is abstracted
                  and bespeaks affliction of soul: he seldom has his hair cut, and often talks about
                  being an outcast and wanting a kindred spirit; from which, as well as from many
                  general observations in which he is wont to indulge, concerning mysterious
                  impulses, and yearnings of the heart, and the supremacy of intellect gilding all
                  earthly things with the glowing magic of immortal verse, it is clear to all his
                  friends that he has been stricken poetical.
               
                  
               
               The favorite attitude of the poetical young gentleman is lounging on a sofa with
                  his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, or sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair,
                  starring with very round eyes at the opposite wall. When he is in one of these
                  positions, his mother, who is a worthy affectionate old soul, will give you a
                  nudge to bespeak your attention without
                  disturbing the abstracted one, and whisper with a shake of the head, that John's
                  imagination is at some extraordinary work or other, you may take her word for it.
                  Hereupon John looks more fiercely intent upon vacancy than before, and suddenly
                  snatching a pencil from his pocket, puts down three words, and a cross on the back
                  of a card, sighs deeply, paces once or twice across the room, inflicts a most
                  unmerciful slap upon his head, and walks moodily up to his dormitory.
               The poetical young gentleman is apt to acquire peculiar notions of things, too,
                  which plain ordinary people, unblessed with a poetical obliquity of vision, would
                  suppose to be rather distorted. For instance, when the sickening murder and
                  mangling of a wretched woman was affording delicious food wherewithal to gorge the
                  insatiable curiosity of the public, our friend the poetical young gentleman was in
                  ecstasies—not of disgust, 
                     bnt
                     but
                   admiration. "Heavens!" cried the poetical young gentleman, "how grand;
                  how great!" We ventured deferentially to inquire upon whom these epithets were
                  bestowed: our humble thoughts oscillating between the police officer who found the
                  criminal, and the lock-keeper who found the head. "Upon whom!" exclaimed the
                  poetical young gentleman in a frenzy of poetry, "Upon whom should they be bestowed
                  but upon the murderer!"—and thereupon it came out, in a fine torrent of eloquence,
                  that the murderer was a great spirit, a bold creature full of daring and nerve, a
                  man of dauntless heart and determined courage, and withal a great casuist and able
                  reasoner, as was fully demonstrated in his philosophical colloquies with the great
                  and noble of the land. We held our peace, and meekly signified our indisposition
                  to controvert these opinions—firstly, because we were no match at quotation for
                  the poetical young gentleman; and secondly, because we felt it would be of little
                  use our entering into any disputation, if we were: being perfectly convinced that
                  the respectable and immortal hero in question is not the first and will not be the
                  last hanged gentleman upon whom false sympathy or diseased curiosity will be
                  plentifully expended.
               This was a stern mystic flight of the poetical young gentleman. In his milder and
                  softer moments he occasionally lays down his neckcloth, and pens stanzas, which
                  sometimes find their way into a Lady's Magazine, or, the "Poets' Corner" of some
                  country newspaper; or which, in default of either vent for his genius, adorn the
                  rainbow leaves of a lady's album. These are generally written upon some such
                  occasions as contemplating the Bank of England by midnight, or beholding Saint
                  Paul's in a snow storm; and when these gloomy objects fail to afford him
                  inspiration, he pours forth his soul in a touching address to a violet, or a
                  plaintive lament that he is no longer a child, but has gradually grown up.
               The poetical young gentleman is fond of quoting passages from his favorite
                  authors, who are all of the gloomy and desponding school. He has a great deal to
                  say too about the world, and is much given to opining, especially if he has taken
                  anything strong to drink, that there is nothing worth living for. He gives you to
                  understand, however, that for the sake of society, he means to bear his part in
                  the tiresome play, manfully resisting the gratification of his own strong desire
                  to make a premature exit; and consoles himself with the reflection, that
                  immortality has some chosen nook for himself and the other great spirits whom
                  earth has chafed and wearied.
               When the poetical young gentleman makes use of adjectives, they are all
                  superlatives. Everything is of the grandest, greatest, noblest, mightiest,
                  loftiest; or the lowest, meanest, obscurest, vilest, and most pitiful. He knows no
                  medium; for enthusiasm is the soul of poetry; and who so enthusiastic as a
                  poetical young gentleman? "Mr. Milkwash," says a young lady as she unlocks her
                  album to receive the young gentleman's original impromptu contribution, "how very
                  silent you are! I think you must be in love." "Love!" cries the poetical young
                  gentleman, starting from his seat by the fire and terrifying the cat, who scampers
                  off at full speed, "Love! that burning consuming passion; that ardor of the soul,
                  that fierce glowing of the heart. Love! That withering blighting influence of hope
                  misplaced and affection slighted. Love did you say! Ha! ha! ha!"
               With this, the poetical young gentleman laughs a laugh belonging only to poets,
                  and Mr. 0. Smith of the Adelphi Theatre, and sits down, pen in hand, to throw off
                  a page or two of verse in the biting, semi-atheistical demoniac style, which, like
                  the poetical young gentleman himself, is full of sound and fury, signifying
                  nothing.
            
            
               
               CONJUGATING A VERB.
               
                  
                  ONCE ON a time, Dick Orrod and his brother Giles were fine specimens
                  of the bumpkin boys of the West of England: their father, who was a flourishing
                  farmer, sent them to pick up a little learning at an expensive academy in a large
                  town about twenty miles from the village where he lived. The master had but
                  recently purchased the school from his predecessor; and, stranger as he was to the
                  dialect of that part of the country, he could scarcely understand above one-half
                  of what Dick and Giles Orrod, and a few more of his pupils meant when they spoke.
                  "I knowed, I rinned, and I hut," were
                  barbarisms to which his ear had never been accustomed; and it was only by degrees
                  he discovered that they were translations into the rural tongue, of "I knew, I
                  ran, I hit." But there were few so rude of speech as Dick and Giles Orrod.
               Fraternal affection was a virtue that did not flourish in the bosoms of either of
                  these young gentlemen. Dick's greatest enemy on earth was Giles; and if honest
                  Giles hated any human being except the master, it was Dick. They were excellent
                  spies upon each other's conduct; Giles never missed an opportunity of procuring
                  Dick a castigation; and Dick was equally active in making the master acquainted
                  with every punishable peccadillo that his brother committed.
               One day an accusation was preferred against Master Richard, by one of the
                  monitors, of having cut down a small tree in the shrubbery; but there was not
                  sufficient evidence to bring the offence home to the supposed culprit.
               "Does no young gentleman happen to know anything more of this matter?" inquired
                  the master.
               Giles immediately walked from his seat, and taking a place by the side of his
                  brother, looked as though he had something relevant to communicate.
               "Well, sir;" said the master, "what do you know about the tree?"
               "If you plaze, sir," growled Giles, "if you plaze, sir, I sawed un."
               "Oh! you 'sawed un,' did you?"
               "Iss I did: Dick seed I sawed un."
               "Is this true, Master Richard?"
               "Iss," said Dick: and Giles, much to his astonishment, was immediately
                  flogged.
               At the termination of the ceremony, it occurred to the master to ask Giles, how he
                  obtained the saw. "About your saw, young gentleman:" said he, "where do you get a
                  saw when you want one?"
               Giles had some faint notions of grammar floating in his brain, and thinking that
                  the master meant the verb, and not the substantive, blubbered out—"From
                     see."
               "Sea!—so you go on board the vessels in the dock, do you, out of
                  school hours, and expend your pocket money in purchasing implements to cut down my
                  shrubbery?"
               "Noa, sir," said Giles, "I doant goa aboard no ships, nor cut down noa
                  shrubberies."
               "What, sirrah! did you not confess it?"
               "Noa, sir; I said I sawed brother Dick cut down the tree, and he seed I sawed un,
                  and a' couldn't deny it."
               "I didn't deny it."
               "Then possibly you are the real delinquent, after all, Master Richard," exclaimed
                  the master.
               Dick confessed that he was, but he hoped the master would not beat him, after
                  having flogged his brother for the same offence; in his way, he humbly submitted
                  that one punishment, no matter who received it,—but especially as it had been
                  bestowed on one of the same family as the delinquent,—was, to all intents and
                  purposes, enough for one crime.
               The master, however, did not coincide with Dick on this grave point, and the young
                  gentleman was duly horsed.
               "As for Master Giles," said the master, as he laid down the birch, "he well
                  merited a flogging for his astonishing—his wilful stupidity. If boys positively
                  will not profit by my instructions, I am bound, in duty to their parents, to try
                  the effect of castigation. No man grieves more sincerely than I do, at the
                  necessity which exists for using the birch and cane as instruments of liberal
                  education; and yet, unfortunately, no
                  man, I verily believe, is compelled to use them more frequently than myself. I was
                  occupied for full half an hour, in drumming this identical verb into Giles Orrod,
                  only yesterday morning: and you, sir," added he, turning to Dick, "you, I suppose
                  are quite as great a blockhead as your brother. Now attend to me both of
                  you:—what's the past of see?"
               Neither of the young gentlemen replied.
               "I thought as much!" quoth the master. "The perfect of see is the
                  present of saw,—SEE, SAW."
               "SEE, SAW," shouted the boys; but that unfortunate verb was the stumbling-block to
                  their advancement. They never could comprehend how the perfect of see could be the
                  present of saw; and days, weeks, months,—nay, years after,—they were still at
                  their endless, and, to them, incomprehensible game of SEE-SAW.
            
            
               ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN FLAG.
               
                  Studdid up whilst settin onto the Piazzy fence, watchin of the American Flag
                     wavin from the Liberty Poal, and tetchin off of fire-crackers now and then, on
                     the forth of July.

                     Made of red and white and blue stripes,
                     And stars painted on both sides—

                     How as when you was leetle, and not much
                     Bigger than a peese of cloth, and
                     Almost as tender as a sheet of paper, you
                     Was karried all thru the revolution-
                     Ary war, and hev sum feu times sense

                     Jest as if I shud bust and fli all round, and want
                     Tu git down off the fense, and git shot,
                     Or stabbed, or hit on the hed with a stick
                     Uv wood, or hung for my kuntry.
                  
                  
                     Prodigious banner! Wouldn't I smile to see
                     A Chinaman, or a small unnateheralized
                     Furriner undertaik to pull yu down!
                     
                     If a Chinaman, I would fix him, and kut
                     Of his kew, and bear it off in triumf:
                     Before I'd see a split torn in ye, or the sakrilejus
                     Hands of a fo kuttin yu into bullit
                     Patchin, I'd brace my back agin a waul (or a 
                     House, or a fence, or a board, as it mite be,)
                     And fite, and strike, and skratch, and

                     Agin, and kontinu the struggle for heff or
                     Three-quarters of an hour, or until I got
                     Severely wounded.
                  
                  
                     Terrific emblem! How prowd you look,
                     And how almity sassy you waiv round,
                     Snappin and cracken, and skeerin of horses;
                     I spose yure almost tarrin to git into a

                     Niverous disposition by eatin up a whole nashun!
                  
                  
                     Great flag! I don't no which maiks me feel the
                     Most patriotic—yu or the forth of July:
                     Yu aint made of the same kind of stuff, altho
                     Yu are about the same age, and are both
                     Sublimed, and terrible to kontemnplate.
                  
                  
                     But I must klose and waiv my last adew,
                     However tryin to my feelins it may be,
                     And get down off the fense, for already the

               CONFESSIONS OF A REJECTED SUITOR.
               
                  
                  MY HAND trembles and my cheeks are conscious of a blush, as I seize
                  my gray goose-quill to tell of my own shame. Why then do I not keep it secret? Why
                  publish what I might keep hidden in the recesses of my own heart? Because, good
                  friend, I feel myself an injured man, and if that will not make a man
                  speak out he must be dumb indeed. Did you ever know a man with a grievance who
                  kept it to himself? Did you ever know one who was not for ever dragging it into
                  conversation, à propos of free trade, the
                  Crystal Palace, the Siege of Sebastopol, or the Spanish Dancers? Meet such a man
                  and begin to talk to him (if you dare) on any conceivable subject, and I'll wager
                  my hat—which is a new one—to a penny roll, that within two minutes he will be deep
                  in the matter of his own grievance, as though it sprang out of, or formed an
                  essential part of, the topic you started. There are accomplished little boys much
                  beloved by burglars, who, if they can only get their heads through an orifice of
                  any kind, can always drag their bodies through after them. The man with a
                  grievance only wants to get a word in, and his "grievance" will
                  safely follow.
               And why then am I to be silent?
               When every other injured man proclaims his wrongs to the world, why should not
                     I tell of the cruel injustice I suffered from that cold-blooded,
                  heartless, jilting——? but hold—I must not jump too quickly "in medias res," in
                  spite of Horace's injunction.
               Miss Lavinia Primrose (I describe her according to my former impressions) was a
                  sweet pretty girl. She had the mildest of blue eyes, the lightest of flaxen
                  hair—which she wore in ringlets all round her head—the whitest of skins, with the pinkest of
                  colors on her cheeks, the plumpest of little figures, and the softest of voices
                  that ever whispered sonnets of moonlight in December. She was an ethereal creature
                  altogether: she had the appetite of a little bird (though that brute Tom Bagshaw
                  swears she ate like a cormorant at the nursery dinner): she knew Byron and Moore
                  by heart—except "Little's Poems," which she always vowed she had never even seen
                  (ahem!): she wrote verses herself, too, though somehow or other the lines were
                  never quite of the same length—she said it was the luxuriance of her
                  imagination, and I have no doubt it was: she sang with intense feeling but a
                     leetle out of tune; she painted flowers beautifully (though Tom
                  Bagshaw, the wretch, declared that no one could tell her roses from hollyhocks);
                  in short, she was a most accomplished and romantic little angel. Tom Bagshaw, in
                  his coarse way, once asked her if she could make pease-pudding—I could have
                  strangled the scoundrel on the spot. She gave him such a mild look of reproach
                  that he must have shuddered in his boots at his own enormity, if he had not been
                  as thick-skinned as the toughest of "Pachydermata," and only replied—
               "Mr. Bagshaw!"
               Old Primrose (Lavinia's papa) was a retired soap-boiler, very rich, very fat, very
                  vulgar, very obstinate, and very ill-tempered. Mrs. Primrose had been for some
                  time gathered to her forefathers (though Tom declares she never had any). There
                  were two juvenile Primroses—young ladies in short frocks and frilled
                  encasements-of-the-lower-limbs—about twelve and thirteen years of age, and under
                  the care of a middle-aged maiden, their governess. The family lived in a square
                  red-brick house, with bright green "trimming" in the shape of Venetian blinds,
                  balconies, and railings to the front garden, the extent of which was extremely
                  limited. I forgot to mention that the house was situate in the centre of the
                  highly-respectable town of Bodalming.
               I, good reader, am a clerk in the bank in that town, and I receive a very handsome
                  salary (95l. a year) for my attendance from ten till three every day
                  behind the wire-blind, with "Bank" in gold letters on it, where I do a little
                  office-writing and compose verses for the poets' corner of the "County Herald." I
                  send copies to all my friends, and to all the magazine offices. The former praise
                  them very much; but those magazine fellows are so rude as never to notice them at
                  all.
               My mama, being one of the most respectable ladies in Bodalming, was almost the
                  first person to call on the Primroses when they came to settle in our town. Not
                  that she much likes "those city people," she says: from which, I suppose that she
                  prefers West-End folks, but as she never sees any to my knowledge, I cannot
                  exactly state the grounds of her preference. However, she paid her visit and I
                  accompanied her. I cannot say that I liked old Primrose, who called mama "mum,"
                  and me "young gentleman"—but his daughter! Ye gods, could I ever have conceived
                  such fascinations! I blushed up to my ears every time she spoke to me, and trod on
                  my own hat (smashing it like a Gibus) in my haste to prevent her helping me to a
                  glass of wine. I tried to talk, but I couldn't, though as soon as I had left the
                  house, I recollected everything that I wanted to say, and wondered why I could
                  have been such a fool as not to say it at the proper time. Next week the "County
                  Herald" contained the following lines "To L——a" from our own talented contributor,
                  W. T."—meaning Walsingham Tripps, myself:— 
                     
                        "Lady with the flaxen locks,
                        Clust'ring on thy snowy brow—
                        Lady with the pearly teeth,
                        Who so beautiful as thou?
                     
                     
                        Lady, when thine upward look
                        Those sweet azure orbs displays,
                        Who shall keep his heart unscathed
                        'Neath the lightning of their gaze?
                     
                     
                        Art thou mortal? art thou not
                        From some brighter, purer sphere,
                        Sent to raise our thoughts from earth—
                        Sent to grov'ling mortals here?
                     
                     
                        Lady, dare I think of thee
                        With sublunary emotion,
                        Feebly would my pen declare
                        All my fond, my deep devotion.
                     
                     
                        But, alas! could thy perfection
                        Cast one thought on such as I?
                        Ah, no—away—the thought is madness—
                        Hopeless, tearless, let me die!"
                     
                  
               
               I sent Lavinia a copy, and I wondered whether she would know whose initials "W.
                  T." were. I felt sure that she would pity me if she did, for it was evident enough
                  that I was very miserable. However, I had no one to confide in; for the only
                  conversible young man in the town was
                  that horrid Tom Bagshaw, who positively mutilated my copy of the above verses by
                  scratching out "tearless," and sticking in "brainless." But he's brute.
               Meanwhile the Primroses returned our call, and then they invited us to take tea
                  with them, which we did; and then we invited them to take tea with us, which they
                  did. At about the second or third interview my diffidence began to wear off, and I
                  ventured to talk my best to the lovely Lavinia. But I found myself woefully behind
                  her in some departments of literature. She had read all the new novels, and all
                  the new poetry, and talked about poets whose names were quite unknown to me.
               "You are fond of poetry, then?" I said, inquiringly.
               "I adore it," she replied. "I could never live without it. I am sure, if ever I
                  lose my heart," she added, with the prettiest little blush in the world "it will
                  be to a——"
               "Trump!" shouted Papa Primrose, at the whist-table, dashing down a card, and
                  drowning with his hoarse voice the rest of his daughter's sentence.
               "Have you ever read the 'County Herald?'" I asked, after a pause.
               "Ah, no," she exclaimed, "I abhor newspapers—they're detestable."
               "Yes—exactly so,—but you see," I replied, "there is a poets' corner in the 'County
                  Herald' where—"
               "Where Mr. Tripps poetizes perhaps" interrupted Lavinia with a sly look, while I
                  blushed like a peony—"ah, that alters the case. I shall certainly read the 'County
                  Herald' now. And that reminds me, some one sent me one—I must look at it."
               My heart thumped as if it were determined to come right through my waistcoat.
               A week afterwards I was sitting in the office, when Tom Bagshaw came in to chat
                  with me.
               "By-the-by, Walsy," he said, "have you seen the 'Herald' this week?"
               I had not; for the truth is, I knew there was nothing of mine in it, and that was
                  all I ever looked for. As for murders and burglaries, free trade, and the state of
                  the crops, which filled the rest of the paper, I cared not one button for any of
                  them. However, Tom said it was worth looking at; and there was such a peculiar
                  expression in his face as he said so, that I sent for the paper the moment he had
                  gone, I looked to "poets' corner," and read the following:—
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "TO W. T.
                              
                              
                                 Youth of talents rich and rare,
                                 Poet of exalted mind,
                                 Thinkest thou the 'azure orbs'
                                 Are to thy perfections blind?
                              
                              
                                 Poet, dost thou wish to end
                                 What so well thou hast begun?

                                 But, ah! believe she may be won!
                                 
                              
                              
                                 L. P."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               I read the lines again, and I was so frantic with delight that I shouted "Huzzah!"
                  Whereupon one of the partners in the bank, a very quiet old gentleman, rushed into
                  the room, exclaiming,
               "Good heavens! Mr. Tripps, what's the matter?"
               I am sure I cannot recollect what I said in reply. My explanation was, I fear,
                  very unsatisfactory, for the old gentleman left the room muttering something about
                  "a strait waistcoat." But I cared nothing for all the old gentlemen in the world
                  at that moment. The signature was "L. P." too. She had seen my verses—she had
                  replied—she could love me, then—she should be mine!"
               That evening I sat by Lavinia as she poured out tea for us in her papa's
                  drawing-room. By the way, I must confess that she made very bad tea; it was
                  undeniably "sloppy." But she had a soul above tea; and in my opinion it was a
                  desecration of that lovely form to stick it down to a tea-table at all.
               "Is there anything new in the 'County Herald' this week, Mr. Tripps?" asked
                  Lavinia, in the calmest and coolest of tones. I was really staggered, and almost
                  shocked at her imperturbability. However, I replied—
               "Indeed there is," with an accent and a glance which I expected to make her fair
                  cheek mantle with blushes. I was mistaken, though, for she never colored at
                  all—while she asked—
               "What is it? What is the subject?"
               No!—hang it! I thought, this won't do. I may have been rather too
                  diffident at first, and of course it was very kind of her to help me on a little.
                  But to ask me to tell her that there are her own verses addressed to me—upon my
                  soul I don't think it's quite delicate. Suddenly the idea struck me that she did
                  not expect her verses to appear this week. However, she
                  had gone to another part of the room and returned with a little volume, bound in
                  pale blue satin, elaborately gilt, and entitled "The Loves of the Flowers."
               
               "Have you seen this?" she inquired.
               I had not; and I may remark, that I have never been able to find any one that had,
                  excepting Lavinia herself; which only proves, of course, that it was a very rare
                  work.
               
                  
               
               Lavinia declared that it was exquisite; full of the truest pathos; the work
                  evidently of one who had loved and suffered, she said, with a sigh that seemed to
                  insinuate that she herself had loved and suffered.
               My heart began thumping again: I gave her such a look! I think she
                  felt its meaning; for she cast down her eyes. I grew bolder.
               "Miss Primrose," I said, "a heart like yours could be thoroughly and deservedly
                  appreciated by but few. Yet methinks there is one who would prize such a jewel
                  beyond—" here I stammered a little and said, "anything." Confound it! the poetry
                  never will come at the right moment. Lavinia began to blush now in
                  earnest. My courage increased.
               "Believe me, dear Miss Primrose (may I say Lavinia?) believe me, I am not a——"
               "Trump!" shouted that infernal Papa Primrose again, thumping down a card and
                  scattering all my poetry and all my "pluck" to the winds together.
               What I said afterwards I never have been able to recollect; I only know that I
                  stuttered awfully, while Lavinia blushed and stared and murmured something about
                  my being "mistaken." Whereupon I began to feel almost indignant; and alluded, in
                  rather plain terms, to her own verses.
               I never shall forget her admirably acted (for of course it was acted)
                  look of amazement, as she asked me what I meant. Nor shall I ever forget my own
                  embarrassment when I had actually to recite her own verses to her. At the
                  conclusion she positively burst out into a fit of laughter, which drew upon us the
                  notice of the whist table; and old Primrose asked—
               "What's the joke, eh?" (joke, indeed!)
               Lavinia replied—"Oh, Mr. Tripps is saying such droll things," and never shall I
                  forget her malicious look at me as she spoke.
               Next day I applied for a month's holiday, and started up to town to get away from
                  the scene of my discomfiture and my ruined hopes. I was thoroughly wretched, and
                  wrote pages of blank verse cursing fate and Cupid, and woman-kind, and everything
                  but my own folly.
               One morning, the general post brought me a letter with the Bodalming post-mark. It
                  was from Tom Bagshaw, and as follows:— 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "DEAR WALSY,—
                              
                              Congratulate me! I am a happy man. I am going to marry the
                                 Primrose. The old gentleman consents, like a trump as he is, and
                                 comes down with a decent 'subsidy' on the occasion. But then you
                                 know my own prospects are devilish good. However, I am not going to
                                 trouble you with a list of our arrangements. My principal object is
                                 to beg you to come down and to be my groomsman. We are to be
                                 spliced on the fourth of next month. I am sure you won't refuse,
                                 old fellow, will you? By-the-by, were you not a little bit spoony
                                 in the same quarter yourself once? I think so: but you needn't be
                                 afraid or ashamed to own it—for Livvy is a girl any man might be
                                 proud of—though I have quizzed her pretty well, as you
                                 know. But that's all over now; and like a good little girl, she has
                                 given up 'The Loves of the Flowers,' and is studying 'Soyer's
                                 Modern Housewife' instead.
                              
                                 "Ever yours, dear Walsy,
                                 "THOS. BAGSHAW.
                              
                           
                           
                              "P S. By the way, I hope you have forgiven me for the hoax about the verses 'To W.
                                 T.' I give you my word of honor they are the only specimens of
                                 rhyme I ever attempted in my life."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               I hope the reader does not suppose that I believed in this miserable
                  subterfuge, or that I doubt to this day that Lavinia Primrose wrote
                  these verses. But, no matter.
            
            
               A TICKLISH POSITION.
               
                  
                  OF two possible fates I always had a supreme dread; one was that I
                  should be buried alive; the other that I should be executed, on circumstantial
                  evidence, for a murder of which I was innocent. Against the former I have provided
                  by inserting a clause in my will, whereby I give and bequeath my body for
                  dissection to a hospital; I will not mention what one in particular, lest the
                  temptation be too strong for aspiring anatomists, and so I perish prematurely.
                  With regard to my second source of alarm, I have long since felt the impossibility
                  of taking precautions; and the purport of this present history is to show how
                  inconveniently near I was, on one occasion, to the realization of my preconceived
                  fears on the subject.
               Even had I not experienced presentiments on the matter, you will, I am sure, when
                  you have heard me out, agree that my adventure was what I have entitled it above,
                  "a ticklish position;" but with this previous idea in my mind to add new horror to
                  the reality, it was indeed frightful, and my sensations were such as I pray it may
                  never be my lot or yours, good reader, to experience either again, or, in your
                  case, for the first time.
               I had been spending an evening in the style of the Red Cross Knight, that is,
                  "right merrilie," with some very old friends. It was not a formal, stuck-up,
                  three-weeks-previous-invitation affair, which involves a ridiculous expenditure in
                  useless white kids, and renders that acme of abominations, a
                  swallow-tailed dress-coat, compulsory; neither had I been dishonestly decoyed, by
                  a solicitation "to meet a few friends in a quiet way," into presenting myself in
                  my every-day attire amongst a circle of extensively-got-up people, of which I, as
                  far as regarded rude remarks and vulgar observation, should form the uncomfortable
                  centre. No, my good friend Mrs. Merryface was not the woman to perpetrate this
                  villanous outrage on any of her fellow-creatures; and though none knew better than
                  herself how to do the thing well when a regular kick-up was in question, yet the
                  little gathering I allude to was not of this kind at all. It had all the elements
                  of a "party," minus the starch, and that is the kind of thing I
                  adore; and so I had been proportionately happy on the occasion in question. I
                  can't however afford space to analyse the evening; I wish I could. Let it only be
                  said there were old Merryface and his jolly wife. They had got two
                  other "fogeys" (I adopt their own term) to join them in a rubber, so as not to
                  draw upon the youngsters; these fogeys had brought an unquestionable importation
                  of daughters who, I have reason to know, made terrific havoc in the hearts of one
                  or two of my chums then and there present; there was young Tom Merryface, who
                  amused us by discoursing anything but eloquent music from his cornet-à-piston, his
                  performances being at length stopped, to our great gratification—by an imploring
                  message from a united happy family (friends of the Merryfaces, but still only
                  human in their powers of endurance); who lived next door, sundered by a single
                  brick wall; and there was Nelly Merryface, about whom I reserve to myself the
                  right of being mysteriously silent, for private reasons of my own (connected with
                  a sotto voce conversation Nelly and I had on the
                  stairs that evening; for we had put back the tables after supper, and had a dance,
                  and the room got remarkably hot, so much so indeed that Nelly and I found it
                  absolutely necessary to adjourn). As I said before, I cannot dwell on all this,
                  but you must suppose it all to have taken place, and me—the last of the remaining
                  guests—to be taking my departure, somewhere about two in the morning.
               The last lingering good-night was said (never mind to whom—that's my
                  business), and Tom and I were in the passage.
               "Got a pipe, old fellow?" said Tom; for at the period of which I write we each
                  inclined to the noxious weed (but Nelly hates smoking, and so I have
                  given it up some time since).
               I produced a calumet, of the species technically termed "cutty," legitimately foul, and which excited Tom's intense
                  admiration as "coloring beautifully;" that is, it was somewhere about the color of
                  a Crimean shako.
               "Light up, then," he continued, "I'll set you a bit on your way. I don't feel in
                  the least beddish. What nonsense of 'em to go so early?"
               And so we wandered along, puffing like two locomotives. We walked together as far
                  as the Central Park, and there stood for a few minutes, re-loading pipes and
                  arranging for our next merry meeting.
               Tom was a short thickish fellow, and, with eccentric taste, had lately been paying
                  a distinguished pugilist to batter him about with the view of learning
                  experimentally the noble art of bruising.
               We had practised a bit during the evening, and a final spar on the common
                  appearing mutually advisable, we indulged in an amicable scuffle, which ended in
                  Tom's rushing off homewards like a maniac, after kindly knocking my pipe out of my
                  mouth.
               "Confound the fellow!" I ejaculated: "now ten to one, he has pitched my pipe into
                  the ditch;" for just where we separated, the wall of a large house skirts the
                  green, and there is a muddy but not very deep ditch running alongside the wall.
                  "Oh here we are," I added, as, after a good deal of groping, I found my little
                  companion. On attempting to refil it, however, I found it was wet, not with water,
                  but with some sticky, slimy substance, which, when rubbed on my hand, looked like
                  the superfluous oil of a foul pipe; so I put it in my pocket, determined to give
                  it a good cleaning on the morrow, and wandered on pipeless.
               Bereft of the companionship of my kindred clay—in every sense of the word—I
                  thought I might as well get over the ground as quickly as possible, and
                  accordingly set off to run, bidding a hasty "good-night" in response to a passing
                  policeman (at whose civility I much wondered, considering his prospect of a
                  night's promenade in that rather cut-throat locality—which I felt might not
                  unreasonably have rendered him misanthropical).
               I had not run above a hundred yards when I heard a rattle sprung behind me, which
                  I imagined must proceed from my friend in the Blues, above-mentioned. For a moment
                  the love of adventure prompted me to turn back and aid the cause of justice; but
                  the idea that it was probably nothing more than a refractory drunkard, and the
                  likelihood of having to appear in the morning to hear him fined five
                  shillings—joined with just a tinge of dread lest I should experience assault and
                  battery myself—and coming in conjunction with a very decided preference ence for
                  my turn-up bedstead, caused me first to waver, then to turn again decisively
                  eastward, and finally to resume my run with fresh vigor.
               But the further I ran, the more the noise increased behind me; fresh rattles
                  reverberated in the quiet morning, lights began to gleam, and finally, the cry of
                  "stop him" became distinctly audible. I was still running, but just about to pause
                  once more, when a second member of the executive emerged from a dark corner, and
                  stopped me. He civily desired me to excuse him if he were wrong, to which I
                  replied by assuring him I had no objection to wait for his comrades who were now
                  close at hand. So we stood under a lamp-post.
               "Have you got him?" said my former friend, scrutinising me with his bull's eye
                  lantern; "all right, that's him."
               "What is it?" said my captor; "the gentleman stopped of his own accord."
               "When you'd got hold of 'im, I s'pose," returned the last arrival in blue,
                  facetiously.
               There was now a slight crowd.
               "But what is it?" repeated my detainer.
               "Why am I detained?" I asked indignantly.
               "There, you'd better say nuffin, young man," he replied to me, dimly
                  and unconsolingly. "Z 41, you hold him fast. There's only been A MURDER in the
                  Park!"
               "A murder!" the crowd exclaimed.
               "A murder!" I fairly shrieked. "In heaven's name who is murdered?"
                  for a thought of Tom crossed my mind, and I was in an agony.
               "P'raps you can tell us that," said my first acquaintance among the police, who
                  was bound and lettered Z 38.
               "Bring him on to the station. We shall pass the place; p'raps you'll remember who
                  'tis then. You'd better say nuffin," he repeated, as, in my
                  bewilderment, I was going to make some observation—I have not the
                  least idea what. I had no resource but to be silent and go.
               "I say, Bobby," said a cabman, who had eyes more penetrating than the rest of the
                  group, though it numbered several of the Z division, "I say, Bobby, look at his
                  trowsers!"
               The police looked, and I looked. I was horrified to find the bottoms of my
                  trowsers and my boots red, and apparently saturated with blood!
               The executive nodded mysteriously and led me on.
               At last we reached the horrid spot, and there, stark and stiff, and hideous in the uncertain light, lay the pale,
                  ghastly form of the murdered man. There was one consolation: it was
                     not my old friend Tom though from the similarity of build, and the
                  difficulty of identifying the mud-stained features, I was for a moment uncertain
                  on that point.
               A bemuddled witness here volunteered the information that "He was a-comin out o'
                  the public on the green, an' see'd the two men come up the road, and heard 'em
                  a-scufflin' but thought 'twas only in joke, so went on 'till he heard the whistles
                  and so come back. An' that's all I knows," said he.
               "Come with us to the station," said Z 38, majestically. And on we strode
                  again.
               To think that all at home were hushed in slumber, dreaming not of the demon of ill
                  that hovered over their house! To know that within a few hundred yards, my dear
                  friends—and she the dearest, though the newest, in the recent tie that this night
                  had made her almost mine—were quietly sleeping! To know they were so near and yet
                  so unconscious—so impotent had they been there, that I was even happy for their
                  absence! (Happy gracious Heaven!) Whilst I, so late their favored guest and—never
                  mind the warmer title—was being dragged past their door a suspected
                     murderer! My brain was overtaxed: I fainted; and on recovery found
                  myself at the Police Station, undergoing the flattering process of being searched.
                  My watch, purse, handkerchief, were severally removed and systematically examined.
                  The last mentioned article was scrutinised most carefully, and handed round, as I
                  fancied, in triumph, though I knew there could be nothing there to criminate me;
                  but I heard Z 38 distinctly enunciate the word "blood." Then came the pipe: I
                  needn't fear that. What did I see? It was literally soaked with
                  blood! That was the slimy substance I had felt. The pipe was passed round as a
                  trophy, and I was incarcerated.
               To describe the moments I spent there—moments which dragged along like hours—would
                  need an abler pen than mine. I saw that I was indeed in evil case; for the whole
                  story seemed perfect in its details, as if it had been contrived expressly for my
                  destruction.
               The fellow at the public house had seen two men come up the road
                  together: observed that one was tall, the other short and square-built (could not
                  swear that the latter was the murdered man, but felt morally certain); then he
                  heard the scuffle (he did not see my friend rush away; he had
                  probably left the public house before Tom did so): then Policeman Z 38 had seen me
                  rushing madly from the spot: he noticed (so he said) my agitated
                  reply to his salutation: a moment afterwards, examining the ditch with his
                  lantern, he discovered the body: I was pursued and captured: my trousers were
                  found to be blood-stained: I could give no account of the cause (I had been
                  silenced with "Better say nuffin," when I tried): then came the
                  search at the station-house; my handkerchief had several spots of blood on it,
                  from being in contact with the pipe: but the most damning piece of evidence of all
                  was the pipe itself, which seemed to have been dropped into a pool of blood by
                  accident, and then (as they naturally supposed) thrust hastily into my pocket
                  previous to my flight, lest it should lead to my identification!
               
                  
               
               When I reviewed the chain of evidence, in the silence of my terrible retirement, I
                  felt sure the long dreaded issue had at length arrived, and I was doomed to pay
                  the penalty of another's crime. It was too much for me. I became insensible again,
                  and remained so I know not how long; for I had ceased to measure time by the
                  sensations of ordinary mortals. When I did at length recover my faculties, it was
                  with a thrill of joy that I heard my friend Tom's voice pronounce my name, and in
                  a few minutes saw him by the straggling light of the grey dawn enter my
                  prison.
               He was attended by the inspector who had received the charge, and most of the officers concerned in the case, with
                  the bemuddled witness who had sought to swear away both my life and Tom's. "Don't
                  be too sudden," said the inspector, who thought I was asleep, "or you may do harm.
                  A reprieve is sometimes as fatal as an execution."
               A reprieve! Then it was all right! "My dear Tom," I exclaimed, springing from my
                  rude couch, and my strange position rendering me Hibernian in my observations, "my
                  dear Tom! Pray explain all this. Tell 'em you're not dead, and I haven't
                     murdered you!"
               He soon relieved me. The body was-not that of a murdered man, but a drunken
                  painter, who had been employed that day in painting a house, and had taken the
                  liberty of carrying off a little surplus RED PAINT with him. Missing the path, he
                  had rolled into the ditch, spilling the paint en
                     route; and here it was our fight had taken place, and I had dropped
                  my pipe.
               "And now, old fellow," said Tom, "come and have a shake-down at our place; I'll
                  make all right for you at home and in the City. You deserve a quiet day, I'm
                  sure."
               And so I slept beneath the same roof as, and spent all next day in company with,
                  Nelly. And (without going into other results, irrelevant to my present story) thus
                  happily ended my very "ticklish position."
            
            
               SHIRT BUTTONS!
               OR, THE AWFUL MISTAKE.
               
                  MISTAKES are common all through life,
                  A man Miss-takes, and she becomes his wife.
                  
                     
                  
                  In this, perhaps, they're both mistaken,
                  So never claim the flitch the bacon.
                  But such mistakes I'll let alone,
                  And now begin in serious tone.
               
               
                  An officer in quarters lay,
                  In Dublin—that, you'll say,
                  Is nothing very strange or sad.
                  True—true, but he was taken very bad.
                  And tho there's nothing new in that, 
                  Yet the prescription that he took to curb
                  His malady, I'm sure.
                  Was new, was wonderful, was strange.
                  And you may range
                  The Pharmacopœia o'er and o'er,
                  You'll not find anything more pat,
                  Tho' you should all your lifetime pore.
               
               
               
                  His case was fever, raging, burning;
                  He took to bed,
                  With fiery eyes, aching head,
                  And toss'd as if on glowing embers turning.
                  The doctor came—('twas very needful),
                  And he display'd his skill most heedful;
                  He wrote for pills and draughts, to drive
                  The devil out, dead or alive;
                  And, as the gentleman might still be worse,
                  He order'd, too,
                  (Quite right, you know),
                  A steady, careful, good old nurse;
                  And quickly to the patient came,
                  As recommended—the old dame.
                  She curtsied,—looked him in the face,
                  Shook her grey locks, and much deplored his case
                  "Och, honey! you are very ill;
                  But never mind,
                  We soon shall find
                  All your complaints,
                  By the good old Saint
                  Patrick, and the doctor's skill."
               
               
                  After this wise remark, I need not say,
                  You must not wonder,
                  Should she commit a blunder
                  In the Irish way.
                  I pr'ythee, gents, make no objection,
                  I do not mean the least reflection.
                  You'll recollect this is a case quite serious,
                  The patient lay in bed almost delirious,
                  The fever raging, in-his veins;
                  When soon arrived a draught to do him good,
                  And pill to quell the boiling of his blood,
                  And so to ease him of his pains.
               
               
                  Nurse poured the draught into a cup,
                  And soon the sick man drank it-up.
                  The box of pills with care she placed,
                  Where various things the mantel graced;
                  Because two hours must pass away,
                  To let the potion have fair play,
               
               
                  That time elapsed, nurse made all speed
                  The patient with the pills to feed.
                  She ope'd the box, and gave him two,
                  He gulp'd them down without ado.
                  Two more—and then two more must follow,
                  These rather stuck within his swallow.
                  "Good nurse some drink;"—he drank, and then,
                  Boldly attack'd the pills again.
               
               
                  Two more went down, and then two more,
                  Which made the number half a score.
                  "More drink!—so many is provoking,
                  My throat is full, I'm almost choking!"
                  "Arrah, my jewel, let me tell
                  You, these will shortly make you well,
                  Whether ye will or not—be easy,
                  And make a dozen up,—an't please ye."
                  Two more he took,—"I pr'vthee, say,
                  
                     
                  
                  Good nurse, how many there remains?"
                  "Two, four, five, seven, nine, ten, twelve,œay,
                  By Shelah, good St. Patrick's cousin,
                  
                  The box contains
                  Exactly another dozen!"
                  "A dozen more!" the sick man cries,
                  (Trembling with fever and surprise,)
                  "I thought apothecaries vended
                  By retail, till the patient mended,
                  But this, by Esculapius good,
                  By all that ever medicine understood,
                  This sells the poison wholesale!"
                  This boisterous gale
                  Of angry passion o'er,
                  She coaxed him to get down two more,
                  And thus, at length, he swallowed twenty-four!
               
               
                  Worn with fatigue, some time he lay,
                  To pain and angry thought a prey;
                  But soon his agony increased,
                  For, lo! the pills lay undigested,
                  Hard at his stomach they rested,
                  And fill'd with dreadful pain his breast.
               
               
                  The doctor must be call'd—he came,
                  Inquired each symptom, shrugg'd his shoulders;
                  He apprehended for his brain—
                  And for patients one or two beholders—
                  "Did you administer the draught?"—"Oh, yes."
                  "The pills?"—"'Tis they have caused all this,"
                  Exclaimed the officer. "Did you suppose
                  I was a horse, that you sent such a dose?
                  Damme, I've four-and-twenty bullets lying,"
                  "Bullets," repeats the doctor with surprise;
                  "Sir, I'm a man of peace, and either pill
                  I sent, was meant to cure, not to kill;
                  Besides, I sent but two," he straight replies,
                  "By heaven! I've swallow'd twenty-four," the sick man cries.
                  A squinting servant of the house stood by,
                  And towards the shelf she cast an eye;
                  She open'd the doctor's box, and there,
                  The pills both snug and safe appear,
                  Another box upon the shelf remain'd
                  Empty. "Why, nurse!" she squalls,
                  And at the doctor like a fury bawls,—
                  "This box, now empty, once contained
                  What the poor gentleman has taken;
                  Were he an ostrich, or the prince of gluttons,
                  You'd scarcely save his bacon;
                  For, by heaven!
                  You have given
                  Him two dozen round shirt buttons!"
               
            
            
               HUMPHREY PLOUGHSHARE IN LOVE.
               
                  
                  THE COUNTRY BOOR is considered by some persons as a very great
                     bore altogether; but, for our part, we always have looked upon a
                     "green-horn" as a very amusing wight,—and a simple
                  rustic clown as one of the most mirth-creating of all merry-Andrews.
                  Consequently, we have been interested observers of the eccentricities of the
                  country bumpkin, two or three of which we will illustrate by the following brief
                  narrative:—
               There are few men in his station of life who were more respected than honest old
                  Farmer Ploughshare, who had resided not a hundred miles from Ripon, in Yorkshire,
                  from childhood, and was admitted to the society of most of the country gentlemen
                  in the neighborhood.
               Farmer Ploughshare had an only son, who had arrived at the mature age of forty,
                  without having entered into the state of matrimony, and who was as rich a specimen
                  of a country "joskin," as ever graced a dung-fork, or embellished a
                  ploughtail.
               Humphrey Ploughshare was a simple, good-tempered, harmless fellow. His face was an
                  illustrated title-page to a volume of comicalities, bound in calf or
                     sheepskin. It was a stereotyped edition of Broadgrins and Facetiæ, and was well calculated to excite the risibility of all
                  who beheld it, even if they were the gravest individuals in existence.
               
               Humphrey Ploughshare once went a-courting. It was his first and last attempt in
                  that line, and a sad mess he made of it.
               The object of his tender passion was a buxom, red-faced, plump, chubby lass, who
                  lived "down at Squire's hard by," luxuriating in the somewhat unpoetic name of
                  Sally Grundy, and who was reported to have saved a goodly sum of money.
               Humphrey was brimful of love, but as bashful as a maid, and was sadly at a loss
                  how to prefer his suit, so as to obtain the preference
                  over his numerous rivals; and here we cannot do better than to repeat the account
                  of Humphrey Ploughshare's courtship, as given to us by his father, in the
                  following simple style:—
               "You mun know that my son did use to work wi' I in't field: that is, he drived
                  plough, sowed, mowed, reaped, tended th' sheep, and th' cows, and th' pigs, and
                  all other sorts o' cult'ral work loike; and a steady hard-working
                  lad he wur, too, till on a sudden, he becomed lazy loike, and wouldn't work at
                  all.
               "So, I couldn't tell what t' mak' on't;—if I snubb'd 'un, 'twur all th' same and
                  so at last, thinks I to mysen, I'll speak to 'un aboot 't, calmly loike,—and so I
                  did, and axed 'un what wur at matter wi' un; and so says he, 'I doesn't know
                  disactly, he, he, he! but ever sin' I seed Sally Grundy, at village church,
                  feyther, I ha' felt all over in sic' a conflagration, loike;—he, he,
                  he!'
               "'Why, thee ben't in love, be'st thee?'
               "'Why, I can't say for sartain, feyther,—haply I mought, haply I moughtn't, he,
                  he, he! but, dang my buttons, feyther, if I don't think as how Sally Grundy be'st
                  in love wi' I'
               "'Be she?' says I, 'odds dickens, then, you mun mind your P's and Q's, lad, for
                  she ha' money. But did she speak to thee?'
               "'Ees,' replied Humphrey, 'to be sure she did, and zaid I wur a likely lad, loike,
                  he, he, he!'
               "'And what answer did'st ye mak', lad?'
               "'Why, I—I laft; he, he, he!'
               "'But you should ha' made loove to her.'
               "'But I doan't know how, feyther; what be I to zay?'
               "'Why,' I replied, 'I'll tell 'ee; but you must be partic'lar, and remember what I
                  say. When you see Sally again, you mun put on your best clo'es, an' your best
                  looks,—fall on your knees, and putting your hand upon your left
                  breast—for that be where th' heart be, you know—thus address her:—
               "'Oh, thou most in-com-parybel o' thy sex, thy eyes, like diamonds bright, have
                  pierced my heart's core—thy cheeks are carnation red— thy lips like rubies—thy
                  skin is alabaster: these, and thy graceful mien, have scorched and burnt up all
                  the particles of my heart! To thee, I come, dear Sally, to pay my devoirs; deign,
                  then, to dispense thy passion on me alone, thy faithful swain, who is this moment
                  ready to espouse thee, thou most irresistible and adorable woman.'"
               "Ah!" I observed, "an admirable speech—an eloquent speech sufficient to make an
                  impression upon the heart of a Hottentot Venus And how did Humphrey acquit
                  himself?"
               "Whoy, I'll tell 'ee, zur," replied the worthy farmer. "Yer zee, zur, Humphrey be
                  a 'cute lad, like mysen, and he do know how many beans mak' five; but
                  then he be no scholard, d'ye zee, and so he had a job to study th' hard words, so
                  as to giv' the speech wi' effect, d'ye see? So I used to mak' un say it arter I,
                  half-a-dozen times a-day, on his knees;—and then he did use to rehearse it at
                  neet, gwain to bed, 'stead o' sayin' his prayers, God forgi'e 'un. And so, at
                  last, zur, when he thought he'd a gotten it all by heart loike, away he went to
                  Squire's house to see Sally, and try his fortin';—but, dang it, zur, would 'ee
                  believe it?—if he didn't mak' a blunder on it, arter all."
               "Indeed, how wats that?"
               "Why, I'll tell 'ee, zur;—when he seed Sally Grundy, he dropped on both his
                  knees,—la'ft, grinn'd, scratch'd his head, placed his hand on his
                     right breast, an' thus began:—
               
                  
               
               "'O Sally Grundy! feyther ha' sent I here to dress ye; oh, thou most
                     unbearable of thy sex!—thy eyes, like damsoms, have
                  pierced my heart sore, thy cheeks are dangnation red,
                  thy lips like a booby's, thy skin all a plaister,—these,
                  so disgraceful and mean, have scorched and burnt up all the articles
                  of my heart. To thee I come, dear Sally, to pay my devours; feign,
                  then, to incense thy passion on me alone, thy hateful
                     swine, who is this moment ready to expose thee, thou most
                     detestable and deplorable woman!"
               "And I suppose this rather powerful speech made some impression on the gentle fair
                  one?" said I, with a smile.
               "You may well say that, zur," replied the farmer; "I b'lieve it did mak' a
                     depression on the lass, for no sooner had poor Humphrey delivered
                  it, than, instead o' fallin' into his arms, she made 'un tuk' to his
                  heels, like mad, for she seiz'd a warming-pan which wur handy, and banged him wi'
                  it out o' the house?"
               This was Humphrey Ploughshare's first and last courtship!
            
            
               "WHERE THE LION ROARETH AND THE WANG-DOODLE MOURNETH."
               MY BELOVED BRETHERING: I am a unlarnt Hard-shell Baptist preacher, of whom you've
                  no doubt hearn afore, and I now appear here to expound the scripters and pint out
                  the narrow way which leads from a vain world to the streets of Jaroosalem; and my
                  tex which I shall choose for the occasion is in the leds of the Bible, somewhar
                  between the Second Chronik-ills and the last chapter of Timothytitus; and when you
                  find it, you'll find it in these words: "And they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto
                  the mountains of Hepsidam, where the lion roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth for
                  his first born."
               Now, my brethering, as I have before told you, I am an oneddicated man, and know
                  nothing about grammar talk and collidge highfalutin, but I am a plane unlarnt
                  preacher of the Gospil, what's been foreordaned and called to prepare a pervarse
                  generashun for the day of wrath—ah! "For they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto the
                  mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth for his
                  first born"—ah!
               My beloved brethering, the tex says they shall gnaw a file. It does not say they
                     may, but shall. Now, there is more than one kind of file. There's
                  the hand-saw file, the rat-tail file, the single file, the double file, and
                  profile; but the kind spoken of here isn't one of them kind nayther, bekaws it's a
                  figger of speech, and means going it alone and getting ukered "for they shall gnaw
                  a file, and flee unto the mountains of Hepsidam sidam, whar the lion roareth and
                  the wang-doodle mourneth for its first-born—ah!"
               And now there be some here with fine close on thar backs, brass rings on thar
                  fingers, and lard on thar har, what goes it while they're yung; and thar be others
                  here what, as long as thar constitooshins and forty-cent whiskey last, goes it
                  blind. Thar be sisters here what, when they gets sixteen years old, cut thar
                  tiller-ropes and goes it with a rush. But I say, my dear brethering, take care you
                  don't find, when Gabriel blows his last trump, your hands played out, and you've
                  got ukered—ah! "For they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto the mountains of
                  Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth for his
                  first-born."
               Now, my brethering, "they shall flee unto the mountains of Hepsidam;" but thar's
                  more dams than Hepsidam. Thar's Rotter-dam, Had-dam, Amster-dam, and
                  "Don't-care-a-dam"—the last of which, my brethering, is the worst of all, and
                  reminds me of a sirkumstans I onst knowed in the state of Illenoy. There was a man
                  what built him a mill on the north fork of Ager Crick, and it was a good mill and
                  ground a  sight of grain; but the man what built it was a miserable
                  sinner, and never give anything to the church; and, my dear brethering, one night
                  there came a dreadful storm of wind and rain, and the mountains of the great deep
                  was broke up, and the waters rushed down and swept that man's mill-dam to kingdom cum, and when he
                  woke up he found that he wasn't worth a dam—ah! "For they shall gnaw a file, and
                  flee unto the mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle
                  mourneth for his first-born—ah!"
               I hope I don't hear anybody larfin; do I?
               Now, "whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth for his first-born"—ah!
                  This part of my tex, my beseaching brethering, is not to be taken as it says. It
                  don't mean the howling wilderness, whar John the Hard-shell Baptist fed on locusts
                  and wild asses, but it means, my brethering, the city of New Y'Orleans, the mother
                  of harlots and hard lots, whar corn is wuth six bits a bushel one day and nary a
                  red the nex; whar niggers are as thick as black bugs in spiled bacon ham, and
                  gamblers, thieves, and pickpockets goes skiting about the streets like weasels in
                  a barn-yard; whar honest men are scarcer than hen's teeth; and whar a strange
                  woman once took in your beluved teacher, and bamboozled him out of two hundred and
                  twenty-seven dollars in the twinkling of a sheep's-tail; but she
                     can't do it again! Hallelujah—ah! "For they shall gnaw a file, and
                  flee unto the mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle
                  mourneth for his first-born—ah!"
               My brethering, I am the captain of that flat-boat you see tied up thar, and have
                  got aboard of her flour, bacon, taters, and as good Monongahela whiskey as ever
                  was drunk, and am mighty apt to get a big price for them all; but what, my dear
                  brethering, would it all be wuth if I hadn't got religion? Thar's nothing like
                  religion, my brethering: it's better nor silver or gold gimcracks; and you can no
                  more get to heaven without it, than a jay-bird can fly without a tail—ah! Thank
                  the Lord! I'm an oneddicated man, my brethering; but I've sarched the Scripters
                  from Dan to Beersheba, and found Zion right side up, and hard-shell religion the
                  best kind of religion—ah! 'Tis not like the Methodists, what specks to get to
                  heaven by hollerin' hell-fire; nor like the Univarsalists, that get on the broad
                  gage and goes the hull hog—ah; nor like the Yewnited Brethering, that takes each
                  other by the slack of thar breeches and hists themselves in; nor like the
                  Katherliks, that buys threw tickets from their priests; but it may be likened unto
                  a man what has to cross the river—ah!—and the ferry-boat was gone; so he tucked up
                  his breeches and waded acrost—ah! "For they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto the
                  mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth for his
                  first-born!"
               Pass the hat, Brother Flint, and let every Hard-shell Baptist shell out.

               CLEANLINESS NEXT TO GOODLINESS.
               
                  
               
               NOTHING could exceed the prettiness of the suburban cottage to which Mark Pringle
                  took home his newly-married wife, except (and such a comparison is indeed odious)
                  the prettiness of the lady herself. What a picture she was! with her dark
                  sparkling eyes, sharp, clear, regular features, and "wee bit mou'," fresh as a
                  rosebud, but thin as its leaf, and her skin so silken in texture, and lucid in
                  complexion. Oh! those Yankee women! What a debt of amiability they owe nature for
                  her favoritism—then her neatness was exquisite—such hair-breadth nicety—such
                  unrumpled placitude in cuffs and collars—always looking, as the vulgar say (the
                  term is a very apt one), as if she was in print. How she managed I know not, for
                  she was by no means one of those persons who sit in a room, like waxed ladies in a
                  glass-case case, merely to be looked at; on the contrary, she was a very active,
                  bustling little person (even in her father's house); but, exert herself as she
                  would, no soil was ever contracted—no crease incurred—she was still perfect—still
                  in print; every fold falling just as it should do, every plait
                  precise, as if laid so, with the fixture that kept unmoved the glossy bands of her
                  hair.
               Everybody has seen Mark Pringle's place, or its ditto, so great a likeness exists
                  in all suburban cottages—the stuccoed front, Swiss roof, Elizabethan chimneys, and
                  Gothic windows; the always-green, trimly-kept grass-plot, with its pretty
                  flower-beds, whereof the mould looks rich colored and smooth as the dust in our
                  grandmother's agate snuff-box, the park-wire-fence, the polished door, the shining
                  knocker, the glittering windows, with their exterior jalousies, and muslin relief curtains; the scrupulously pipe—clayed
                  path, with the locked gate at the end of it.
               And now fancy Mrs. Pringle "at home," the newness of wife-hood a little worn off,
                  and a natural disposition for setting to rights beginning to develop itself. Poor
                  Mark! how happy he was watching her move hither and thither, like a very
                  incarnation of order, putting in form the chaos of a month's bachelor's
                  housekeeping; how good-naturedly he stood by to see odd gloves, song-books, bits
                  of string, segars, old letters—the rogue had taken good care not a single line in
                  a feminine hand should be amongst them—thrown out from the well-filled drawers, to
                  make room for the snowy linen and delicately-scented sachets of Mrs. Pringle's
                  régime; and what a world of importance was in the arched eyebrows and compressed
                  lips of the new wife—the queen despotic in her little empire of housewifery. Order
                  certainly looks very pretty in a week old bridal cap and white peignoir, and so
                  Mark Pringle fancied; by-and-by, however, he began to think a little rest would be
                  as well—she was always setting to rights!
               
               There are some women (and Mrs. Pringle was one of them) who start in life with the
                  idea that the golden rule of domestic comfort is comprised in two words,
                  cleanliness and economy. Instead of considering them as mere appliances, they put
                  them in the place of the principal, and believe themselves exceedingly ill-used
                  when their practice is found unproductive of the expected effect. If one be neat
                  and thrifty, they say, what excuse can a man have for leaving his home and
                  neglecting his wife? Alas! will these cold characteristics, wanting the sweet and
                  simple influences of a loving and intelligent nature, satisfy the heart, or make a
                  man's home happy? I am certain not; but let Mrs. Pringle's story tell for
                  itself.
               
               It was a love match on Mark's side, one of interest on the lady's; her pretty face
                  and nette person, joined to her character for notableness, had arrayed her in his
                  eyes with all the attributes one wishes in the being he loves; and, blinded by her
                  preference (for Rose Cottage and the adjuncts) into a belief of her affection for
                  him, he conceived himself on the day of his marriage fairly started on the high
                  road to domestic happiness, "fireside enjoyments," &c. &c. On the other
                  hand, Mrs. Pringle labored under no such poetical hallucinations. She entered upon
                  her duties as if they were such only; determined,
                  however, to be faultless in the fulfilment of them—to be the most correct, most
                  economical, most cleanly—in fact, the model-wife of the neighborhood! To the
                  working out of these principles she brought a most extensive knowledge of
                  abstergents—no end of receipts for furniture-polish, and the concoction of family
                  dishes upon a system of frugality that might make Mrs. Child's young housewife
                  blush for her extravagance. Thus, with cleanliness on one side, and economy on the
                  other, she took the seat of honor at her husband's hearth. And from such
                  supporters much might be expected; but she overworked them to opposite ends from
                  those they were intended to produce.
               The wedding visits received and paid, Mrs. Pringle felt herself at liberty to
                  commence her alterations and emendations ad
                     libitum. The drawing-room (as of most importance) was attacked first;
                  and, with the physical aid of her one servant, a rapid revolution was effected.
                  Talk of rule and compass regularity, here it was developed to its utmost
                  practicableness. Mirrors were moved, pictures transposed from an artistical light
                  to the very worst, because they wanted an azimuth of her nice perception of
                  uniformity, the cozy fire-side couches decorously drawn back to the walls, the
                  scattered chairs called to order, and made to fall in side by side, with
                  regimental precision, while the ottoman force was disposed of altogether as being
                  too irregular; and, lastly, having lavished no end of drugget on the carpet, and
                  brown holland on the chairs and sofas, the curtains were bagged, the blinds drawn
                  down, and Mrs. Pringle, taking one bland view of the subdued twilight interior,
                  turned the key in the door, and withdrew it to be placed in one of those
                  undiscoverable repositories that somehow mistresses of families contrive, unknown
                  to every one else.
               Then, her out-door touches were upon the same equable principles. Plants were tied
                  up, and branches pruned, into patterns of floral propriety, and not even a
                  straggling pensée (things that are so hard to be restrained) could be found
                  peeping its iris eye over the boundary of the harebell bordering. Morning after
                  morning, with a little basket on her arm, and scissors in her carefully-gloved
                  hand, might Mrs. Pringle be seen threading the little knots of flowers,
                  decollating the drooping blossoms before they had time to die, and cutting off
                  decayed leaves as if there was no bleeding sap to follow. I have strange fancies
                  with regard to vegetable life. They have sexes and sympathies; are childless when
                  separated; instincts, too, approaching almost to intelligence; they sleep. Who
                  shall say they are not sentient? By my word, in these days of discovery, 'tis
                  worthy the attention of scientific societies! Let gardeners look to it—there may
                  be more in cutting off the head of a cabbage than has hitherto come between
                  "Heaven and their philosophy."
               "Sally," said Mr. Pringle (he had just returned by omnibus from his office in the
                  City), to the maid who ran down to unlock his own gate to him, "Sally, isn't your
                  mistress well?"
               "Law! yes, Sir," answered the girl, perfectly astonished at the question.
               "I thought," said Mr. Pringle, "from seeing the drawing-room blinds drawn, she
                  might have had a headache and laid down."
               "Oh! no, sir, only Missus was afraid of the sun's taking the damask curtains."
               "Oh!" said Mark, walking on, pondering, in all likelihood, the capabilities of the
                  sun for petty larceny, and not altogether sceptical on the point himself—though he
                  added, in an undertone, "It has a cold, uncomfortable look from the road, but a
                  wife cannot be too careful!"
               It happened that Mark Pringle had left his home on this morning at an earlier hour
                  than he had ever done since their marriage. Business required his presence some
                  distance from town, and the hours of absence had appeared really long to him; and,
                  as he crossed the threshold of his home, his heart seemed bounding in to meet his
                  wife; but Mrs. Pringle had not yet finished the adjustment of a supernumerary
                  cover for the sitting-room sofa, and, instead of going forward to meet and welcome
                  him as she had hitherto done, she continued to pin and unpin the difficult affair,
                  in a vain endeavor to make it sit like upholsterer's work; but Pringle was neither
                  an exacting, nor a very sensitive man; and, seeing her so busy, he was going to
                  take the kiss she was too engaged to give him, when she suddenly exclaimed, wholly
                  unheeding his affectionate intention, and with a look and tone of absolute
                  distress—
               "Oh! Pringle, do look at your feet-marks; you are so careless in walking, and have
                  actually come in without wiping your boots!"
               
               Mark very quietly slipped into the hall, and relieved his soles of the power of
                  making unpleasant impressions; but he made no further effort to carry off the
                  intended caress—though this circumstance proved no bar to his lady's intensity of
                  application in finishing before dinner her task of covering the sofa squabs.
               That day, for the first time, Mark Pringle analysed the dishes; and, highly
                  creditable as the investigation must have turned out for the invention and economy
                  of the contriver, it said but little for the state of the larder, and less for the
                  skill of the cook; and Pringle, who was rather curious in his cuisine in the days of his bachelorship, ventured to
                  hint that the sum allowed for housekeeping ought to afford better dinners. Mrs.
                  Pringle laid down her knife and fork, took them up again, looked earnestly at her
                  husband, and burst into tears.
               "She was sure she did the best she could with the money—she had laid none out that
                  he did not know of—nothing for herself—it was all in the house, and intended for
                  his comfort."
               And the lady pushed away her plate, sat back in her chair, her bosom heaving, her
                  brow gathered up with every evidence of marital affliction, and her little foot
                  beating the floor, with a rapidity an Edgeware turner might have envied.
               Mr. Pringle, in his turn, was greatly moved; he rose from his seat, assured her
                  that for a moment he never doubted that, but that such a continuation of stews did
                  not do for him; he thought a soup and joint, with a variation of fish and poultry,
                  could be afforded; and he seconded the amendment by wiping away these first tears
                  from the smooth cheek of his young wife with his own cambric, and pressing her
                  very reassuringly to his breast. "It was but a word—he meant not to find fault
                  with her management—it was really wonderful in one so new to all that sort of
                  thing, but his ride had made him peckish, and there was little or nothing to
                  eat."
               
                  N'importe, Mrs. Pringle felt that she had
                  conquered—she played with her pocket-handkerchief—looked down at her little
                  fingers, and up in her husband's face, and finally finished her dinner, and took
                  wine with him as usual. And though, for a day or two, the bill of fare was altered
                  it soon returned to its primal two joints a week, with certain dishes of the genus
                  "hotch-potch," but of what particular species Mark Pringle never satisfactorily
                  ascertained.
               Time wore on, and the mistress of Rose Cottage fully established her reputation as
                  the most notable person in the neighborhood. "As particular as Mrs. Pringle,"
                  became a sort of domestic by-word; and "Look how beautifully Mrs. Pringle's
                  windows are kept," or, "Just see the way in which the Pringles' path is cleaned,"
                  the daily charge of mistresses to their maids.
               But, in the meantime, poor Pringle began to grow sceptical as to the reality of
                  "Cleanliness being next to Godliness," an axiom on which Mrs. Pringle worked in
                  the most literal way imaginable. It filled the place of every other virtue, and
                  purified, in her self-loving eyes, many an actual vice. Old friends (who serve by
                  association to keep awake old affections and human sympathies) were soon banished
                  from their hearth. Who would visit where the drawing of a chair from its
                  accustomed place, or the putting down your hat or parasol on one forbidden, so
                  discomposed the hostess that she scarcely restrained herself from removing them in
                  your presence, and looked unhappy till your departure gave her an opportunity of
                  putting things straight again? Of course, hospitality was out of the question;
                  and, as for twice blessed charity, in keeping the entrance-gate
                  locked she boasted of having shut out the annoyance of beggars, and had, at the
                  same time, closed her ears to the appealings of want, and her heart from the sweet
                  exercise of benevolence.
               Her husband's comfort was as nothing to the ridiculous exactions of her
                  whitewashed and polished Penates; every appliance of enjoyment was turned into a
                  source of discontent, and that quality that can make rags decent, and the meanest
                  cot respectable, became (by being carried to the extreme) the bane of a home
                  replete with every means for domestic happiness. Upon the principle of a "place
                  for everything, and everything in its place," china and plate, &c., were
                  locked up for show, and common articles substituted for their own use.
                  Willow-pattern delf did duty for a double service of china, and the worst
                  specimens of pottery-ware for the elegant equipage of Mark's bachelor tea-table;
                  the house was sheeted from the attics to the hall, for fear of soiling or wearing
                  the carpets; the mahogany polished to such a specimen of perfection, that it
                  became too fine for use, and poor Mark dined on water-souchy, served on a deal
                  table; if he threw himself on a sofa, a look, like a pang of
                  uneasiness, spread over Mrs. Pringle's face, lest he should put the cushions out
                  of shape or disarrange the false cover; he scarcely dared approach farther than
                  the scraper in his boots, and had only the privilege of one peg in his own hall
                  where he might unobstructedly hang up his hat. As for books, it was a treason to
                  disturb them. There they stood, like the artificial volumes in the hiatus of a
                  library; to all appearance books; but no one ever saw a gap in their
                  closely-marshalled array. It disturbed Mrs. Pringle for the day to see a chasm
                  between them, and whenever Mark did
                  "inwardly read," no sooner was the book out of his hand than the
                  regulating fingers of Mrs. Pringle were upon it, and, in an instant, it was
                  restored to its place.
               
               
                  
               
               "A wife cannot be too careful," Mark would whisper to himself, as the only solace
                  under this "iron rule," but even this comforting belief by degrees wore itself
                  out, and he felt that the extreme of carefulness for a man's property frequently
                  involves carelessness for himself.
               Poor Mrs. Pringle! if ever the elements of housewifery were embodied in human
                  form, it was in thine! Nothing else seemed to have any interest for her—she went
                  to bed tired of the doings of to-day, to dream of the doings of to-morrow; and
                  yet, you would fancy, that, like the Belides, her task was a hopeless and a
                  never-ending one; for I need not tell my readers, that a disposition for setting
                  to rights is not contented with one great radical change, and an after-continuance
                  of its principles. No, no! every morrow brought its alterations and improvements:
                  there was a genius of ambition even in the housemaid's pail; and, having set the
                  example, Mrs. Pringle knew it required continual exertion to keep in advance; but,
                  as unremitting attention (whatever be its object) is always rewarded with success,
                  Mrs. Pringle soon distanced all competitors, and was left without a single rival;
                  but something more than notableness is necessary in woman to give her that place
                  in an intelligent man's estimation that shall make her, in every sense of the
                  term, a help meet for him. And Mark, no longer under the thraldom of passion,
                  began to wonder at his own want of discernment in the choice he had made. Your
                  martinets in ultra-cleanliness have seldom much of the dove in their disposition,
                  and have much the same idea in scolding their maids that sea-captains entertain in
                  swearing at their seamen, viz., "duty is not to be done without it;" and,
                  therefore, Mark had frequently to listen to the rehearsal of the day's
                  grievances—Sally's pert answers and provoking ways, how she was found rubbing the
                  table the wrong way of the grain, and had used the plate-leather for the
                  fire-irons. Poor man! What could he do in such business? His common-places were
                  soon worn threadbare by frequent using, and his wife pronounced him the most
                  apathetic and indifferent person, because, in the midst of these diurnal details,
                  he frequently fell asleep.
               They had children, specimens of needlework and neatness, looking for ever like the
                  wax models in a baby-linen warehouse, the wonder and admiration of all the mothers
                  in the vicinity. Poor Mark! he fancied that in them he should have something on
                  which to lavish the fondness of his nature, unchecked by the fear of disarranging
                  the cheveux, or coming in collision with
                  clear-starched collars, "but 'he was such a bear!' he hugged the little things so
                  close that their lace borders were crumpled, and their long robes, or short frocks
                  (as the case might be), rendered altogether unfit to be seen; besides, he made
                  them so wild and noisy, she really wished he would not give her more trouble than
                  was necessary with them."
               So Mark grew later in coming home of an evening; his quiet good temper became
                  irascible and peevish; and frequent altercations widened (as a matter of course)
                  the breach in their domestic comfort; the lady upbraiding her husband with change,
                  and he retaliating that she had but herself to blame, having, by her extravagant
                  notions of cleanliness, made his comfortable home a purgatory to him, and
                  everything in it a source of fault-finding. And when she, upon this, grew pathetic
                  and hysterical, assuring him of her never-ending exertions to make his house the "observed of all observers," the
                  envy of husbands with untidy wives, and compared her self-imposed continuousness
                  of action to the unrest of a galley-slave, a horse in a wheel, a toad under a
                  harrow, and several other touching assimilations of enduring exertion, Mark
                  Pringle put on his hat, consigning cleanliness to dark places, and her ideas of
                  comfort to the—(we may not write it), and then sought, in the parlor of an inn,
                  the enjoyments denied him in his own.
               Years passed away. Mrs. Pringle's eyes were bright as ever, but her cheeks were
                  thinned, and the lines upon her brow repeated till they had become indelible. She
                  had tasted real vexations, had grown intimate with many bitter cares; and these
                  things always exercise one of two effects—they either humanize or harden the
                  heart. She thought of Mark's abounding love for her (a tithe of which she had not
                  deserved) in the early days of their marriage, of his long endurance of her
                  wilfulness, and even violence; she looked around (to do justice to her system) at
                  the well preserved comforts, aye, even luxuries, with which her rooms were filled;
                  she thought of her husband's respectability, of his naturally kind disposition,
                  his irreproachable character, slowly falling away into negligence, moroseness,
                  and, alas! it was to be feared, dissipation, and she felt how utterly worthless of
                  such a sacrifice had been the imbecile vanity that had induced it.
               Self-reproach, in reviewing the blessings we have lost, wears magnifying-glasses;
                  and poor Mrs. Pringle at once saw that she had trifled away happiness for a
                  profitless pre-eminence, a comfortless distinction, affecting rather her
                  qualifications for an upper housemaid than her duties as a wife and mother; and
                  here a pang (if possible more sharp than those occasioned by her husband's
                  frequent absences) pierced her heart as she recalled to herself how, in the midst
                  of their pleasant play, the sound of her coming footsteps fell like the
                  fore-shadowing of some dreaded thing, stilling the laughing voices of her children
                  into timid whispers, and throwing an invisible chain over their free steps and
                  graceful motions! Alas! could it be otherwise. When a thread dropped on the
                  carpet, the print of a warm little finger on the shining tables, a soiled frock,
                  an accidental foot-tread on the flower-beds, or a bud broken in their play, was
                  visited with such outpourings of wrath as only real vice should have elicited!
               Poor children! in their mother's presence they moved in fear and
                  trembling, and escaped from it with rejoicing, to seek, in the indulgence of
                  servants, and the privilege of their apartments, that freedom that the young of
                  all created things delight in. Something must be wrong! Mark was scarcely an
                  evening at home. She had no friends to comfort her, not even her children's
                  affection to fall back upon, and the neatness of their dress, the order of her
                  flower-garden, the unapproachable precision of her household arrangements (those
                  three feathers "par excellence" wherewith she had hitherto plumed her cap of
                  self-approval) began to have a weight and weariness in them, and the vacuum in her
                  woman's heart to yearn for something more than the fame of notableness,—in fact,
                  to want the approbation of her own family, and affection where now she awakened
                  fear; and hard as was the task, where the subduing was all on her own side, Mrs.
                  Pringle at length achieved it. The desolation of a heart, in its own
                     home, is a fearful thing, and has but one real resource—a resource
                  that involuntarily it turns to—the secret tears of affliction have in them the
                  aspirations of a wounded spirit, and when were these unheard? She began to see
                  clearly her path of duty—to feel that with her it rested to make home the nucleus
                  of her family's happiness or discomfort; and silently her work of reform began;
                  her system of cleanliness was unaltered, but it began to sit like the frill of
                  cheerfulness, instead of the stiff collar of particularity; she insensibly drew
                  close to her the hearts of her children, and unobtrusively recalled her husband's
                  affection; her pretty face, worn by petty annoyances, and latterly (as we have
                  seen) by some real cares, once more regained its loveliness, with the improvement
                  of amiable expression; and there is not now a happier couple than Mark Pringle and
                  his wife—her only regret, the lost years of pattern housekeeping.
               Some may probably fancy Mrs. Pringle a pen-and-ink caricature, but the character
                  is a real one, and not even drawn at full length. I knew her in both phases of it,
                  as the "particular Mrs. Pringle;" and—after the abjuration of her false creed,
                  "Cleanliness next to Godliness"—as one of the most agreeable, kind-hearted persons
                  imaginable; and from herself did I have these confessions.
               
                  
               
            
            
               
               THE QUIET STREET.
               
                  
                     THERE is enjoyment in the pathless woods,
                     The silent valleys yield a tranquil treat.
                     Thus thought I, as I moved with all my goods,
                     To an apartment in a quiet street.
                  
                  
                     No thoroughfare allured the busy throng,
                     One end was finish'd off with railings neat,
                     No public vehicles would pass along,
                     It form'd a cul-de-sac—this
                        quiet street.
                  
                  
                     I took possession of the second floor,
                     A two-pair front, not elegant but neat:
                     What could a peaceful poet wish for more
                     Than humble lodgings in a quiet street?
                  
                  
                     I woo'd the muse one sunny afternoon,
                     I'd pen and ink and everything complete,
                     Prepared to write a sonnet to the Moon—
                     Fancy grows vigorous in a quiet street.
                  
                  
                     "Hail, Luna!"—But what is that? a distant sound
                     Appears my auditory sense to greet;
                     It cannot be. "Hail, Luna!"—I'll be bound
                     An organ 's got into this quiet street.
                  
                  
                     No matter,—'twill be over very soon;
                     There's a policeman somewhere on the beat.
                     Hark!—there's a trumpet, sadly out of tune,
                     Waking the echoes of this quiet street.
                  
                  
                     "Partant pour la Syrie," the organ plays;
                     And now a voice more powerful than sweet,
                     Hoarsely invokes the "Light of other Days"—
                     A ballad-singer 's got into the street.
                  
                  
                     The band begins a Polka—sounds increase—
                     "Sekund edishun,"—"Rooshians in retreat."
                     "Hail, Luna"—no, not that—hi-there, police,
                     Is this permitted in a quiet street?
                  
                  
                     Silence your brazen throats, you green-baize band;
                     Avaunt, you trafficker in feline meat;
                     You organ-grinder, hold your impious hand,
                     Nor dare to desecrate this quiet street.
                  
                  
                     "Hail, Luna!"—"Muffins!"—"Goddess of the night!"
                     "Cat's meat!"—"Thou silver orb!"—Let me retreat,
                     Another line I'll not attempt to write:
                     This very day I'll leave this quiet street.
                  
                  
                     
                  
               
               
                  [EDWIN is a young bard, who has taken a lodging in a Quiet Street, that he
                     may write his prize poem. The interlocutors are demons of both sexes.
                  
                     EDWIN
                     (composing).
                     Where the bright fountain sparkling never ceases
                     Its gush of limpid music,
                  
                  
                     FEMALE DEMON.
                     "Wa-ter-creee-ses!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     Where splashing on the marble floor it tinkles
                     Its silver cadence,
                  
                  
                  
                     MALE DEMON.
                     "Buy my periwinkles!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                      Where the sad Oread oft retires to weep
                     Her long lost love, her unforgiving
                  
                  
                     BLACK DEMON.
                     "Sweep!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     And tears that comfort not must ever flow
                     At thought of every joy departed,
                  
                  
                     DEMON FROM PALESTINE.
                     "Clo."
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     There let me linger, stretched beneath the trees,
                     Tracing in air fantastic
                  
                  
                     ITALIAN DEMON.
                     "Imagees."
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     And weave long grasses into lovers' knots.
                     And wish the spell had power to silence
                  
                  
                     DEMON IN APRON.
                     "Pots!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     What varied dreams the vagrant fancy hatches,
                     A playful Leda with her Jove-born
                  
                  
                     RAGGED OLD DEMON.
                     "Matches!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     She opes her treasure-cells, like Portia's caskets,
                     And bids me choose her
                  
                  
                     DEMON WITH CART.
                     "Baskets, any baskets!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     Spangles the air with thousand colored silks,
                     That float like clouds in dying sunset
                  
                  
                     OLD DEMON.
                     "Whilks!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     Garments which the fairies might make habits,
                     When Oberon holds his court and
                  
                  
                     LAME DEMON.
                     "Ostend rabbits!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     Visions like those the Interpreter, of Bunyan's,
                     Displayed to Mercy, and young Matthew.
                  
                  
                     DEMON WITH A STICK.
                     "Onions!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     And prompted glowing utterances, to their's kin,
                     Who sang, when Earth was younger
                  
                  
                     DIRTY DEMON.
                     "Hareskin! hareskin!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     In thoughts so bright the aching sense they blind,
                     In their own lustrous languor.
                  
                  
                     DEMON WITH WHEEL.
                     "Knives to grind!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     Though gone, the Deities that long ago
                     Haunted Arcadia's perfumed meads
                  
                  
                     GRIM DEMON.
                     "Dust, Ho!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     Though from her radiant brow no Iris settles,
                     Like some bright butterfly to
                  
                  
                     SWARTHY DEMON.
                     "Mend your kettles!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     Though sad and silent is the ancient seat,
                     Where Olympians raised their proud
                  
                  
                     DEMON WITH SKEWERS.
                     "Cat's me-e-et!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     There is a spell that none can chase away,
                     From scenes once visited by
                  
                  
                     DEMON WITH ORGAN.
                     "Poor Dog Tray!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     There is a charm whose power must ever blend
                     The past and present in its
                  
                  
                     DEMON WITH RUSHES.
                     "Chairs to mend!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     And still unbanished falters on the ear
                  
                  
                     DEMON WITH CAN.
                     "Any beer!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     Still Pan and Syrinx wander through the groves.
                     Still Zephyr moves
                  
                  
                     SHE DEMON.
                     "Shavings for your Stoves"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     The spot God visited is sacred ground,
                     And echo answers
                  
                  
                     SECOND DEMON WITH ORGAN.
                     "Bobbing all around."
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     Ay, and for ever, while this planet rolls
                     To its sphere-music
                  
                  
                     DEMON WITH FISH.
                     "Mackerel or Soles!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     While crushed Enceladus in torment groans
                     Beneath his Etna shrieking
                  
                  
                     LITTLE DEMON.
                     "Stones, hearthstones!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     While laves the tideless sea the glittering strand
                     Of Grecia
                  
                  
                     THIRD DEMON WITH ORGAN.
                     "'Tis hard to give the hand!"
                  
                  
                     EDWIN.
                     While as the cygnet nobly walks the water,
                     So moves on earth the fair
                  
                  
                     FOURTH DEMON WITH ORGAN.
                     "Ratcatcher's Daughter!"

               THE FAIRY OAK.
               AN IRISH LEGEND.
               
                  
                  CLOTH removed, dessert duly arranged, and——
               
               "By no means," replied our self-constituted host, "Mr. Sullivan has already
                  assured us of your powers of narration; therefore, perhaps you will be good enough
                  to open the entertainment."
               "With all my heart. But what shall it be about?"
               "Oh! something about Ireland. I love to hear stories of that delightful country,"
                  cried a young Parisian lady; "I have a cousin who resided there for several years,
                  and he assures me it is filled with fairies, and ghosts, and giants, and——"
               "Well, I must admit," said Mr. Sullivan, "that we have strange people and things
                  in that country; and as to the existence of fairies, there can be no denying the
                  fact."
               The midshipman began tittering.
               "Aye, you may laugh, young sir. But if you lived in Ireland you would not be quite
                  so sceptical. The fairies, or good people—providence preserve me from interfering
                  with them—are indeed powerful, as Terence, alas, can tell you."
               "The deuce a truer word you ever said," cried the Squire.
               "Why, what can they have to do with you?" asked the old Indian.
               "Sure, haven't you observed I was lame? and so indeed are both my brothers; one
                  has a hump upon his back, and the other's all crooked sided."
               "But what can this have to do with fairies?"
               "Tell them, Terence dear, tell them how you became lame, and let it stand in place
                  of a better story."
               "I will that same, so here goes:
               "You must know, my dear friends, that my brothers and myself were born, with
                  straight forms and athletic limbs, and were, I have every reason to believe, the
                  pride of our parents and the admiration of the peasantry, who, in the south of
                  Ireland, take as much interest in the 'children of the master' as in their own.
                  And, as my father, commonly styled Sullivan, of Ballyleague Castle, in the county
                  of Clare, was universally beloved—not only was our infant beauty widely, but our
                  subsequent misfortune generally known throughout all Munster. You must know, too,
                  that my father, in his younger days, served in the cavalry, and consequently, was
                  little in Ireland; indeed, like many more of our countrymen, he affected to
                  despise its rusticity, and joined in the favorite observation of many, who, on
                  beholding anything very awkward or ridiculous, are apt to exclaim, 'How very
                  Irish!' Well, gentlemen, you may naturally suppose, that with these ideas he was
                  delighted to marry an English woman—the daughter of a Devonshire baronet—who
                  professed a perfect horror of the Green Isle, and naively believed that the lower
                  orders were caught in a wild state, and required considerable tuition before they
                  could be broken into civilized life. These fancies greatly delighted my father,
                  and he felt justly proud of his dear English wife's prejudices. Except as a matter
                  of jest, the name of Ireland was never mentioned—nor its green acres ever thought
                  of, save as a colonial possession, whence the revenues of the happy pair were to
                  be drawn; thus for the first six months of their marriage, the idea of visiting
                  their Irish estates was unthought of by either of my parents. At the end of that
                  period, it was one morning announced to my father, that his bride was in that
                  happy state in which those joy to be 'who love their lords.' From this moment his
                  views seemed changed. Ireland rose up in his mind's eye—not only as the cherished
                  scene of his youth, but as the necessary cradle of his future heir; and after much
                  consultation—after considerable remonstrance on the part of his lady wife—she was
                  at length forced to yield the point. It was determined that the blood of our
                  ancestors required the future heir of the old house to be first introduced into
                  the world on his own lands, and amidst his own vassals.
               "My father was an energetic and determined man; so, in one month more, blazing
                  tar-barrels proclaimed through our estate, that the welcome master had
                  returned.
               "But if the arrival of their long absent lord filled the breasts of his tenantry
                  with joy, how shall I describe their enthusiasm when they beheld him accompanied
                  by one of the fairest creatures in creation, and learnt from his own mouth that
                  she was about to give birth to an heir—a ra'al Sullivan—one of the old stock—to be
                  born and bred in the old castle—in the old chamber—where their hereditary lords
                  had been ushered into the world for the last three hundred years. Faith,
                  gentlemen, an Irish landlord can alone conceive the sympathetic joy of an Irish
                  peasant on such an occasion.
               "The warm 'Cead mille failthea' of her people
                  failed, however, in melting the strongly prejudiced heart of my excellent mother,
                  who still refused to believe that our
                  countrymen were a single degree more civilized than the Red Indians of America, or
                  the wild inhabitants of Timbuctoo. She consequently became melancholy and
                  reserved, and loved to show her superior mind by checking what she conceived to be
                  the absurd superstitions 'of a savage nation.'
               "If you have resided any time in Ireland, it will scarcely be necessary to tell
                  you that there is always one favored female retainer (generally the foster mother
                  of her husband) who attaches herself to the lady of the estate, and that this
                  personage looks upon herself as privileged—more particularly in the matter of
                  gossip. Now, in our family, old Norah O'Donnell filled this envied post, and
                  failed not to recount with pride all the strange legends which she thought would
                  please her mistress, as we as all the little gossipings and goings on, which might
                  serve to cheer her somewhat sinking spirits.
               
                   "Her tales of banshees, spirits, and fairies my revered parent treated
                  with the utmost scorn, 
                     and often and often
                     and often
                   would old Norah stop her ears, as my mother boldly defied their power.
                  But when she desired an old riven oak to be cut down—an oak in which the good
                  people (fairies) loved to assemble—because it impeded some favorite view, the poor
                  old woman almost went mad, and she vainly implored her mistress, as she valued her
                  peace, to spare a tree whose destruction would enrage every Luprechan in the
                  country. Besides, there was an old saying, a sort of prophecy about it. What its
                  meaning was, Norah could not pretend to say, but it ran thus:— 
                     
                        'All three
                        Shall pay for the tree.'
                     
                   and if this haunt of the good people was destroyed, there was no saying what
                  might be the consequences.
               "These seemingly foolish remonstrances only made my mother more obstinate—more
                  determined to show her contempt for the ridiculous belief in spirits so prevalent
                  in Ireland, so, as my father was away, in spite of every entreaty, the fairy Oak
                  was cut drown.
               The next morning, news was brought that my father had broken his arm in Dublin.
                  This was looked upon as a just punishment on the obstinate Englishwoman. In the
                  evening there was a grave consultation amongst the servants, respecting the
                  meaning of the old legend— 
                     
                        'All three
                        Shall pay for the tree.'
                     
                   Alas! their forebodings told them something dreadful was sure to happen.
               "About this time several of the cattle died, and the oldest woman in the parish
                  declared that the good people had in many instances shown their grief and anger at
                  the loss of their favorite resort, but in all else things went on as smoothly as
                  ever; and when the lady of the castle was safely delivered of a fine,
                  well-proportioned, bouncing boy (you may stare, but I was so), the superstitious
                  retainers were fain to confess, that their fears were happily unfounded, and that
                  the fairies, for once, had withheld their revenge.
               "My mother was now most anxious to return to England, but pecuniary means, I
                  believe, induced my father to oppose her desire, and they agreed, though sorely
                  against the will of the former, to remain three years longer in Ireland, at the
                  expiration of which time she was to return again to her native isle, with a solemn
                  assurance that she should be no more asked to visit this land of poverty and
                  superstition.
               "I will not detain you by telling you how my parent passed these dull years of her
                  existence. Suffice it to say she became the mother of two more boys, and in the pride of maternity (for
                  we were indeed a beautiful group to look upon) she became more reconciled to poor
                  Ireland. Norah, however, always shook her head and looked solemn, to the great
                  amusement of her mistress, who laughed at her fears and defied the resentment of
                  the 'good people.'
               "My brothers and myself all slept together in a very large old crimson curtained
                  bed, the same bed in which the heirs to our house had been born for several
                  centuries back—the same bed which I'll show you whenever you'll do me the honor of
                  visiting Ballyleague Castle.
               "Well, my friends, this bed is not only ample in its size as a bed of rest, but is
                  remarkably high, so high that the four pillars which support the draperies reach
                  within a single inch of the ceiling; the consequence is, that a man can with
                  difficulty insert his hand between the top of the bed and the ceiling of the
                  room.
               "One night, it appears, we were all put to rest in high spirits and health, and
                  nursed to sleep by the Irish snatches which Norah loved to sing. Her charges thus
                  disposed of, the worthy nurse went down, as was her usual wont, to have a gossip
                  in the servants' hall, entirely forgetting (as she has since assured me) that this
                  was the third anniversary of the destruction of the Fairy Oak.
               "In about an hour or perhaps a little more, old Norah again returned up-stairs to
                  renew her vigil beside our couch—but who shall paint her terror, her dismay, on
                  finding that couch deserted. For a moment she looked about, but seeing no traces
                  of the children she had left, she made up her mind that the 'English lady,' as my
                  mother was always called, had stolen away the children in order to punish her
                  truancy and prove her carelessness to my father on his return.
               "Full of this idea she rushed to my mother's room, but her worst fears were only
                  met with equal alarm, and, accompanied by my distracted parent, she re-entered the
                  nursery, to commence a vain search which lasted for several hours, but without the
                  slightest result—the whole house was ransacked, the park was searched, rewards
                  were offered, threats held out, but still the children could not be found.
               "Unable to stray, from our extreme youth, it was evident we had been abducted. My
                  poor mother, half mad with anxiety, tore her hair, and vowed it was done by some
                  expectant heir or some savage retainer; Norah rocked herself to and fro in the
                  corner, waving her hands up and down; she continued to utter prayers for our
                  safety, and curses on our abductor. At length, however, as if struck by some
                  sudden thought, her whole manner changed in an instant, and crying out loudly 'it
                  is he good people,' rushed out to the spot where their oak once stood.
               "Here those that followed her perceived that the grass had lately been much
                  disturbed, and several wild flowers lay about as if recently plucked from their
                  parent stem; little patches here and there showed the print of the most tiny
                  footsteps, and Norah to this hour swears she heard the fairies laughing and
                  singing in some of the bushes which grew around, as if in mockery of her anguish.
                  No traces, however, of the missing children could be found, and the miserable
                  group returned to the Castle.
               "It was fully one o'clock in the morning when my mother threw herself distractedly
                  on the bed so lately occupied by her loved treasures, and her self-reproached
                  nurse cast herself beside it to weep in expiation of her culpable neglect.
               "An hour had thus passed, when the avenue bell announced the return of my father.
                  What agony did this sound not bring to the bosom of his wife—how could she meet
                  him with such a tale? How should she reveal to a fond and doating parent, that all
                  his hopes were blighted—his children all swept away at one fell swoop? Death
                  indeed at that moment would have been a welcome guest both to the mistress and the
                  maid.
               "At this instant of agony, when my poor mother, trembling, listened for my
                  father's approaching footstep, a low sound broke upon her ear, and with a scream
                  of mingled anguish and delight, she recognised the plaintive cry of one of her
                  children. Norah, as frantic as herself, heard the loved tones, and with maddened
                  eagerness they both now resumed their search.
               "The wailing became louder, and they at once perceived that the sounds proceeded
                  from the top of the bed; they felt with their hands the linen tester or top—and, O
                  joy unutterable!—joy too great to bear—they distinctly traced the forms of myself
                  and brothers, and with a cry of gladness flew towards the door as my father
                  entered.
               "A few moments explained to him the whole case.
               "But now came the mystery—the problem which must for ever remain unsolved—how
                  could the babies have got there? That they had been placed there, was evident; yet
                  the bed-frame had been undisturbed, and, as I said before, the solid cornice
                  reached within one inch of the no less solid ceiling; yet such was the fact, which
                  thousands can avouch.
               "The question was now how to extricate us from our strange position—to take down
                  the bed, or cut through the superior floor, would have been a work of time. Norah
                  suggested the best means; she rushed to a work-box, and, snatching a pair of
                  scissors, divided the linen roof of the bed in the centre; we fell one by one,
                  apparently uninjured, into the fond arms of our doating, our delighted
                  parents.
               
               "But, ladies and gentlemen," added Sullivan, in a grave tone, "their joy was of
                  short duration; we were at that instant, as you now see us, cripples of various
                  forms. From that moment to the present hour the three sons of the House of
                  Sullivan have been objects of deformity. Our parents quitted this country, never
                  to return; and only five years ago poor old Norah expired, affirming, with her
                  last breath her conviction that we were thus punished by the good people for the
                  offence our mother was guilty of in cutting down 'The Fairy Oak.'"
            
            
               TAKING THE CHAIR.
               
                  
                  I THOUGHT it an important and honorable thing when, as a
                  Committee-man of the Saint Nicodemus Literary, Scientific, Botanical, Geological
                  and Carpenters' Institution, I was, for the first time, appointed to take the
                  chair during a lecture. I arrayed myself for the occasion with unusual elegance,
                  and exhibited once more to public admiration my best white satin waistcoat, my
                  favorite studs of blue turquoise (on a semi-globular base, as a mathematical
                  friend happily designated them), and a pair of unexceptionable dress boots.
                  Possibly some of my readers may remember the costume. It was that in which I made
                  so decided an impression in the part of Cassius (vide, "Quarrel scene" Julius Cæsar—Shakespere) on the occasion of
                  our last Elocutionary Entertainment, for a detailed account of which see the
                     Saint Nicodemus Trumpeter, No. 1—but I need scarcely state the
                  number, as No. 2 did not come out, in consequence of a difficulty.
               My general appearance, as I surveyed myself in the glass before starting, gave me
                  intense satisfaction. Moreover, on that auspicious evening, the pretty and
                  accomplished Emmy Wright had yielded to my importunities to allow me to escort her
                  to the lecture; and I anticipated great and permanent advantages from the exalted
                  position in which she would there behold me.
               When the hour arrived, it was not without some feeling of justifiable pride that I
                  handed, with many bows and smiles, my fair charge to a conspicuous seat on the
                  platform. Then after vanishing for one  moment from the public gaze, I
                  reappeared, introducing Crapely Deadman, Esq. (a dismal-looking man in a snuffy
                  coat and green spectacles) to deliver a lecture on "WOMAN; her Influence and
                  Durties, with a Glance at her Position during the Middle Ages." On taking my seat
                  I endeavored to assume a graceful position in the chair, which I found a few sizes
                  too large for a person of my limited stature. When I reclined against the back
                  cushions, my boots hung dangling several inches (a punster would say two feet)
                  from the ground. If I placed them nicely on the floor, I could but just reach the
                  back with my occiput, which, as the scientific reader may properly be aware, is
                  situate at the hinder portion of my head. In divers experiments of this nature,
                  the first half-hour passed pleasantly enough, 
               
               After that I condescended to listen for a brief space to the lecturer, whom I soon
                  discovered to be a very tedious, not to say a very stupid man. I assented,
                  however, to his platitudes by a patronising nod whenever he finished a
                  sentence—which was not often, as he had a way of talking in parentheses, one
                  inside the other, like the celebrated
                  Chinese puzzles of hollow balls. I soon saw the audience one by one
                  effecting their retreat under cover of feeble bursts of applause, got up
                  for the purpose. I saw Biddles leave, making hideous grimaces at me, deriding my
                  inability to follow him. I saw fat Mrs. Fubbs arrange herself for a comfortable
                  nap, and Potter and Pipes pairing off (arm-in-arm) on the Malt Question. But oh!
                  worst of all! I saw my detested rival, Jack Stanley, enter in a shooting coat, and
                  occupy the vacant seat next to Emmy Wright, to whom he evidently soon made himself
                  agreeable by sarcastic reflections on the lecturer and on myself. Meanwhile, in my
                  lonely chair I felt as isolated as Robinson Crusoe, and as conscious yet
                  powerless, as a disembodied spirit. But none of this was remarked by the lecturer,
                  who, like many other equally profound philosophers, was perfectly ignorant of all
                  that passed immediately under his nose. He continued his monotonous discourse in a
                  strain of dulness which appeared interminable.
               Ten o'clock came. But, as an abler writer than myself (I allude to Shakspere)
                  would have expressed it: "What's ten o'clock to him—or he to ten o'clock?"
               One of the camphene lamps on the table went out, and emitted noisome effluvia.
                  Next, out went the other. Deadman, Esq., cared no more for their extinction than
                  he did for that of the tribe of Megalosauri, respecting which exciting historical
                  incident Doddle Winksby, Esq., delivered such an admirable lecture, last Thursday
                  fortnight.
               A boy in the gallery dropped his cap into the pit. Some one from below walked out
                  with it to restore it; and a committee man, apparently in a furious passion,
                  rushed out as if to castigate the boy for the interruption; he boy went down the
                  stairs to recover his cap—and not one of the three ever returned.
               Mrs. Fubbs was at this time a conspicuous object from the platform, having fallen
                  asleep with her forehead across the back of the seat in front of her. She was
                  performing a bass accompaniment to the lecture by a series of awful nasal sounds
                  which it would have been base flattery to call mere snoring.
               A few minutes more, and I saw  the fascinating Emmy rise to depart,
                  followed by Stanley, who tendered his arm, which was accepted. Ye Gods! Yet there
                  I sat, as the poet has beautifully expressed it, "like patience on," &c.
                  (Shakspere.)
               The lecture terminated shortly after eleven. I rushed from the building ("Adieu,
                  thou dreary pile!") in a frame of mind in which I might have furnished a picture
                  of despair; and-next discovered that it was raining, in torrents, that I had no
                  umbrella, and that my fair false friend and her companion had taken advantage of
                  the cab I had ordered at ten precisely. I hurried under a neighboring archway, and
                  there occupied myself some minutes with bitter reflections upon the lecturer's
                  dulness, and my own stupidity in taking the chair. Here I discovered that my
                  waistcoat was spoiled by the rain, and my boots soaked through.
               As I stood there, damp, shivering, and miserable, a horrid form 
                  approached—'Twas he! All my sufferings passed at once with redoubled intensity
                  across my fevered brain, and one desperate idea thrilled my soul. I confess my
                  crime. It was base, wicked, and cruel, I know, to carry out that fearful thought.
                  But it would not be banished. A thousand demons seemed to prompt me to revenge,
                  and to hiss, in "still small voices," "You must do it—now is your time—you must
                  bonnet Crapely Deadman, Esq.!"
               I rushed forward madly. The palm of my open had descended on the crown of the hat
                  of that innocent yet dreary man, like the lightning upon the forest oak. The brim of his hat descended instantly to
                  his shoulders; while his great green spectacles, falling jingling from his nose,
                  dashed into atoms on the sloppy pavement. He struggled wildly for a second; and
                  then, clasping his hands, fell on his knees before a post, and in frantic accents
                  beseeched it to take his money and spare his life. I was cut to the heart.
               I heard him afterwards faintly shouting "Police," until his voice was lost in the
                  distance as I hurried home. But as I never heard more of my midnight adventure, I
                  presume he did not recognise, in the drenched buttoned-up figure who attacked him,
                  the once elegant Chairman for the Evening.
            
            
               MY LUCK.
               
                  I KNOW that I am celebrated! I do not blush to confess it. It's not my
                  fault—I cannot help it! I am perfectly aware that I am chronicled in story,
                  invoked in song, and immortalized in comedy. I know you have heard of me ten
                  thousand times;—but I am not to blame—"It's my luck!"
               There never lived a man who naturally and instinctively shrunk from fame with so
                  much sensitiveness as myself—yet thus I have had it thrust upon me. I can only
                  repeat—"It's my infernal luck!"
               I cannot endure this state of things any longer. I must "burst out" in regard to
                  my sufferings—there must be something done, or I shall certainly go mad.
               I'll call a public meetings—I'll appeal to the Legislature—I'll change my
                  name—I'll get a divorce from this cursed fate that follows me.
               I know I'm excited; I feel it. But, confound it! what else can you expect? Indeed
                  I need your indulgence—I want your sympathy. Sympathy? Why I never
                  met with such a thing in my life, except from one individual, and he died the next
                  day.
               But it is not sufficient that I am miserable. I am not allowed to luxuriate
                  quietly in my own wretchedness, and wrap my miseries around me, as they were
                  widow's weeds. My woes are dragged before the public: my own private sorrows are
                  made the theme of general mirth. My agonies are considered to be most laughable
                  comicalities. I have myself seen a thousand people grinning, hyena-like over the
                  wretchedness of Guy Goodluck, as portrayed by some inhuman wretch of a comedian.
                  That diabolical farce, that identical petite comedy, is the veritable transcript
                  of a few brief pages, extracted at random from the record of my life.
                     I was the victim of the machinations of that "d—d, infernal,
                  diabolical John Jones!" I am "that rash and most unfortunate man,"
                  therein styled, with facetious bitterness, Guy Goodluck.
               Sir, I have expressed a wish to draw upon your sympathy; and I wish to convince
                  you that I need and deserve it. If the narrative which I hereto append does not
                  serve as a letter of credit authorizing an unlimited draft;—if your ear, open to
                  others, should be deaf to me, I can only repeat, that—"It's my luck."
               A few years since, I commenced a tour through the States, and it is to the
                  incidents of that tour that I would ask your attention; firmly convinced, that
                  when you have perused the painful history, you will unhesitatingly accord to me
                  that distinctive appellations.—"The unfortunate man."
               
               I left New York for Charleston, South Carolina, in a vessel recommended as a
                  fast-sailer, on a Friday, in preference to waiting until the following Monday for
                  the steam-packet. This ship's voyages, for three years previous, had averaged
                  something less than five days; but I was on board,
                     my interests were involved, and the vessel was driven off the
                  coast by a tremendous gale: thus five weeks elapsed before we reached Charleston,
                  minus the mizen-mast and foretop-mast, and in a state of incipient starvation:— 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               Leaving Charleston in a week, I took the morning railroad train for Augusta,
                  Georgia. Should have been in Augusta between four and five o'clock P.M. Locomotive
                  broke down, obliging us to walk five miles in a drenching rain; and we did not
                  arrive until two the next morning. Hotels all closed; no beds, except "the soft
                  side of a plank" at the depôt.
               Next day made my way to a hotel. The weather being fine and warm they gave me a room without any fire-place,
                  and looking due north through three large windows. That afternoon an influx of
                  travellers filled the house, so that they had not a square inch of room to
                  spare—and then the weather changed! The next three were the only
                  really cold days that had visited Augusta in five years.
               Of course I took a cold that stuck by me for the next six months:— 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               Left Augusta in the stage-coach for Florida, at seven o'clock, on as fine an
                  evening as ever was seen. Before ten, there came down such a rain as had not been
                  seen since the days of the patriarch Noah; in the midst of which the coach
                  capsized in the woods, and we spent nearly the whole remainder of the night
                     al fresco, in getting again under way. Rode
                  in wet garments till breakfast time, and then, it being late, no time was allowed
                  to change them, but we were obliged to ride on undried; in a predicament, and
                  undergoing a process of evaporation, only to be appreciated by a victim of
                  Priesnitz. Pushed on all that day and another night, without any respite; came to
                  a river, (the Ogeechee,) where, for twenty years, there had been a bridge strong
                  enough to withstand all freshets; but as I wanted to cross it, it had
                  been washed away during the previous night. After some delay, we put ourselves
                  into a crazy concern of a flat-boat, and crossed, coach and all. In the course of
                  this operation my hat was knocked overboard and lost, and I was compelled to
                  perform the remainder of my journey in a night-cap. At length we reached the
                  Chatahoochie river, on the confines of Florida; a steamboat had passed half an
                  hour before our arrival, and no other expected for a week. Before the week
                  expired, the river had fallen so low as not to be navigable. 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               Took land conveyance for Pensacola in Florida; went about forty miles, and was
                  obliged to turn back by a sudden outbreak of the Indians. Circumstances, growing
                  out of this cause, increased the term of additional detention to about three
                  weeks. Reached Mobile eventually, though every ten miles of the way
                  had required from me about three hours more for their accomplishment than they
                  would from any one else. Two steam-boats left Mobile for New Orleans at the same
                  hour: I embarked on board the fastest; sure to arrive two hours
                  sooner than the other. Our engine got out of order, and the slow boat
                  beat us by half-a-day. I had a wager pending with a fellow passenger, that we
                  should beat her by an hour!
               Went to a hotel in New Orleans. Crowded—but could give me a fine
                  room; the only objection being, that the key was lost:—that, however, should be
                  replaced in the morning. Spent the evening very pleasantly; retired, for once in
                  my life, in high spirits. Awoke the next morning, minus a pair of inexpressibles
                  and all my cash— 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               Having, by some unusual conjunction of fortunate circumstances, letters of credit,
                  and not having happened to lose them, I succeeded in reclothing my
                  nether limbs and relining my pockets;—and, in a state bordering on frenzy, I
                  rushed on board a steam-boat bound up the Mississippi.
               That, boat was the ill-fated ORONOCO!
               After enduring all the horrors of the scene of death consequent upon the fearful
                  explosion on board that "ill-starred, perfidious bark," I escaped from her at
                  Vicksburgh, landed, and went to the principal hotel. That very night, "the great
                  fire" broke out, consuming the whole square on which the hotel stood. I escaped,
                  with the loss of all my baggage. Owing to exposure, fright, and fatigue, I was
                  attacked the next day with a bilious fever, which kept me a prisoner for six
                  weeks!:— 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               The fever finally "evacuated;" and salivated, scorched, and worn to a
                  skeleton—more dead than alive—I started for the Red River, in the vain hope that
                  on the extreme verge of civilization my infernal "luck" might desert me. 'Twas a
                  vain attempt! After that "jumping-off-place of all creation,"
                     Shreveport, was left behind us, (being more than six hundred miles
                  up that wild stream, the Red River,) and just as I began to indulge the fondest
                  anticipations, the boat struck a snag in "the great raft," and sunk in twenty
                  minutes.
               There being, no other steam-boat at that time up the river, we were obliged to
                  take small boats and go down, drifting, with the current by day, and sleeping on
                  shore (with the snakes, alligators, and mosquitoes) by night. Arrived, after a
                  week of this tedious voyaging, at Natchitoches, and there got on board a small
                  steam-boat, and continued our downward course. The river being at flood, the boat
                  ran into the woods and knocked down both her chimneys. They fell overboard and
                  sunk! We lay by for a day, and built wooden chimneys out of some
                  planks which were found piled on the shore. Thought them rather combustible; but
                  the captain had used similar ones frequently with 255 fect success. So we started; ran merrily for about
                  ten miles. Why not twenty or fifty? I was on board. The confounded
                  chimneys took fire and were consumed, the boat herself having a narrow escape! 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               By some means or other, I hardly know what, I reached Cincinnati, Ohio. Met there
                  an old friend; one of my few real friends. "After all my troubles and torments,"
                  thought I, "this is one happiness beyond the reach of fate:"—but he was going to
                  New Orleans the same day!—This, however, I made the best of. He had taken passage
                  in a beautiful, new boat. This was to be her first trip; and, willing to give the
                  citizens a treat, her captain invited the friends of the passengers to remain on
                  board, and he would run two or three miles up the river, and land them as he again
                  passed the pier on his way down. We remained on board. I remained.
                  The boat ran two or three miles up the stream, turned, and when nearly at the
                  wharf again a fearful explosion was heard:—the shattered fragments of the MOSELLE
                  were scattered upon the stream and shores of the Ohio.
               My woes were not to end thus. Happening to wish to be killed, such an
                  event was an impossibility. I was rescued from the water perfectly uninjured. 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               Some time elapsed. I went to Canada. I joined the "patriots." Now, thought I,
                  linked with men as desperate as myself, I may at least bring my sorrows to a
                  speedy termination. Everything worked in unison with my hopes. I was taken
                  prisoner, in arms! I was tried at London, Upper Canada, and sentenced to be
                  hanged! The day arrived; I stood upon the scaffold; the fatal noose was placed
                  around my neck; already I seemed to have advanced one step into the other world.
                  Just as I was expecting the irrevocable signal for the executioner to launch me
                  forth, a reprieve arrived from Sir George Arthur! This was followed by a free
                  pardon! My happiness in prospect of the close of my career was considered proof
                  positive of insanity. Some persons curious in monomania had obtained my
                  release!
               I was sent out of the province, of course. I took the stage for Detroit, Michigan.
                  The stage proprietors were in the habit of shortening their route some seventy
                  miles, by traversing the ice on Saint Clair. We took the same course in the
                  present instance. A strong north-west gale came on, and the ice began to break up.
                  We were obliged to make for the shore with all our speed, and eventually to
                  abandon the horses and coach, and clamber over the broken ice to the land. Two
                  fellow passengers were drowned. My perfect indifference preserved me, and I landed
                  in safety.
               I arrived at Detroit. Some prospect existing of disturbance on the frontier, I
                  enlisted in the United States' army. I wanted to be shot,—instead of
                  which I froze my toes and received a flogging for sleeping while on sentry duty. I
                  never can sleep. Not even a stage-coach or railway car. Never
                  could—always, under all circumstances, restless and wakeful. It was essential for
                  me to keep awake, and, of course, I went to sleep like a hog! I got
                     flogged—I, for sleeping!
               
               A fellow-soldier committed a contemptible piece of petty larceny. I
                  was convicted of the deed, flogged again, and drummed out of my regiment!— 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               I came again to New York. Eventually I determined to commit suicide. I bought a
                  pistol. I loaded it. I went to my room and put it to my head,—as I
                     thought! I did nothing of the sort! I missed my mark by six inches, and
                  utterly demolished a very expensive mantel-clock, an heir-loom in my landlady's
                  family. 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               It is cold,—you know it is cold,—infernally cold! Many instances have occurred of
                  people being killed by a mere plunge into the river in such weather. I rushed to
                  the wharf—I plunged into the water. "Now," exclaimed I triumphantly, "save me who
                  can!"
               A venerable watchman, who ought to have been fast asleep, (and had been so at the
                  same hour from time immemorial,) saw me,—had me picked up!
               I was floating on a cake of ice,—had been in the water for half-an-hour. I ought
                  to have been dead some minutes before I was taken out. Any other man would have
                  died twice in the same time. Never better in the whole course of my life than I
                  was the next morning. 
                     "Just my luck!"
                  
               
               
               I have been writing these painful details from an inkstand as big as a
                  half-bushel, with a base as broad as that of Mount Atlas;—never was known to
                  capsize; a twenty foot lever could not upset it, though the fate of nations
                  depended upon the accomplishment of such a result. I barely caught
                  the tip of my pen in it, and it was hurled bottom upwards upon my manuscript,
                  burying it beneath an ocean, a cataclysm of ink.
               
               My hands are covered with it! My lap is deluged! My paper, my desk, my
                  handkerchief, my carpet, are all of a hue as dark as my destiny! 
                     "Just my luck!"

               OUR LITTLE TODDLEKENS.
               
                  
                  I AM tired of books and of reading; type has no charms in my eyes;
                  many volumes are a weariness to the flesh: read, read, read, —ah, me! Old Michel
                  de Montaigne was right, when, among vows of abstinence, he also placed abstinence
                  from knowledge. "I have sometimes," says that wise man, "taken a
                  pleasure in seeing those who, from devotion, have made a vow to be
                     ignorant as well as chaste, poor and penitent; for by that vow we
                  chastise a disordered appetite, and by restraining a greediness which pricks us on
                  to continual book-reading, depriving the soul of a voluptuous conceit, which
                  flatters us under the guise of knowledge, by doing thus we richly fulfil the vow
                  of poverty, since we join to it that of humility of mind.
               Ah! true indeed, old thinker! We studious book-men rail at the man who heaps up
                  riches, and yet ourselves we strive to pile up a quantity of vain knowledge; there
                  is a greediness of learning as well as a greediness of gold. Yes, we
                  revel in intemperance, we do not give ourselves time to think; in learning also,
                  after a certain time in life, a total abstinence vow should be taken, a Maine Law,
                  a teetotal despotism might be passed and organized.
               So, good-bye books for to-night. Here is my wife looking daggers at me because I
                  will not talk to her; here is Dick wanting to show me a wonderful machine made of
                  three pieces of firewood, an old pill box, and a wheel from the bottom of a wooden
                  horse, a cotton reel, and some twine. Dick is always making those machines, of a
                  most useless and absurd character, but yet he is pleased and busy; he proposes to
                  fill the pillbox with water for some impossible project, which will end in soaking
                  his pinafore. Happy Dick, there are some machinists in the big world not yet
                  opened to you whose projections are quite as absurd.
               I turn away from Dick, however, to little Toddlekens. Little Toddlekens, is just
                  five years old. In another week, to use the phrase of my friend the groom, she
                  will be "rising six." She is bright-eyed, with a fair face, and such a white and
                  red skin as no lady in the land—not even Phillis at eighteen can boast. It
                     is a pleasure to kiss her. Being a married man, I cannot say that
                  it would be so to kiss Phillis, although some young bucks would be ready to jump
                  out of their skin to do so. I had rather kiss Toddlekens. She is so
                  pretty. Like Fielding's "Amelia," she has the prettiest nose in the world, but
                  unlike that heroine, she has not yet broken it. She has a little mouth and lips,
                  that would beat those of Phillis by an inch; clear open eyes, so deep and
                  innocent, that I sometimes look abashed before them, and a complexion which would
                  send Rowland into hysterics. Such is Toddlekens!
               She is receiving company. The latter consists of a very wooden Dutch doll, a
                  waxen-faced ditto; Mr. Noah (of the Ark), an elephant who has left his trunk
                  behind him; a papier-maché donkey, who in his youth used to wag what he has
                  lost—his head, and a miserable kitten, which has not spirit to run away. The
                  "company" sit round Toddlekens and her tea tray, and she now pours out a curious
                  mixture of weak tea, milk, and dirt. Her tea service is of wood, and the tea-pot,
                  I must confess, hath not a practicable spout, but what of that? The Dutch doll, an
                  ugly brute, with a face as flat as that of a clock, without a nose, and with no
                  hair on its head, is the favorite. Why it is so, I do not know;
                  I hate it myself. It nearly threw me down stairs once. It is not half
                  so handsome as the waxy doll, nor on the whole, so lively as Noah; nor so curious
                  as the elephant; and yet she loves it. She bows down to it, and worships it, and
                  sets it in the place of honor, gives it the best things,—it has the coffee pot
                  with a wooden spout to drink tea from—and favors it in a thousand odd ways, a
                  stupid wooden thing! Why does she do so? But, ah me! why do I and you, reader, bow
                  down to our Dutch dolls? We have some very wooden ones in the great world, and
                  give them more valuable things than toy coffee pots to play with?
               There is one thing about this young lady's method of treating her company which is
                  certainly curious. She drinks her own tea and then absorbs that of her guests;
                  none of them object to this proceeding, the kitten looks sulky certainly, and Mr.
                  Noah, who lies in a helpless state of inanity, not intoxication, looks up I fancy
                  indignantly. There, now: she has emptied the coffee pot. Hallo! now the tea pot is
                  no longer full; bless the child, she will hurt herself.
               Tea! so it is. Was ever such eagerness displayed for a meal, unless, indeed, by
                  the passengers of the wreck Medusa, or by City Aldermen for turtle. Toddlekens,
                  throned in a high chair, awaits with much anxiety for her portion of the cheering
                  draught, and the philosopher Dick, all thoughts of mechanics thrown aside,
                  occupies himself with thick bread and butter. Averse as the larger persons
                  naturally are to anybody (but themselves) talking-during the meal, and at the risk
                  of choking herself, the heroine of this sketch yet manages to edge in a word or
                  two. She informs Dick, that being out to-day she saw a little girl who—but bless
                  us, how can we follow the interminable rigmarole of Toddlekens' story; it has,
                  Heaven forgive her! the germs of scandal in it already. It relates to a certain
                  Fanny Fisher, who had her mamma's veil on, and who was not so nicely dressed as
                  you know who. The natural philosopher listens with scorn in his eye, and bread and
                  butter in his mouth. He is eager to tell a wondrous tale himself. He knows
                  something about school, and has a cut and dried story of certain schoolfellows,
                  whose Christian and surnames he serves up in a hash. There are Ebenezer Golding,
                  and John, and Tom, and Ferguson, Alexander, Jones, and Adam, and a certain boy who
                  can't write well, and one who is absolutely more than six, and yet cannot get
                  through the alphabet. At this flood of learning Toddlekens is as much abashed, as
                  a plain school man is before a flourishing university gent., with B. A. after his
                  name: and she holds her tongue. Taking advantage of this armistice, the larger
                  powers interfere, and tea is performed in peace.
               What does little Toddlekens do after?
               What! Why even Toddlekens is tired now, and she runs to her big
                  playfellow, and prefers a request that I would tell her a story. One
                  cannot deny the small solicitrix, and she climbs upon my knees anxious for the
                  fiction. But first she shall name the story. I am myself, I say it modestly, a
                  master of children's stories. I think I can beat Jack the Giant Killer, or
                  Hickathrift, or indeed many of those time-honored fictions. At any rate, I have a
                  kindly audience, who prefer my inventions to those of the illustrious authors of
                  the tales mentioned.
               Toddlekens, aided by the memory of the philosopher Dick, chooses her story
                  deliberately. She will not have "Pell Bones," because it consists of the history
                  of a little boy, who, having blacked his face, is stolen by a negro melodist, and
                  cruelly used. "Pell Bones" contains pathos, and makes her sad; nay, nor "Meddling
                  Margery;" but after due care in so weighty a suit, she selects the adventures of
                  "Tom Drum." Now Tom Drum's is a long
                  story. Having been presented with a military and musical (?) instrument bearing
                  his own name, he behaves selfishly in insisting upon letting no one but himself
                  play it, and goes through a variety of adventures which bring about his
                  punishment. Thus it is I preserve a poetic justice, and whilst pointing Tom Drum's
                  moral, take care also to adorn his tale. Although little Toddlekens and the
                  philosopher have heard this tale so often, that they can, and do, prompt me in
                  every part, and are as anxious as a Punch and Judy audience, that none of the
                  usual dramatis personæ should be omitted, yet
                  they wish it to be told "all over again." Oh, blessed freshness of young mental
                  digestions! Oh, that I too had a Tom Drum story which I could read and re-read. I
                  confess that many masterpieces, once eagerly perused, have now a soporific effect
                  upon me. I tried indeed but the other day to re-read the virtuous Pamela, but I
                  slept instead; so it is with Bore's novels and Jawaway's divinity. There are one
                  or two books ever new: and ONE, reader, which, if we strive to be as little
                  children, we shall never lose our taste for.
               But Toddlekens' mother intimates that it is time for bed, and after as tender a
                  leave-taking as such an awful separation requires, the young lady and gentleman
                  are removed; Mary Anne is the inexorable fate which bears them off; they are as
                  unwilling to lay down toy and story and go to bed, as we are to leave property and
                  ambition and go to sleep. The mother, to soothe this separation and to see her
                  treasures where they should be, departs with them, and in a short time I can hear,
                  through the half opened door, that prayer which becomes the child's lips, as well
                  as graces the tongue of the philosopher, and then "God bless papa and mamma, and
                  make us a good girl and boy." Amen to that, indeed, amen. A moment more, and
                  Toddlekens is asleep.
               After time not uselessly spent let me return again, and now unweariedly, to books.
                  I may see with a brightened mind some new idea in Plato, or I may perceive a
                  latent meaning which I missed before, taught by some hint gathered from a little
                  child. Who knows? The mind, indeed, is fresher from its rest, and I again go on
                  spinning the cocoon which must exhaust the grub at last, whilst Toddlekens and the
                  philosopher—fast asleep—hasten as quickly as their rapid pulse beats can bear them
                  to that time when they shall look down upon things as small as they are now, and,
                  perhaps, meditate as I do.
            
            
               
                  LOST HUSBAND; AN IRISH STORY.
                  
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        MARY Muldoon was, an Irish girl,
                     And as fine a one
                     As you'd look upon
                     In the cot of a peasant or hall of an earl.
                     Her teeth were white, but not of pearl;
                     And dark was her hair, but it did not curl;
                     Yet few who gazed on her teeth and her hair,
                     But owned that a "power" of beauty was there,
                     Which would make a man, whether he would or not, stare,
                     Till a longing would come, and a longing so "quare,"
                     To touch either or both—if he only dare.
                     Now many and many a rattling gossoon,
                     When this longing had tickled his heart into tune,
                     Had thrown his right wing around Mary Muldoon,
                     But for that in her eye,
                     Which made most of them shy,
                     And look so ashamed, though they couldn't tell why.
                     It wasn't a frown, nor was it a leer,
                     Nor the stony stare
                     That some great folk wear,
                     When they wish by their looks their own pomp to declare—
                     Though her glance had such power,
                     'Twas not "hatchet" or sour,
                     Nor the terrible glare of a spinster austere.
                     'Twas a piercing look, though mild the orb
                     From which the rays that made it flowed,
                     You'd swear it was such as would quite absorb
                     Whatever of thought in your own abode.
                     Her eyes were large, and dark, and clear,
                     And heart and mind seemed in them
                        blended;
                     
                     If intellect sent you one look severe,
                     
                        Love instantly leaped in the next to mend it.
                     Her's was the eye to check the rude,
                     And her's the eye to stir emotion,
                     To move the sense, yet make you good,
                     And calm desire into devotion.
                     As the boys after supper would sit by her side,
                     And gaze on her neck,
                     Without freckle or speck,
                     Whose white not the dust of a cabin could fleck;
                     And her glossy black hair—
                     Sure the like of it wasn't from Cork to Kildare—
                     That flowed to her own purty shoulders in pride.
                     Each felt—such a what! sure he couldn't quite say,
                     But each felt he was just in a terrible way
                     Of stealing a kiss if the rest were away.
                     But many were there,
                     And great was their fun;
                     So nobody dare
                     Steal a kiss—not one.
                     Stories, humor, jest, and glee,
                     Circled round right merrily;
                     And the joyous Irish heart
                     Turned up its brightest part,
                     And the merry Irish eye
                     Looked more wit than gold could buy;
                     And each roguish rival strove
                     By his wit to win his love,
                     While the baffled strove to screen
                     Bile, by smoking his "dudeen."
                     Now, though each had a jest or a story to tell
                     For the company's sake and the good of them all,
                     I'm sure each had a glance to bestow, too, as well;
                     And that glance wasn't spent on the boys or the wall.
                     'Twas given on the sly
                     To as bright a black eye
                     As e'er vollied its lustre to humble or high
                     And was met by that eye
                     With a beam which not I,
                     If sworn against love, would be willing to try;
                     And it was such a look.
                     So full and so sweet,
                     That one's heart-strings would beat
                     Till one's brain in a heat
                     Wouldn't deem't indiscreet
                     To fall down at her feet,
                     On the dirtiest day in the dirtiest street,
                     One's very frame shook
                     When her eye did open and his did
                        see't.
                  
                  
                     What marvel if beauty like this would arouse
                     The electric in hearts that are always on fire?
                     The broad breast of earth in the summer avows
                     To bright Heaven the sweets that its shining inspire.
                  
                  
                     Now more than one
                     Felt his heart thump on,
                     Till himself grew as weak as a "barley scon;"
                     Whilst one or two more
                     Tried their toes on the floor,
                     Till themselves and the company fell in a roar;
                     And each felt his spirit as light and as bright,
                     And as full of delight
                     As a fairy or sprite
                     Upon Auld Hallow's night;
                     Or to quote Paddy just in his own native phrase, he
                     Felt his whole soul quite as gay as a daisy.
                     But if any would prove in his gladness unwary,
                     And made rather free with the sweet colleen Mary,
                     One full look of her eye
                     Made the rough one "fight shy,"
                     And all-bashfully try
                     Just to slink to a corner, and keep himself "aisy."
                     There was Jemmy O'Hare,
                     Who was always there,
                     And as fine a lad as you'd see in a fair.
                     His face was round and his build was square,
                     And he sported as rare
                     And as tight a pair
                     Of legs, to be sure, as are found anywhere.
                     And Jemmy would wear
                     His "caubeen" and hair
                     
                     With such a peculiar and rollicking air,
                     And so coaxingly leer, that I'd venture to swear,
                     Not a girl in Kildare—
                     Or Victoria, perhaps, if she chanced to be there—
                     Could resist the wild way they call "Devil may care."
                  
                  
                     Not a boy in the parish could beat him for fun;
                     Nor wrestle, nor leap, nor hurl, nor run
                     With Jemmy. No gossoon could equal him—none,
                     At wake or at wedding, at feast or at fight,
                     At throwing the stone, or at flying the kite,
                     He was the envy of men and the women's delight.
                     Och! you couldn't discover, from Howth to Kinsale, a
                     Handier fist at his native shilelah.
                  
                  
                     Now Mary Muldoon did like Jemmy O'Hare
                     And in troth Jemmy loved in his heart Miss Muldoon;
                     And I b'lieve, in my conscience, a "purtier pair"
                     Never danced in a tent at a "patron" in June.
                     There they dance in a tent
                     To a bagpipe or fiddle
                     On a rough cabin-door
                     That is placed in the middle.
                     No "Polka," no waltz, no pas
                           seul or quadrille,
                     No "Prince," or "Mechi," or "Dupois," or "Jonquille."
                     Is there to teach toes how to caper with skill.
                     Yet talk as we will,
                     There's a grace in the limbs of the peasantry there
                     With which many at "Almack's" would dread to compare.
                     And Mary and Jemmy were counted the two
                     That could keep up the longest and go the best through
                     All the jigs and the reels
                     That have occupied heels
                     Since the reigns of the "Murtaghs" or wars of "Burhu."
                     Thus old ones would whisper to Mary's old mother—
                     "Orra, Mistress Muldoon,
                     Sure I'm thinking aroon,
                     That weddins are first settled up in the moon;
                     For, begor, that gossoon
                     And your Mol, Missus Doon,
                     Will be one very soon.
                     And well they loved—
                     And many a day
                     Sat on a green knoll side by side;
                     But neither just then had much to say;
                     Their hearts were so full that they only tried
                     To do anything foolish, just to hide
                     What both of them felt, but what Mary denied.
                     They pluck'd the innocent daisies that grew
                     Close by their elbows, then tore them too;
                     And the bright little leaves that they tore from the stalk
                     They threw at each other for want of talk;
                     While the heart-lit look, and the arch, arch smile
                     Of each was to each most delicious the while;
                     And every time Mary sighed or smiled,
                     Jem felt himself grow as soft as a child;
                     And he fancied the sky never looked so bright
                     Or the grass so green, or the daisies so white:
                     Everything looked so improved in his sight,
                     That he thought he'd be glad just to watch them till night;
                     And Mary herself believed each little bird,
                     Whose warble the notes in her own soul stirred,
                     Of course only sang by herself to be heard.
                     Thus the heart where true love lies
                     Makes everywhere a Paradise.
                  
                  
                     Now, sneer not, ye great, at the loves of the poor,
                     Though their manners be rude their affections are sure:
                     They look not by art, and they like not by rule,
                     For their souls are not tempered in fashion's cold school.
                  
                  
                     Oh! give me the love that will own no control
                     But the delicate instinct that pilots the soul,
                     As the mountain stream gushes, all freshness and force,
                     But obedient, wherever it flows, to its source.
                  
                  
                     Yes, give me the love that but nature has taught,
                     By rank unallured, and by riches unbought;
                     Whose very simplicity keeps it secure—
                     The love that illumines the hearts of the poor.
                  
                  
                     An Irish courtship's short and sweet:
                     When their hearts are lit,
                     
                     Their hands are knit,
                     And sorra bit
                     Does Paddy delay when the first fierce fit
                     Urges the venture—miss or hit.
                     It's neither wise nor yet discreet;
                     But who is wise when his passion's heat
                     Whips the pulse to a galloping beat,
                     Ties up his judgment neck and feet,
                     Makes him the fool of a blind conceit,
                     And, where he is foolish, won't let him see't.
                     Full of love and fond of fight,
                     Paddy's into both "at sight"—
                     Where love or glory
                     Shines before, he
                     Rushes, hurroo! to be smitten—to smite.
                  
                  
                     Mary blushed, or looked shy at least,
                     As one week after Lent
                     Jem procured her consent
                     To go the next Sunday and "spake to the priest."
                  
                  
                     His "Riv'rince" joked, then lectured Jem;
                     Jem looked down with pious awe,
                     And began to draw
                     The "dues" from his pocket, which, when the priest saw
                     He gave two little coughs and one long "Ahem,"
                     Rubbed his knees with one hand,
                     Took a pinch with the other,
                     And, exceedingly bland,
                     Said to Jem, "How's your mother?
                     Augh, she was the wife to your father, so kind;
                     When she's gone, sure, the likes of her won't be behind
                     For making 'scaltheen,' or attending a 'station.'
                     By the powers of delf,
                     Jem, St. Bridget herself
                     Couldn't bate her in mixing the 'clargy's potation.'
                     May Mary and you,
                     When I 'solder' ye two,
                     Be as fond of the priest and as sure of salvation."
                  
                  
                     His "Riv'rince" buttoned a pocket flap;
                     But first had he put in that pocket the "dues;"
                     Smiled he at Jem, saying, "Surely, my chap,
                     I'll buckle yees both now whenever yees choose."
                  
                  
                     The morn of the day
                     That the wedding was to be
                     Had dawned as bright and gay
                     As a bride would wish to see,
                     And Jemmy was up at the day's first peep;
                     Not a wink could Jem sleep—
                     One vigorous leap
                     Placed him on the floor and the clothes in a heap—
                     And a brand new coat, with a bright big button,
                     He took from a "chist," after shaving, and put on,
                     And brogues as well "lampblacked" as ever went foot on,
                     And greased with the fat of the finest of mutton;
                     And his new "corduroys,"
                     Bought in Dandy Molloy's,
                     Were an "iligant" fit, and looked well, by the boys.
                  
                  
                     A tidier gossoon couldn't be seen
                     Treading the emerald sod so green.
                     Light was his step and bright was his eye
                     As he walked through the "clobbery" streets of Athy;
                     And each lass that he passed bid "God bless him," and
                        sighed,
                     While she wished in her soul that herself was the bride.
                  
                  
                     The wedding-party are all together,
                     Laughing and talking of "Dan" and the "weather;"
                     Each heart in the company light as a feather,
                     Allowed no cold form its gushings to "tether:"
                     Stories were told by each gay old wife
                     Of the sweethearts she had in her early life; 
                     Of the pranks she played, and how little she thought
                     She was going to be married the day she was brought
                     To Father O'Shane's at a deuce of a trot,
                     Where "the words" were said and herself was caught.
                     Of crops and politics talked the men,
                     With a joke to the women now and then,
                     Who made it rebound with effect agen,
                     Till the laugh grew loud,
                     And the women so proud
                     That their witty replies had the men quite "cowed."
                     
                     Hush! here's the priest—let not the least
                     Whisper be heard till the father has ceased
                     "Come, bridegroom and bride,
                     That the knot may be tied
                     Which no power on earth can hereafter divide."
                     Up rose the bride and the bridegroom too,
                     And a passage was made for them both to walk through;
                     And his "Riv'rince" stood with a sanctified face,
                     Which spread its infection all round the place.
                     The bridesmaid bustled and whispered the bride,
                     Who felt so confused that she almost cried,
                     But at last bore up and walked forward, where
                     The "father" was standing with sanctified air;
                     The bridegroom was following after with pride,
                     When his piercing grey eye something awful espied;
                     
                        
                     
                     He stopped and sighed,
                     Looked round and tried
                     To tell what he saw, but his tongue denied:
                     With a spang and a roar
                     He jumped to the door,
                     And the bride "laid her eyes" on the bridegroom no more.
                  
                  
                     Some years sped on,
                     Yet heard no one
                     Of Jemmy O'Hara, or where he had gone.
                     After four summers, or three at least,
                     An American letter was brought to the priest,
                     Telling of Jemmy O'Hara, deceased,
                     Who, ere his death,
                     With his latest breath,
                     To a spiritual father unburdened his breast,
                     And the cause of his sudden departure confest.—
                     "Oh! Father," says he, "I've not long to live,
                     So I'll freely confess, if you freely forgive—
                     That same Mary Muldoon, sure I loved her indeed;
                     Ay, as well as the creed
                     That was never forsaken by one of my breed;
                     But I couldn't have married her after I saw"—
                     "Saw what?" cried the father, impatient to hear,
                     And the chair that he sat in impatiently rocking—
                     "Not in her 'karàcther,' yer Riv'rince, a flaw"—
                     The sick man here dropped a significant tear,
                     And expired as he breathed in the clergyman's ear—
                     "But I saw a TREMENDOUS BIG HOLE IN HER STOCKING!"
                  
               
               
                  THE MORAL.
                  
                     Lady readers, love may be
                     Fixed in hearts immovably,
                     May be strong, and may be pure;
                     Faith may lean on faith secure,
                     Knowing adverse fate's endeavor
                     Makes that faith more firm than ever
                     But the purest love and strongest,
                     Love that has endured the longest,
                     Braving cross, and blight, and trial,
                     Fortune's bar, or pride's denial,
                     Would—no matter what its trust—
                     Be uprooted by DISGUST:—
                     
                     Yes, the love that might for years
                     Spring in suffering, grow in tears,
                     Parent's frigid counsel mocking,
                     Might be—where's the use in talking?—
                     Upset by a BROKEN STOCKING!
                  
                  
                     
                  
               
            
            
               A LEAP YEAR LOVE SCENE.
               Young Albert Ringwood sat at home on New-Year's day, in dishabille. His beard was
                  unshaved, his hair was uncombed, his boots were unblacked, and he was leaning back
                  in a picturesque attitude, with his heels against the mantelpiece, smoking a
                  cigar. Albert thought to himself that this was leap-year, and how glorious it
                  would be if the ladies could be induced to pop the question, in accordance with
                  their ancient privileges. As he sat and watched the smoke which so gracefully
                  curled, his fancy glowed with the idea. How delightful it would be to have the
                  dear creatures fondling on him, and with tender glances endeavoring to do the
                  agreeable. As he meditated, his heart softened, and he began to feel a squeamish,
                  womanish sensibility diffuse itself over his feelings, and thought he would faint
                  with propriety the first time a lady should squeeze his hand.
               "Rap, rap, rap," sounded the door. Albert peeped through the Venetian blinds.
                  "Mercy," exclaimed he, "and if there isn't Miss Jones, and I all in dishabille,
                  and looking like a flight. Goodness gracious! I must go right away and fix
                  myself."
               As he left the room, Miss Susan Jones entered, and with composed air intimated
                  that she would wait. Susan Jones was a firm believer in woman's rights, and now
                  that the season was propitious she determined to take advantage thereof, and do a
                  little courting on her own hook. It was only woman's privilege, which had been
                  usurped by the tyrant, and she was determined to assert her rights in spite of the
                  hollow formalities of a false system of society.
               Meanwhile, with palpitating heart, Albert went through a series of personal
                  adornments. The last twist was given to his collar, the last curl to his whiskers,
                  and with white cambric in hand, he gave the order  to admit Miss Jones.
                  The aforesaid lady rushed toward him, knelt at his feet, and seizing his
                  hand—exclaimed passionately—"Dearest, how beautiful you look," accompanying her words with a glance of undisguised
                  admiration.
               "Spare the blushes of a modest young man," said Albert, applying his cambric to
                  his face to hide his confusion.
               "Nay, my love, why so coy?" said Susan; "turn not away those lovely eyes, dark as
                  the jet, but sparkling as the diamond. Listen to the vows of the fondest
                  affection. Here let us rest," said she, drawing him to the sofa; "here with my arm
                  round thee, will I protest my true affection."
               "Leave me, oh leave me," murmured Albert; "think of my youth, my
                  inexperience—spare, oh spare my palpitating heart."
               "Leave thee," said Susan, pressing him closer to her, "never, until the story of
                  restless nights, of unquiet days, of aspirations, fond emotions, and undying love
                  is laid before thee. Know that for years I have nursed for thee a secret passion.
                  Need I tell how each manly beauty moved me; how I worshipped like a sunflower in
                  the lurid light of those scarlet tresses; how my fond heart was entrapped in the
                  meshes of those magnificent whiskers; how I was willing to yield up to the
                  government of that 'imperial;' thy manners, so modest, so delicate, enchanted
                  me—were joy to me—for thy joy was my joy. My heart is thine—take it—but first let
                  me snatch one kiss from those ruby lips."
               The over-wrought feelings of the delicate youth were too strong and he fainted
                  from excess of joy. Meanwhile the enamored maiden hung over him, and—
               Slowly the eyes of Albert opened—he gazed wildly round him—then meeting the ardent
                  gaze of his "lover," he blushed deeply, and behind his 'kerchief faintly faltered
                  out—"Ask my pa."
            
            
               THE MAGIC PHIAL.
               
                  
                  TO home," said the portly Peter Von Voorst, as he buttoned up his
                  money in the pockets of his capacious breeches, "home to my farm, and to-morrow
                  I'll buy neighbor Jan Hagen's two cows, which are the best in Holland."
               He crossed the market-place of Delft as he spoke, with an elated and swaggering
                  air, and turned down one of the streets which led out of the city, when a goodly
                  tavern met his eye. Thinking a dram would be beneficial in counteracting the
                  effects of a fog which was just rising, he entered, and called for a glass of
                  schiedam. This was brought, and drank by Peter, who liked the flavor so much that
                  he resolved to try the liquor diluted. Accordingly, a glass of a capacious size
                  was set before him. After a few sips of the pleasing spirit, our farmer took a
                  view of the apartment in which he was sitting, and, for the first time, perceived
                  that the only person in the room besides himself was a young man of melancholy
                  aspect, who sat near the fire-place, apparently half asleep. Now, Peter was of a
                  loquacious turn, and nothing rendered a room more disagreeable to him than the
                  absence of company. He, therefore, took the first opportunity of, engaging the
                  stranger in conversation.
               "A dull evening, mynheer," said the farmer.
               "Yaw!" replied the stranger, stretching himself, and yawning loudly, "very foggy,
                  I take it;" and he rose, and looked into the street.
               Peter perceived that his companion wore a dress of dark brown, Of the cut of the
                  last century. A thick row of brass buttons ornamented his doublet; so thickly,
                  indeed, were they placed, that they appeared one stripe of metal. His shoes were
                  high-heeled and square-toed, like those, worn by a company of maskers, represented
                  in a picture which hung in Peter's parlor at Voorbooch. The stranger was of a
                  spare figure, and his countenance was, as before stated, pale; but there was a
                  wild brightness in his eye, which inspired the farmer with a feeling of awe.
               After takings a few turns up and down the apartment, the stranger drew a chair
                  near to Peter, and sat down.
               
               "Are you a burgher of Delft?" he inquired.
               "No!" was the reply; "I am a small farmer, and live in the village of
                  Voorbooch."
               "Umph!" said the stranger, "you have a dull road to travel! See! your glass is
                  out. How like ye mine host's schiedam?"
               "'Tis right excellent."
               "You say truly," rejoined the stranger, with a smile, which the farmer thought
                  greatly improved his countenance; "but here is a liquor which no burgomaster in
                  Holland can procure. 'Tis fit for a prince."
               He drew forth a phial from the breast of his doublet, and, mixing a small quantity
                  of the red liquid it contained with some water that stood on the table, he poured
                  it into Peter's empty glass. The farmer tasted it, and found it to excel every
                  liquid he had ever drunk. Its effect was soon visible; he pressed the hand of the
                  stranger with great warmth, and swore he would not leave Delft that night.
               "You are perfectly right," said his companion; "these fogs are unusually heavy;
                  they are trying, even to the constitution of a Hollander. As for me, I am nearly
                  choked with them. How different is the sunny clime of Spain, which I have just
                  left."
               "You have travelled, then?" said Peter, inquiringly.
               "Travelled! ay, to the remotest corner of the Indies, amongst Turks, Jews, and
                  Tartars."
               "Eh! but does it please ye to travel always in that garb, mynheer?"
               "Even so," replied the stranger; "it has descended from father to son, through
                  more than three generations. See you this hole on the left breast of my
                  doublet?"
               The farmer stretched out his neck, and by the dim light perceived a small
                  perforation on the breast of the stranger's doublet, who continued—
               "Ah the bullet that passed through it lodged in the heart of my great-grandsire,
                  at the sack of Zutphen."
               "I have heard of the bloody doings at that place from my grand father—Heaven rest
                  his soul!"
               Peter was startled on perceiving the unearthly smile which played over the
                  countenance of the stranger on his hearing this pious ejaculation. He muttered to
                  himself, in an inaudible tone, the word Duyvel! but was interrupted by the loud
                  laugh of his companion, who slapped him on the shoulder, and cried, "Come, come,
                  mynheer, you look sad does not my liquor sit well on your stomach?"
               "'Tis excellent!" replied Peter, ashamed to think that the stranger had observed
                  his confusion: "Will you sell me your phial?" 
               
               "I had it from a dear friend, who has been long since dead," replied the stranger;
                  "he strictly enjoined me never to sell it, for, d'ye see, no sooner
                  is it emptied than, at the wish of the possessor, it is immediately refilled; but,
                  harkee, as you seem a man of spirit, it shall be left to chance to decide who
                  shall possess it." Hie took from his bosom a bale of dice: "I will stake it
                  against a guilder."
               "Good," said Peter, "but I fear there is some devilry in the phial."
               "Pshaw!" cried his companion, with a bitter smile, "those who have travelled
                  understand these things better. Devilry, forsooth!"
               
               "I crave your pardon," said Peter; "I will throw for it;" and he placed a guilder
                  on the table.
               The farmer met with ill luck and lost. He took a draught of his companion's
                  liquor, and determined to stake another guilder; but he lost that also! Much
                  enraged at his want of success, he drew forth the canvass bag which contained the
                  produce of the sale of his corn, and resolved either to win the phial (the
                  contents of which had gone far to fuddle his senses), or lose all. He threw again
                  with better luck; but, elated at this, he played with less caution, and in a few
                  minutes was left pennyless. The stranger gathered up the money, and placed it in
                  his pocket.
               "You are unlucky to-night, mynheer," said he, with provoking indifference, which
                  greatly increased the farmer's chagrin; "but come, you have a goodly ring on your
                  finger; will you not venture that against my phial?"
               The farmer paused for a moment—it was the gift of an old friend; yet he could not
                  stomach the idea of being cleared of his money in such a manner; what would Jan
                  Brower, the host of the Van Tromp, and little Kip Winkelaar, the
                  schoolmaster, say to it? It was the first time he had ever been a loser in any
                  game, for he was reckoned the best hand at ninepins in the village; he, therefore,
                  took the ring from his finger, threw again, and lost it!
               He sank back into his chair with a suppressed groan, at which his companion
                  smiled. The loss of his money, together with this ring, had nearly sobered him,
                  and he gazed on the stranger with a countenance indicative of anything but good
                  will; while the latter drew from his bosom a scroll of parchment.
               "You grieve," said he, "for the loss of a few paltry guilders; but know that I
                  have the power to make you amends for your ill luck—to make you rich—ay, richer
                  than the Stadtholder!"
               "Ha! the fiend!" thought Peter, growing still soberer, while he drank in every
                  word, and glanced at the legs of the stranger, expecting, of course, to see them,
                  as usual, terminate with a cloven foot; but he beheld no such unsightly spectacle;
                  the feet of the stranger were as perfect as his own, or even more so.
               "Here," said his companion, "read over this, and, if the terms suit you, subscribe
                  your name at foot." The farmer took the parchment, which he perceived was closely
                  written, and contained many signatures at the bottom. His eye glanced hastily over
                  the first few lines, but they sufficed.
               "Ha I now I know thee, fiend!" screamed the affrighted Peter, as he dashed the
                  scroll in the face of the stranger, and rushed wildly out of the room. He gained
                  the street, down which he fled with the swiftness of the wind, and turned quickly,
                  thinking he was safe from the vengeance of him who he now supposed to be no other
                  than the foul fiend himself, when the stranger met him on the opposite side, his
                  eyes dilated to a monstrous size, and glowing like red-hot coals. A deep groan
                  burst from the surcharged breast of the unfortunate farmer as he staggered back
                  several paces.
               "Avaunt! avaunt!" he cried, "Satan, I defy theme! I have not; signed that cursed
                  parchment!" He turned and fled in the opposite direction; but, though he exercised
                  his utmost speed, the stranger, without any apparent exertion, kept by his side.
                  At length he arrived at the bank of the canal, and leaped into a boat which was
                  moored alongside. Still his pursuers followed, and Peter felt the iron grasp of
                  his hand on the nape of his neck. He turned round and struggled hard to free
                  himself from the gripe of his companion, roaring out in agony, "Oh! Mynheer
                  Duyvel! have pity, for the sake of my wife and my boy Karl!" But when was the
                  devil ever known to pity? The stranger held him tightly, and spite of his
                  struggles, dragged him ashore. He felt the grasp of his pursuer like the clutch of
                  a bird of prey, while his hot breath almost scorched him; but disengaging himself,
                  with a sudden bound, he sprang from his enemy, and—pitched  headlong from
                  his elbow-chair on the floor of his own room at Voorbooch.
               
               The noise occasioned by the fail of the burly Hollander aroused his affrighted
                  helpmate from the sound slumber she had been wrapped in for more than two hours,
                  during which time her husband had been indulging in potations deep and strong,
                  until overpowered with the potency of his beloved liquor, he had sunk to sleep in
                  his elbow-chair, and dreamed the hellish dreams we have endeavored to relate. The
                  noise of his fall aroused his vrow from her
                  slumbers. Trembling in every limb on hearing the unruly sound below, she descended
                  by a short flight of steps, screaming aloud for help, into the room where she had
                  left her spouse when she retired to rest, and beheld Peter, her dear husband,
                  prostrate on the stone floor, the table overturned, his glass broken, and the
                  remainder of the accursed liquor flowing in a stream from the stone bottle which
                  lay upset on the floor.
            
            
               "POPPING THE QUESTION."
               
                  
                  ABOUT twenty years ago (I was not then so bald as I am now) I was
                  spending, the midsummer with my old friend and school fellow Tom Merton. Tom had
                  married early in life and had a daughter, Mary Rose, who to her "mother's wit and
                  mother's beauty" added her uncle Absalom's good humor and Aunt Deborah's
                  notability. In her you had the realization of all that poets have sung about fairy
                  forms, dulcet voices, and witching eyes. She was just such a being as you may
                  imagine to yourself in the heroine of some beautiful romance. My heart was
                  susceptible and I fell in love. No man, I thought, had ever loved as I did—a
                  common fancy among lovers—and the intensity of my affection, I believed, would not
                  fail to secure a return.
               The blindness incidental to my passion, and the young lady's uniform kindness, led
                  me to believe that the possibility of her becoming my wife was by no means so
                  remote as at first it had appeared to be; and having spent several sleepless
                  nights in examining the subject on all sides, I determined to make her an offer of
                  my hand and bear the result, PRO OR CON., with all due philosophy. For more than a
                  week I was disappointed in an opportunity of speaking alone with my adored.
               At length the favorable moment seemed to be at hand. A charity sermon was to be
                  preached by the bishop for the benefit of a Sunday school, and as Mr. Merton was
                  church warden, and destined to Hold one of the plates, it became imperative on his
                  family to be present on the occasion. I of course, proffered my services, and it
                  was arranged that we should set off early next morning, to secure good seats in
                  the centre aisle. I could hardly close my eyes that night for thinking how I
                  should "pop the question;" and when I did get a short slumber, was waked on a
                  sudden by some one starting from behind a hedge, just as I was disclosing the soft
                  secret. Sometimes when I fancied myself sitting by the lovely Mary, in a bower of
                  jessamine and roses, and had just concluded a beautiful rhapsody about loves and
                  doves, myrtles and turtles, I raised my blushing head, and found myself
                  TETE-A-TETE with her papa. At another moment she would slip a beautiful pink, hot-
                     presed
                     pressed
                   billet-doux into my hand, which, when I unfolded it, would turn out to
                  be a challenge from some favored lover, desiring the satisfaction of meeting me at
                  half-past six in the morning, and so forth, and concluding, as usual, with an
                  indirect allusion to a horsewhip. Morning dreams, they say, always come true. It
                  is a gross falsehood; mine never came true. But I had a pleasant vision that
                  morning, and, recollecting the gossip's tale, I fondly hoped it would be verified.
                  Methought I had ventured to "pop the question" to my Dulcinea, and was accepted. I
                  jumped out of the bed in a tremor. "Yes," I cried, "I WILL pop the question! Ere
                  this night can again envelope this unhappy head, the trial shall be made!" And I
                  shaved, and brushed my hair over the bald place on my crown, and tied my cravat
                  with unprecedented care.
               Breakfast time at length arrived. But I shall pass over the blunders I committed
                  during its progress; how I salted Mary Rose's muffin instead of my own, poured the cream into the
                  sugar-basin, and took a bite at the tea-pot lid. 'Pop the question' haunted me
                  continually, and I feared to speak, even on the most ordinary topics, lest I
                  should in some way betray myself. Pop—pop—pop! everything seemed to go off with a
                  pop; and when at length Mr. Merton hinted to Mary and her mother that it was time
                  for them to pop on their bonnets, I thought he laid a particular
                  stress on the horrible monosyllable, and almost expected him to accuse me of some
                  sinister design upon his daughter. It passed off, however, and we set out for the
                  church. Mary Rose leaned upon my arm, and complained how dull I was. I, of course,
                  protested against it, and tried to rally. Vivacity, indeed, was one of my
                  characteristics, and I was just beginning to make myself extremely agreeable, when
                  a little urchin, in the thick gloom of a dark entry, let off a pop-gun close to my
                  ear. The sound, simple as it may seem, made me start as if a ghost had stood
                  before me; and when Mary observed that I was 'very nervous this morning,' I felt
                  as if I could have throttled the lad, and inwardly cursed the inventor of
                  pop-guns, and doomed him to the lowest pit of Acheron.
               I strove against my fate, however, and made several observations. "Look," cried
                  Mary Rose, as we gained the end of the street, "what a beautiful child!"
               I turned my head to the window, when the first object that met my eyes was a
                  square blue paper, edged with yellow, on which was written in too, too legible
                  characters, "Pop!" I believe I was surprised into an exclamation
                  stronger than the occasion would seem to warrant, and the poor child came in for a
                  share of my anathema. I didn't intend it, however, for I was very fond of
                  children; but it served Mary Rose to scold me about till we came to the church
                  door, and, if possible, bewildered me wore than ever. We had now arrived in the
                  middle aisle when my fair companion whispered to me, "Mr., dear Mr.—, won't you
                  take off your hat?" This was only a prelude to still greater blunders. I posted
                  myself at the head of the seat, sang part of the hundredth psalm while the
                  organist was playing the symphony, sat down when I should have stood up, knelt
                  when I ought to have been standing, and just at the end of the creed found myself
                  pointed due west, the gaze and wonder of the whole congregation.
               The sermon then commenced. Just as the rest of the congregation were going to
                  sleep, I began to wake up from my mental lethargy. Just at this moment too a
                  thought struck me, beautiful as it was sudden—a plan by which I might make the
                  desired tender of my person, and display an abundance of wit into the bargain.
               To this end I seized Mary Rose's prayer-book, and turning over the pages till I
                  came to "Matrimony," marked the passage, "Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded
                  husband?" with two emphatic dashes, and pointing confidently to myself, handed it
                  to her with a bow. She took it! she read it!! and with a slight drooping of the
                  eyelids, and apparently a smile of assent. Oh! how throbbed my bosom at that
                   instant—so loud that the people around us might hear its palpitations,
                  and I looked at them to see if they noticed me.
               She turned over a few leaves—took my pencil and marked a passage. O ye gods and
                  demigods, what were my sensations at that moment! Not Jove himself when he went a
                  swan-hopping to the lovely Leda—nor Pluto when he perpetrated the abduction of the
                  beautiful Proserpine—could have experienced a greater turmoil of passions than I
                  at that moment. I felt the score—felt it across my very heart; and I grasped the
                  book, and squeezed the hand that presented it. Opening the page tremblingly, and
                  holding the volume close to my eyes (for the type was small and my sight not quite
                  so good as it used to be), I read———O, Mary Rose! Mary Rose! that I should live to
                  relate it—"A woman may not marry her grandfather."
            
            
               
               A SAN FRANCISCO AUCTIONEER.
               
                  
                  NOW, ladies and gentlemen, I now have the honor of putting up a fine
                  pocket handkerchief, a yard wide, a yard long, and almost a yard thick; one half
                  cotton, and t'other half cotton too; beautifully printed with stars and stripes on
                  one side, and the stripes and stars on t'other. It will wipe dust from the eyes so
                  completely as to be death to demagogues, and make politics as bad a business as
                  printing papers. Its great length, breadth, and thickness, together with its dark
                  color, will enable it to hide dirt, and never need washing. Going at one dollar?
                  seventy-five cents? fifty cents twenty-five cents? one bit? Nobody wants it! Oh!
                  thank you, sir! Next, gentlemen—for the ladies won't be permitted to bid on this
                  article, is real, simon pure, tempered, highly-polished, keen-edged Sheffield
                  razor; bran spanking new; never opened before to sunlight, moonlight, starlight,
                  daylight, or gaslight; sharp enough to shave a lawyer, or cut a disagreeable
                  acquaintance, or poor relation; handle of buck horn, with all the rivets but the
                  two at the ends of pure gold. Who will give two dollars? one dollar? half a
                  dollar? Why, ye long-bearded, dirty-faced reprobates, with not room on your
                  phizzes for a Chinese woman to kiss, I'm offering you a bargain at half a dollar!
                  Well, I'll throw in this strop at half a dollar! razor and strop! a recent patent;
                  two rubs upon it will sharpen the City Attorney; all for four bits; and a piece of
                  soap, sweeter than roses, lathers better than a schoolmaster, and strong enough to
                  wash all the stains from a California politician's countenance, all for four bits.
                  Why, you have only to put the razor, strop, and soap under your pillow at night,
                  and wake up in the morning clean shaved. Won't anybody give two bits, then, for
                  the lot? I knew I would sell them! Next, ladies and gentlemen, I offer three pair
                  socks, hose, stockings, or half hose, just as you're a mind to call them, knit by
                  a machine made on purpose, out of cotton wool. The man that buys these will be
                  enabled to walk till he gets tired; and, provided his boots are big enough,
                  needn't have any corns; the legs are long as bills against the corporation, and as
                  thick as the heads of the members of the Legislature. Who wants 'em at one half
                  dollar? Thank-ee, madam, the money. Next, I offer you a pair of boots made
                  especially for San Francisco, with heels long enough to raise a man up to the
                  Hoadley grades, and nails to ensure against being carried over by a land slide;
                  legs wide enough to carry two revolvers and a bowie knife, and the upper of the
                  very best horse leather. A man in these boots can move about as easy as the State
                  capitol. Who says twenty dollars? All the tax-payers ought to buy a pair to kick
                  the council with, everybody ought to have a pair to kick the Legislature with, and
                  they will be found of assistance in kicking the bucket, especially if somebody
                  should kick at being kicked. Ten dollars for legs, uppers, and soles! while souls,
                  and miserable souls at that, are bringing twenty thousand dollars in Sacramento!
                  Ten dollars! ten dollars! gone at ten dollars! Next is something that you ought to
                  have, gentlemen—a lot of good gallowses—sometimes called suspenders. I know that
                  some of you will after a while be furnished at the State's expense, but you can't
                  tell which one, so buy where they're cheap. All that deserve to be hanged are not
                  supplied with a gallows; if so, there would be nobody to make laws, condemn
                  criminals, or hang culprits, until a new election. Made of pure
                  gum-elastic—stretch like a judge's conscience, and last as long as a California
                  office-holder will steal; buckles of pure iron, and warranted to hold so tight
                  that no man's wife can rob him of the breeches; are, in short, as strong, as good,
                  as perfect, as effectual, and as bona fide as the ordinance against Chinese shops
                  on Dupont-street—gone at twenty-five cents."
            
            
               "SHMELL TE SHUG."—An eccentric German was noted for making and keeping good cider,
                  and for his extreme stinginess in dispensing it to his neighbors. A Yankee
                  resolved to try his hand on the old fellow, and coax a pitcher of cider out of
                  him. He made him a call, and praised up his farm and cattle, and, speaking of his
                  fine orchard, casually remarked:
               "I hear, Mr. Von Dam, that you make excellent cider."
               "Yesh, yesh, I dosh. Hans, bring te cider shug."
               The Yankee was delighted at his success, and already smacked his lips in
                  anticipation of good things to come. Hans brought up a quart jug of cider and
                  placed it on the table before his father. The old farmer raised it with both
                  hands, and gluing his lips to the brim, he drained it to the bottom; then handing
                  the empty jug to the thirsty Yankee, he quietly observed:
               "Dare! if you don' pleve dat ish goot cider, shust you shmell te
                     shug!
               
            
            
               
               GREAT WESTERN SKETCHES.
               BY A ROVING ENGLISHMAN.
               
                  
                  PERHAPS YOU have never been to New York? well, after a stormy
                  passage we came in sight of the shores of America, and before us lay the entrance
                  to the harbor, contracted by two necks of land into a narrow passage, guarded on
                  either side by a small fort. Beyond these spreads out the Bay which bears New
                  York—"The Empire City" of the New World—upon its bosom; the distance bounded by
                  the green hills of Staten Island and New Jersey.
               Such is the scene which welcomes the wanderer to the shores of Manhattan. At all
                  times lovely in its features,—glowing and bright in climate, luxuriant beyond
                  compare in vegetation, most rich in verdure,—its every charm is multiplied a
                  thousand-fold when its fresh beauties greet an eye wearied with the monotonous
                  glare of a sea-voyage. Oh, welcome sight of Mother earth!—so glad to all thy sons,
                  that no one after-scene throughout that Western World—replete with natural
                  beauties as it is—has ever power to efface the pleasant memory of that green and
                  glorious shore.
               First impressions are very important matters.
               First impressions have a remarkable tendency towards prejudice; and prejudice is
                  very much given to misrepresentation.
               Jonathoniana have been very much in vogue of late years. A Yankee's "sentiment" is
                  generally supposed to consist in sitting on a pike fence in a thunderstorm,
                  smoking a "long nine," and picking his teeth with a pine-wood chip. As for the
                  ladies our conceit imagines them to be represented rather favorably than otherwise
                  by that steam-boat coquette in the far-west, who, when asked by a fellow-passenger
                  whether she would take a slice of roast turkey, replied, "Thank yer purdigiously,
                  mister; but I'd purfur a pretty little immoderate gob of them bababby
                  sassengers."
               I therefore was obliged to bring my first impressions to a full maturity, before I
                  could venture to pronounce upon their shape and color.
               And here they are.
               "Well, I!—why, nonsense. This ar'n't yeu? Well—I never—your name's Wildrake,
                  ar'n't it? A freend of my freend Hogden the consul? Mine's Cole—Kit Cole, from
                  Chawsplinter Creek, away south. Well, no matter—I heerd the ship was chuck, and
                  yeu heer—so I came to look yeu up at once. How long have yeu been in the
                  city?"
               "Just half an hour."
               "Guessed as much—then I reckon you haven't seen nothin'—not, the Park—nor
                  Broadway—nor the Avenoo—nor the Bowery—nor the 
                     Mr. Kit Cole
                   Battery. And yeu hav'n't called none—nor left no cards, nor compliments,
                  nor none o' them kind o' things. Nor been to Niblo's—nor dined at the Globe—nor
                  supped at the Terrapin Lunch, nor the Shakespere spere—nor had a mint-julep at—— —nor seen Kurnel
                  Webb—nor been to Hoboken—nor Brooklyn—-nor Staten Island—nor up the Hudson, nor
                  nowhere. Come—hang on—I'll scorch yer."
               So saying, my new ally swung towards the door.
               "Well, ar'n't yeu comin'? Oh! well, I see—yeu ar'n't quite used yet. Well, time's
                  enough;" and with that he threw himself into a rocking-chair; pitched his feet
                  some twenty inches higher than his head on the window-ledge; drew out a cigar,
                  lighted his principe, and commenced alternately to puff, and rock, and spit.
               He was a tall, gaunt, sinewy young fellow; as strong as Hercules, as brown as Pan,
                  and as awkward as a newly-caught Satyr. His countenance was cast-iron—his
                  complexion sallow—his eyes deeply set, dark, and cunning. His dress was rather
                  roomy than elegant; his coat large, and blue, with brass buttons; his waistcoat
                  wide, and of a thunder-and-lightning pattern; his collars high, and limp, and
                  ravelly. Moreover, his things flew about him like streamers, inasmuch as he only
                  buttoned the buttons of necessity.
               "Come," said he, as I finished this cursory survey of his outward man from the
                  corners of my eyes, "what on 'arth are yeu glowrin' at? Yeu don't seem used to the
                  sight o' men. Well, preehaps one does feel a queery fish when one's jest off sea.
                  But however, fix yerself right an' tight, an' I'll track with ye down to the
                  Customus, an' get old Schell to pass yer plunder. So yeu jest get in fix while I
                  go and take a horn. I'll be back now as soon as a man 'ud whip his mother—" and
                  away he went.
               Here was a first impression!
               "Come on," shouted Mr. Cole, bursting into my room again at the expiration of ten
                  minutes, with the force of a sucking hurricane, "the jig's up. Come on, ye're all
                  in fix now. Who on 'arth told you to come to the Astor House? It's jest about the
                  biggest best bit of a house in these United States; but it's a bad house for
                  horns—they carn't come drinks—they carn't mix mint-juleps."
               "What is a mint-julep?"
               "What's a mint-julep? Well, I am blamed! What's a mint-julep? What's
                  a coon? Hoh! why where on 'arth was yeu raised, not to know what's a mint-julep?
                  Preehaps yeu never seen a hailstorm, nor a ginsling, nor an apple-toddy, nor a
                  cocktail, nor a porteree, nor an eggnog, nor a sangaree, nor a gingeroo? Well, I
                  never—you Britishers are queer cods—yeu are—or I wish
                     I may be blamed. But here's Broadway."
               As Mr. Cole spoke, we emerged from the massive entrance of "the Mammoth Hotel,"
                  and stood in Broadway. Immediately before us was the Park, a large railed square
                  of grass, fringed with trees, and ornamented on the further side by the City Hall.
                  On either side of the enclosure ran two main streets, meeting at an angle of the
                  Park, so as to form a letter Y: the right branch of which, as we stood at the
                  fork, led off to the St. Giles's, and the left branch to the St. James's, quarter
                  of the city; whilst the tail was that commercial thoroughfare, par excellence
                  called "Broadway," and which terminated in the Bowling Green, the Battery and the
                  Bay.
               The scene, as we turned town the street towards the water, was very striking.
                  Hundreds of vehicles of every kind—private carriages, heavily-laden wagons, empty
                  trucks, four-horse omnibuses, two-horse "hacks," all were urging their way through
                  a gordian knot of difficulties at a high pressure pace amidst a stunning chorus of
                  shouts and curses, and cracking whips. The struggling crowd, as we looked down
                  upon them from the steps of the hotel, could only be likened to a lump of
                  microscopic eels in paste. The architectural arrangement of the street was very
                  irregular. Here a church, there a block of stores, then a garden, after that an
                  inn, then stores again, and so on, up and down, an
                     infinitum; whilst all the styles and orders of every clime and
                  country seemed mixed up in most admirable disregard of order.
               A very gay and picturesque appearance was, however, given to them all, by the
                  variety of gaily-colored awnings which shaded almost every window; and it was
                  refreshing for the eye to rest, amid the dust and boiling turmoil of the street,
                  upon the green locust and acacia trees which lined the edge of the foot-pavement,
                  affording shade and shelter to a heap of niggers, sawing firewood; of porters,
                  waiting for a hiring; or of Paddy-whack hackmen, eagerly plying for a fare with
                  most harmonious brogue.
               Busy as was the scene in general, the uproar in the street, at the moment of our
                  egress from the hotel, was increased ten fold by a race, then and there actually
                  coming off. A well-known sporting character of the city had made a bet that he
                  would drive his "Newark waggon" (a light carriage with two horses) the whole
                  length of Broadway at its most crowded hour, faster than his opponent could
                  perform the distance on foot, on the foot-pavement. The fun was at
                  its height as we stepped out. In the centre of the street was the sporting
                  charioteer, stuck fast between a Flatbush waggon and a loaded truck, and making
                  equally good use of a quick tongue and a heavy whip, with both of which he let out
                  freely on all sides. In the meantime his opponent, steaming and stewing under the
                  heat of a broiling sun was rushing,
                  like a maniac along the footway, jostling one, hustling another; upsetting a
                  third, and all the while shouting at the top of his lungs for a clear course. A
                  clear course in Broadway, at mid-day! Rare notion! However, on he ran, screeching
                  at the top of his voice, and after him a crowd of little boys and lazy loafers,
                  who, having nothing better to amuse them, watched the match with eager interest.
                  "Now, Stevens, work ahead—you've the track—lap him—the waggon's fixed almighty
                  still—go it, legs—now, wheels—I'll bet two mint-juleps to a cocktail on
                  toes—hullalaroo—mind the applewoman—see, the waggon's free—yep—yoho." And as the
                  waggon dashed forward in pursuit of the pedestrian, who had now gained some
                  headway, the whole population—white, black, joined in the hue and cry, and rushed
                  after their several champions as eagerly as if their fate hung on the issue.
               "Now, then," quoth Mr. Cole, "here's the come in. Here's a feller yeu must know—a
                  chap who'd make mince-meat of all creation in five minutes, and whip his weight in
                  wild cats while yeu swallowed a horn. I'll tell yer, he can float
                  farther, swim faster, dive deeper, and come up drier than any I ever
                     did see—he can. Oh! he is a downright,
                  upright, shingle-splitter, he is. Yeu must cotton to Mat
                  Doubleton."
               "Doubleton!—what, of the Devil's Horn on the Little Sulphur?"
               "The very—yeu've a ticket to him; well, he is an angel—but come, put
                  out."
               So saying, we entered the hotel; and finding, on inquiry at the bar, that Mr.
                  Doubleton, contrary to the usual early habit of the New World, was still in his
                  room, we walked directly up to No. 42, in the sky-parlors.
               There was no need to knock at the door; it was wide open; and as we approached, a
                  dialogue was in full play between the "Angel" and the Irish chambermaid. (All the
                  chamber-jewels of New York being emeralds.)
               "Burn me, Mary," roared the Angel, "why the 'tarnal heap didn't you rouse me more
                  airly? Here's noon past, and the muskeeters have a'most clawed my eyes out. It's
                  no use—none. Them devils 'ud eat through an iron pot; you couldn't keep 'em out,
                  if you slept with yer head in a steam-biler—that you couldn't. Come, whar's my hot
                  water, you Mississippi-ringtail-roarer, yeu?"——
               "Och, shure yer hanner's hot water's cold—an' brakefast's a-waitin—an' all your
                  Southerners lies in bed all day till to-morrow—an'"—
               Here we interrupted the discourse by entering a little low room, "cabined,
                  cribbed, confined," miserably furnished with a short truckle-bed without hangings,
                  and a rush-bottomed chair, on which stood a blue-and-white basin, and a soap-dish.
                  Before a small looking-glass, with his back to the door, and a coverlet from his
                  bed doing duty on his shoulders for a dressing-gown, stood the redoubtable Matthew
                  Doubleton, Esq., of the Devil's Horn, on the little Sulphur, Mississippi 
               
               "Well, Mat," began Mr. Cole—giving the coverlet a pull which at once dragged it
                  off the Angel's shoulders—"what's up now? Here's a man from the Old Country's got
                  a ticket for yer to show him sights in Mississippi."
               "Well, an' he'll see sights thar, I reckon," replied Mat; "he won't see anythin'
                  like it any other war—that you may swear. But you're welcome, strannger;" and we
                  shook hands.
               "So, Mat," resumed Mr. Cole, "how's the hunt—have you chanced upon him?"
               "Not clinched him," was Mat's reply, "but I'm on his tracks. He's somewhere down
                  these diggins. I reckon I'll hit him off about Westpoint, or Saratoga, or some o'
                  these northern skylarking bottoms; and then, burn me but I'm down on him like a
                  duck on a June bug."
               "What friend is Mr. Doubleton looking for?" innocently inquired I.
               
               "Freend! Well, I! that does whip all. I'll tell yer. Some strannger,
                  awhile ago, put some arkwardness, d'ye see, on Mat's sister at a gatherin'; so
                  having nothin' better to do this summer, he's jest made tracks up north here after
                  him, to look up a 'pology."
               "You don't mean that he has come a thousand miles to fight a man?"
               "I reckon that's jest about what yeu'll make of it—and I'll go a shin-plaster—and
                  plank the eel-skins—that he makes holes in him. But where's yer heading? Mat and I
                  are going to the Long Island races to-morrer; and next day we make tracks up the
                  Hudson to look up Mat's skeary strannger. Yeu'l come o'course?"
               "Oh! anything. I'm unanimous."
               As I wish it to be very clearly understood that facts alone will, at all times,
                  form the staple of these sketches—truth being at all times, in my experience,
                  stranger than fiction—it may interest the reader to learn that Mat's "skeary
                  strannger," being "looked up" at Westpoint, made an ample apology for all errors,
                  past and to come, to the immense disappointment of Kit Cole, who was very anxious
                  to see a little of his friend's ball practice.
               Thus much, then, for my first impressions; but my heart clings still around Kit
                  Cole in fond remembrance of the fact that he first taught my lips to love
                  MINT-JULEP.
               The Hero of the following story must have been a brother of Kit's.
               Among the Americans who attended a late ball given at the Hotel de Ville, Paris,
                  was Jack Cole, of Kentucky. Jack rushed the dress somewhat strong, and
                  consequently was the observed of all observers, and got mixed up with a party that
                  his friends could not account for. Wherever the Marshals of France went there went
                  Jack, and when the Marshals sat down Jack did the same, always taking the post of
                  honor. The day after the ball Jack called on his old acquaintance, Mr. Mason, our
                  Minister to France, who started up a little conversation in the following
                  manner:
               "I hear you were at the ball last night?"
               "I was, Sir, and I had a high old time."
               "For which you were indebted, I suppose, to the high old company you got mixed up
                  with? By the way, how came you associated with the Marshals?"
               "How? by virtue of my office; they were Marshals of France, while I am nothing
                  else than Marshal of the Republic. I showed my commission and took post
                  accordingly."
               "By right of your office! What do you mean?"
               "Read that and see."
               Here Jack presented Mr. Mason with a whity-brown paper with a seal big enough for
                  a four-pound weight.
               "What in the name of heaven is this?"
               "My commission of 'Marshal.' I received it in 1850 when I assisted in taking the
                  census of Frankfort."
               "You don't mean to say that you travel on this?"
               "I don't mean anything else. That makes me a 'Marshal' of the Republic, and I
                  intend to have the office duly honored."
               Mr. Mason allowed that Jack was doing a large business on a very small capital. We
                  should not wonder if the reader thinks the same. 
               
            
            
               SAVE THE MAN WITH THE RED HAIR.
               It requires great coolness and experience to steer a canoe down these rapids (the
                  Sault Ste. Marie), and a short time before our arrival, two Americans had ventured
                  to descend them without boatmen, and were, consequently, upset. As the story was reported to
                  us, one of them owed his salvation to a singular coincidence. As the accident took
                  place immediately opposite the town, many of the inhabitants were attracted to the
                  bank of the river to watch the struggles of the unfortunate men, thinking any
                  attempt at a rescue would be hopeless. Suddenly, however, a person appeared
                  rushing towards the group, frantic with excitement. "Save the man with the red
                  hair!" he vehemently shouted; and the exertions which were made in consequence of
                  his earnest appeals proved successful, and the red-haired individual in an
                  exhausted condition, was safely landed. "He owes me eighteen dollars," said his
                  rescuer, drawing a long breath, and looking approvingly on his assistants. The
                  red-haired man's friend had not a creditor at the Sault, and in default of a
                  competing claim, was allowed to pay his debt to nature. "And I'll tell you what it
                  is, stranger," said the narrator of the foregoing incident, complacently drawing a
                  moral therefrom; "a man 'ill never know how necessary he is to society if he don't
                  make his life valuable to his friends as well as to himself."
            
            
               BALL ON BOARD THE "SAM WARD."
               But the most propitious time for ingratiating oneself with our fair passengers was
                  at the evening dance, the band being composed of niggers, who officiated during
                  the day as barbers. There was one lovely girl, with a noble, thoughtful brow,
                  black hair and eyes, perfect features, and a most irresistible smile, with that
                  clear, transparent complexion which is never to be met with out of America, to
                  whom I had from the first ardently desired an opportunity of being introduced; and
                  I shall never forget the thrill of pleasure which I felt when, upon the two
                  guitars and a fiddle ranging themselves along the bottom of the saloon, and
                  striking up a lively tune, this fair creature, near whom I happened to be
                  standing, artlessly remarked, "that she had a mind to take the knots out of her
                  legs," a piece of information on her part which I interpreted to mean that I was
                  at liberty to offer my services to assist her in this proceeding; and I
                  accordingly solicited the honor of being her partner, and "annexed to her right
                  away."
               Alas! I little knew what I had undertaken, or how completely I had over-estimated
                  my own saltatory powers. Our vis-à-vis were a
                  very tall, thin, flat lady with a figure like a plank, and a short wizened old
                  man, who reached to her elbow, with grey, bushy eyebrows, which almost concealed
                  his small piercing eyes, and a huge, grizzly beard, so thick and matted, that when
                  he compressed his lips, in the energy of the dance, it was impossible to tell
                  within a quarter of an inch where his mouth was. During the moments of rest,
                  however, he twitched it with a short, jerking motion, as if he was knitting with
                  his jaws. He was buttoned up to the chin in a straight, military-looking coat; but
                  he had short, baggy trousers, dirty stockings, and his large splay feet were
                  thrust into a pair of very old pumps. The band played nigger melodies, and
                  accompanied themselves vocally. The dance was a sort of cotillon; but we were
                  entirely dependent for our figures upon the caprice of the band-leader, who
                  periodically shouted his orders. My partner and the little old man opposite
                  commenced operations. With clenched teeth and contracted brow did he give himself
                  up to the pleasures of the dance. Now he plunged violently forward, then retreated
                  with a double shuffle, then seized my partner by the waist, and whirling her
                  rapidly into the middle, danced round her demoniacally, performing the "pigeon
                  wing on de floor and de same in de ar," he pirouetted first on one leg, then on
                  the other, then jumped into the air with both, finished up with "Pete Johnson's
                  knock," and the "under cleets," and retired breathless to scowl at me and work his
                  jaws defiantly. As my turn had come I now made a dash at his partner, and
                  attempted a series of similar gymnastic exercises, in a solemn and violent way,
                  conscious all the while of the glance of profound contempt with which my fair
                  companion eyed my performances, as I energetically hopped round her tall vis-à-vis, whom I might have imagined a May-pole. But
                  not until the dance became more complicated, and the orders followed each other
                  with rapidity and distracted my attention, did I feel the full effect of my
                  rashness. The band sang, "Heigh Nelly, Ho Nelly, listen lub to me;" and then the
                  leader shouted, "Gents, to the right!" and away we all shot in the required
                  direction. Then came, "I sing for you—I play for you a dulcem melody." "Balance in
                  line!" There was a puzzle! I got into everybody's line but my own; and my partner,
                  with her sweet smile, said that "I had come near riling her, but that she was
                  almost too tired to locomote much longer;" so that we were both much relieved when
                  the last order came of, "Promenayde all to your seats;" and in a
                  state of extreme exhaustion we threw ourselves on a couch, satisfied that the
                  great end had been gained, and that no knot could have been obstinate enough to
                  resist such violent treatment.
               
               In another steamboat, one of the author's friends takes up his quarters, by
                  mistake, in the lady's cabin, one of the fair occupants of which tells him, "Guess
                  you put for the wrong pew, Mister."
            
            
               THE DOMICILE ERECTED BY JOHN.
               (Translated from the Vulgate of M. Goose.)
               Splendidly Illustrated with original cuts drawn for
                  this work by our printer's devil, little Jacky Horner, aged only five
                  years and great-grandson of the original "jack" who built the aforesaid
                  shanty.
               
                  
               
               
                  BEHOLD the Mansion reared by dædal Jack!
               
               
                  See the malt stored in many a plethoric sack,
                  In the proud cirque of Ivan's bivouac.
                  Anon, with velvet foot and Tarquin strides,
                  Subtle grimalkin to his quarry glides—
                  Grimalkin grim, that slew the fierce RODENT,
                  
                     
                  
                  Whose tooth insidious Johann's sackcloth rent!
               
               
                  
               
               
               
                  Lo! now the deep-mouthed canine foes assault,
                  That vext the avenger of the stolen malt,
                  
                     
                  
                  Stored in the hallowed precincts of that hall
                  That rose complete at Jack's creative call.
               
               
                  
               
               
                  Here stalks the impetuous cow with crumpled horn
                  Whereon the exacerbating hound was torn,
                  Who bayed the feline slaughter beast, that slew
                  The rat predacious whose keen fangs ran through
                  The textile fibres that involved the grain
                  That lay in Hans' inviolate domain.
               
               
                  Here walks the forlorn damsel, crowned with rue,
                  Lactiferous spoils from vaccine dugs who drew,
                  Of that corniculate beast whose tortuous horn
                  Tossed to the clouds, in fierce, vindictive scorn,
                  The baying hound, whose braggart bark and stir
                  Arched the lithe spine and reared the indignant fur
                  Of puss, that with verminicidal claw,
                  Struck the 
                        wierd
                        weird
                      rat, in whose insatiate maw
                  Lay reeking malt that erst in Juan's courts we saw.
               
               
                  
               
               
                  Robed in senescent garb, that seems in sooth
                  Too long a prey to Cronos' iron tooth,
                  Behold the man whose amorous lips incline,
                  Full with young Eros' osculative sign,
                  
                  To be the lorn maid whose lact-albic hands
                  Drew albu-lactic milk from lacteal glands
                  
                     
                  
                  Of that immortal bovine, by whose horn
                  
                     
                  
                  Distort, to realms ethereal was borne
                  The beast catulean, vexer of that sly
                  Ulysse quadrupedal, who made die
                  The old mordacious rat that dared devour
                  Antecedaneous ale in John's domestic bower.
               
               
                  Lo! here, with hirsute honors doffed, succinct
                  Of saponaceous locks, the priest who linked
                  In Hymen's golden bands the man unthrift,
                  Whose means exiguous stared from many a rift,
                  Even as he kissed the virgin all forlorn,
                  Who milked the cow with implicated horn,
                  Who in fierce wrath the canine torturer skied,
                  That dared to vex the incidious muricide,
                  Who let auroral effluence through the pelt
                  Of that sly rat that robbed the palace Jack built.
               
               
                  
               
               
                  The loud cantankerous Shanghai comes at last,
                  Whose shouts aroused the shorn ecclesiast
                  Who sealed the vows of Hymen's sacrament,
                  
                  To him who, robed in garments indigent,
                  Exosculates the damsel lachrymose,
                  The emulgator of the horned brute morose,
                  
                     
                  
                  That tossed the dog, that worried the cat, that kilt
                  
                  The rat, that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.
               
            
            
               MRS. PIMPERTON'S WHITEWASHING.
               Mrs. Pimperton had "laid it to heart" for years, that her door-yard fence should
                  be whitewashed, and she fairly tormented the flesh from Mr. Pimperton, clattering
                  about "that door-yard fence." The old man said "it had got so that he could dream
                  of nothing else but door-yard fences and whitewash!" Mrs. Pimperton at last found
                  a receipt for whitewash, which she cut from the "Federal Rocket and
                     Political Torpedo," made up of lime, salt, and sugar—"more permanent
                  and lustrous," according to the paper, than white-lead itself. This "added fuel to
                  her fire," and she followed Mr. Pimperton with that receipt until he was obliged,
                  in self-defence, to prepare a dose of it, and baptize about twenty rods of his
                  fence. Well, it did look beautiful, in the setting sun, on the
                  evening of its completion; and the old man really began to think that old Mrs.
                  Pimperton was something of a woman after all! Mr. and Mrs. Pimperton retired that
                  night happy.
               "La, me!" exclaimed Mrs. Pimperton, as she was putting the finishing touches to
                  the bow-knots of her nightcap-strings—"La, me! Mr. Pimperton, it didn't cost much,
                  n'other; and the old fence looks just as good as new, and shines a good deal
                  brighter than Squire Holmes's. with all his paint and ile. Don't say
                  a woman don't know nothing again, Mr. Pimperton. Women
                     do know something. Not a dollar out and our fence will last us for
                  ten years."
               Mr. Pimperton rolled over, grunted, and fell asleep. During the night Mrs.
                  Pimperton was aroused by strange noises. She shook Mr. Pimperton from his
                  slumbers. It did seem as if the very heavens had "broke loose," as Mrs. Pimperton
                  said. The herds of a thousand hills were evidently upon them.
               Mr. Pimperton arose and threw open the window. 
               
               "And there, gathered in the moonlight, marching and countermarching, and bellowing
                  forth unearthly sounds, and goring each other, really were (so Mr. Pimperton
                  thought) the "herds of a thousand hills" storming around his newly-whitewashed
                  fence.
               "Great Josiah!" he exclaimed, as he stood in his undress, staring through the
                  window, "why, Mrs. Pimperton, as true as you are a live woman, the very cattle
                  have come down to dance around my fence!"
               
               Then out of bed bounded Mrs. Pimperton; and there they were, sure
                  enough, "a ragin' around, their tails flying, their horns a-flarin'," as she
                  declared, and they had the first really jolly laugh together that they had had for
                  years. But the morning told the story. The herd had mostly disappeared. Two or
                  three persevering animals still lingered, however, and were still standing "reared
                  upon their hind legs, licking off the salt, sugar and lime upon the
                  top of the posts—the last touches of their last night's work!" "The fence," said
                  Mrs. Pimperton, in relating the circumstance, "was licked as clean as my
                  washboard!"
            
            
               PICTORIAL PASSAGES FROM THE LIFE OF THEOPHILUS SMUDGE.
               EDITED BY CIMABUE BRIGGS, ESQ.
               
                  
                  ONE fine afternoon, as I was leaving the exhibition rooms of the
                  "National Academy of Design," I encountered an old acquaintance; one Stubbs, whom
                  I had not seen for seven or eight years, and instead of an unpretending quiet air,
                  both in costume and deportment, which were his characteristics (if it could be
                  said he had any) when I last saw him, there was a jauntiness in his manner which
                  flashed about him, and played off (like electricity) at the end of a fashionable
                  cane; together with a profusion of hair, which he shook with the regality of a
                  lion, from under cover of a wide-brimmed Paris nap, an
                  amazingly broad turn-down of a shirt collar, and a small patch of manhood on the
                  nether lip, all of which more than at first half concealed him from my
                  recognition. "Bless my eyes, Smudge, I am glad to see you!" said he, grasping me
                  heartily by the hand, at the same time keeping the length of his arm stiffly
                  between us (probably that I might be able to scan his whole length, which he was
                  posing effectively); "have you anything here?"
               "I am not sufficiently confident," I answered, "to attempt exhibiting my humble
                  essays; and, though I have not seen you for so long a time, I have always looked,
                  but in vain, for your name, not only here but at other galleries. How is it?" I
                  continued; "you must have had many chances of improving yourself, besides (as I
                  have been informed) an intimacy with one or two painters of creditable
                  character."
               To these observations Stubbs replied with a series of laughs, concluding with,
                  "Smudge, you are a perfect infant! a regular innocent! So you've look'd for my
                  name, have you? that's capital!" "Surely," said I, in a voice one key above my
                  general tone, "my education has not been so strangely neglected but that I can
                  decipher the monosyllabic difficulty of your name, Mr. Stubbs? And if I"——
               "Mum!" interrupted he, glancing quickly around him, "Mum, old boy. It's now five
                  years since I made up my mind that there never could be a niche in the temple of
                  fame for Joe Stubbs. I have, therefore, changed my name."
               "Changed your name!"
               "Most assuredly," he continued, "and have thus given a chance to future
                  generations, whenever inclined to enter that said temple, to gaze at and ponder on
                  the vera effigies of yours, most sincerely, Alphonso M'Intosh
                  Montague Vernon."
               At this lofty peroration he bowed, and, taking my arm, said, "How are you engaged
                  this evening? shall I come and take a cigar with you at your lodgings? I must have
                  a chat about old times, and let you into a few moves of the new ones. I'll compare
                  Stubbs with Vernon, and illustrate the difference between the antique and the
                  modern."
               On this I eagerly gave him my card, and he instantly fixed his visit for nine that
                  night, apologizing that a peculiar engagement would detain him until that
                  hour.
               Punctually at the time named, Vernon arrived—and for a couple of hours entertained
                  me with laughable accounts of his adventures in the world of art, since we last
                  had met—alternating his stories by frequent applications to my best cognac.
               I was more than pleased with Vernon's vivacity; and seeing that his vein of
                  oratory was showing itself in stronger marks, whilst I laughed with him, could not
                  help thinking that, if I attempted to keep pace with him in imitating the
                  garniture (as he called it) of his head, it would be highly necessary to guard against making such alterations, with the
                  interior as his fast drinking would inevitably lead to.
               At length, just as he was about to withdraw his illustrious person from my humble
                  apartment, I showed him a picture which I had had the good fortune to purchase for
                  a small sum, and, having studied it well, was now willing to part with it.
               "It's very fair," said Vernon, with a patronizing kind of scrutiny; "a Spanish
                  friar?"
               "No, no," said I, interrupting him, "it's Italian, and, I have been assured, by
                  Caravaggio. The subject is St. Peter; do you not see the key in his hand?"
                  
               
               "Certainly," he continued, "certainly it is; how ridiculous of me not to see it at
                  once. I'm afraid my grog has been too strong; however, I can partly excuse myself
                  from the absence of refinement in the head: it wants dignity. You see, my boy,
                  this said Caravaggio was one of the Neapolitan school, a painter who took common
                  models without idealizing sufficiently; there is something wrong, too, about the
                  drawing of the nose. As he is, nevertheless, an esteemed master, if you desire to
                  sell it, I'll bring a friend of mine who is better acquainted with the market for
                  these sort of things than I am, a damn'd clever fellow; his name is Kidd, Mr.
                  Greyborne Kidd. I must introduce you at the first opportunity." I thanked him for
                  his kind intentions, and we parted for that night.
               
                  
               
               I became curiously puzzled, as I reflected, for several successive days after
                  Vernon's visit, upon the very extraordinary change which seven years had wrought
                  in him. The more I pondered over what I recollected of his conversation, and
                  endeavored to real the ci-devant Stubbs, and
                  place him in juxtaposition with Vernon, the greater my curiosity became to see him
                  again, and that, too, in his own domicile—the whereabouts of which his card, given
                  me at parting, indicated to be the neighborhood of Washington-Square. The next day
                  I applied my knuckles to his door. "Come in," exclaimed my grand
                     epic friend Vernon. As I entered, I saw an odd,
                  measly-looking little man, whom he introduced as his friend Mr. Kidd.
               "Mr. Theophilus Smudge—Mr. Greyborne Kidd—and I trust that, you gentlemen will
                  make such service of each other, both professionally and friendly, as to render
                  this occasion 'equally agreeable in the memory of three devoted members of a great
                  profession."
               I thanked him for his kindness and his friend for his condescension, who strangely returned the compliment
                  by requesting me "not to say anything about it," adding, that he had no doubt "we
                  should be able to make the 'deal' all right," after which he glided in a quiet and
                  humble manner about 
                     my
                     the
                   room, rubbing his hands and looking rather with his nose than his eyes,
                  at the head of St. Peter—(which I had, brought with me) during which act I had
                  leisure to observe that Mr. Greyborne Kidd was a little man—very little, in
                  feature and figure, with a sharp nose, and a wide mouth, but pursed up so closely
                  that he appeared to be striving to deceive the beholder into a belief that he had
                  no mouth at all: then his eyes, which were neither black, brown, blue, nor grey,
                  but partaking of a mixture of all those colors, were as small as so small a man's
                  eyes could well be: you, nevertheless, could not deny their piercing sharpness, as
                  they twinkled through a yellow jaundiced bordering, imparting to him the
                  appearance of a golden-eyed needle.
               "There's some stuff about my friend Smudge," said Vernon (who had already lighted
                  a cigar, and having stuck a chair between his legs, was, whilst leaning over the
                  back of it, following with his looks this queer personage from one canvas to
                  another); "there's some stuff about him—vigorous pencil—brilliant
                  color—transparent shadows—excellent at composition—he'll be amongst 'em, Sir,
                  before long—he'll be a great man—he'll make a perfect—"
               "Will he ever make ten dollars a-week," interrupted Mr. Kidd (before Vernon could
                  finish his eulogistic strain) "unless he turn his attention to
                     doctoring?" without noticing my look of surprise.
               "To doctor a picture," he continued, "is to do the ancient gaff, to make the
                  production of to-day wear the respectable and seductive garb of two centuries
                  back; and there's plenty of that sort, cooked up for the knowing ones, I promise
                  you: but I'll explain all about it upon some other occasion, when I expect the
                  pleasure of a visit from you—for the present, however, it will be enough to settle
                  upon the alteration of St. Peter, which, in my opinion, may be better effected,
                  thus—first, paint out the glory and the wards of the key in the saint's hand, then
                  put him on a red cap, and you will have a bandit on the look-out, the key being
                  converted by the alteration into a pistol—a decidedly more saleable article, and
                  one," he added "upon which you may affix a more profitable name—Salvator
                  Rosa."
               "Bravo!" said Vernon—"I told you Kidd was the boy; he's a conjuror amongst the old
                  masters, though he acknowledges to be ignorant of high art;—that's excellent," he
                  continued; "St. Peter in the character of a smuggler on the look-out."
               "I am glad that you've come, Mister," said my little genius, "as I have had to do
                  a Cuyp, and am just going to doctor it;" placing on the 
                  easel at the same time a modern picture, either an imitation or copy of that
                  master—that is, it represented two or three cows in repose on the bank of a
                  river—a distant village church on a low horizon—and a Dutch vessel nearing the
                  foreground; where, as well as the cattle above-mentioned, were some full-grown
                  burdocks and sedges, receiving their share of illumination from the glances of the
                  departing sun. "Yes, yes," he continued, "I'll now show you what more than half
                  the self-created connoisseurs are caught with—the bird-lime of the
                  picture-dealer," whereupon, having slightly oiled and wiped the young Cuyp on the
                  easel, he proceeded to rub the sky and distance over with a dingy mixture of
                  megilp, ivory black, and Naples yellow, avoiding the foreground, which he served
                  in the same way, but with bitumen in the place of the black and yellow, observing
                  to me during the process, that the doctor for the foreground would be too hot for
                  the more opaque parts of the picture (the sky and distance), whilst the
                     preparation tion for those parts
                  would be too muddy and opaque for the transparency of near objects. Having thus
                  passed evenly over the surface, he next, by a circular motion of the thumb, rubbed
                  the dirt into the interstices of the picture, producing a kind of granulated
                  texture, the apparent effect of age.
               Here the dawn of deception in the picture world first opened upon me. I was
                  astounded at the metamorphosis which in ten minutes was performed on a newly
                  painted work—a senile visage stamped, as it were instantaneously, upon the
                  unfurrowed infant. Many a picture, I exclaimed, must I have seen which could not
                  have been long from your easel, or some one equally expert, which I innocently
                  contemplated as of two centuries back.
               
                  
               
               "Ha! ha that's more than likely," said the little conjuror. "I suppose you never
                  once thought of making a calculation as to how many accredited pictures by
                  different masters there are in the various public and private collections? My
                  governor once did, and as to Cuyp alone he proved that he must have been harder
                  worked than a West India slave, to have produced a half that bear his name. Then
                  you see every purchaser hugs himself upon having one of the right sort. So soon as
                  it is in his possession it becomes his pet, and like one of his children he sees
                  it all beautiful."
            
            
               "DANDY NAT'S" COURTSHIP.
               
                  
                  DANDY NAT" was the sobriquet
                  facetiously and descriptively bestowed on Mr. Nathaniel Higgins of our village.
                  Mr. Higgins was a barber—I beg his pardon, a hairdresser; for you could hardly
                  offend the little man more seriously than by applying the former coarse term to
                  his "profession." Imaginative tailors are said to have souls above buttons. Mr.
                  Higgins had a soul above lather and shaving-cloths. It is true that his limited
                  means and the smallness of the patronage to be obtained in so humble a place as
                  "our village," forced him to handle the razor and the strop as well as the
                  scissors and the curling-irons; but he always averred that, when lathering the
                  visages of country bumpkins, and rasping off their bubbly beards, his soul was not
                  in his occupation—his thoughts were far away. I am inclined to believe him; for an
                  unlucky ploughman once averred that the romantic tonsor, while in the act of
                  shaving him, had suddenly squeezed his nose with such intense force as to make him
                  sneeze violently, thereby bringing the injured feature into such forcible contact
                  with the razor, as nearly to amputate his organ of smelling at one blow.
               
               "Pardon, pardon!" shouted the unhappy Higgins, in an agony of alarm at what he had
                  done. "Oh! I was thinking of her."
               "Thinking of her!" growled and sputtered the unfortunate plough. man,
                  holding his nose so tight to his face, that he appeared doubtful whether it would
                  not tumble off if he let go his hold; "thinking of her! well, dang it, if I'd
                  loike to be her, if that's the way you squeedges her nose."
               
                  
               
               Very different was the case when Miss Tadpole, the daughter of Squire Tadpole,
                  sent for Mr. Higgins to come to Tadpole Hall, and "do her hair" for a race-ball,
                  or a dinner at the county member's. Then, indeed, the hair-dresser's whole heart
                  was in his task; he gave the reins to his imagination; but it was only to bring
                  its workings to bear upon the subject of his duties; only that his genius might
                  devise some new and artistic grouping of the side curls, some
                  never-before-attempted fold of the top-knot of the "bell chevreloor" (as he termed
                  it) of the carroty-headed Miss Wilhelmina Tadpole.
               It will be naturally inferred from the sobriquet
                  bestowed on our friend, that he was very careful of his personal appearance, and
                  such was the case. Not only were his own hair and whiskers brushed, oiled, curled,
                  and arranged with a precision and an eye to effect, that rendered them living and
                  moving evidences of his professional skill, but in every portion of his dress he
                  was no less particular. When, doffing the tonsorial apron, he prepared to sally
                  forth for a walk in our village, he might be seen arrayed in brilliant nankeen
                  "unmentionables," violet sprig-pattern waistcoat, and coat of bright bottle-green,
                  with brass buttons; a white hat, Berlin gloves, variegated neckcloth (crimson the
                  predominating color), and shoes with the largest of ties of the broadest of
                  riband. The hat was worn slightly on one side; and in his hand was flourished a
                  cane of slender dimensions, surmounted by an "albata" top, representing the head
                  of an animal, supposed, by charitable zoologists, to be meant for a fox. His
                  person was not by any means commanding, though Nat himself believed it to be
                  graceful; neither was his face, judged by ordinary standards, handsome; indeed, it
                  was so extremely puny-looking, that it seemed as though all the vital energy of
                  his body had been exhausted on his hair.
               In our village there also resided a young seamstress, who, by her own labor,
                  supported herself and her bed-ridden mother. She was a remarkably pretty girl,
                  with a merry voice, a laughing eye, and one of those brilliant complexions which
                  defy the evil influences of hard work and close confinement in-doors. Many were
                  the admirers and lovers of pretty Mary Jenkins. But either Mary was too fastidious
                  in her tastes, or too cold-hearted to care for the swains who said they were dying
                  for her. At all events, not one among them could boast of any marks of her
                  preference; and one or two who had been bold enough to "pop the question" had met
                  with decided refusals; though they confessed, that it had been done with such
                  consideration for their feelings by Mary, that they loved her better than ever,
                  after they had ceased to hope that she would smile on their suit.
               Mr. Nathaniel Higgins was decidedly sentimental. Therefore, as a matter of course,
                  he imagined himself very desperately in love with the fascinating Mary. Like
                  sentimental young gentlemen of all classes, no sooner did the idea of his being
                  the victim of the tender passion seize him, than be began to write poetry. It is a
                  singular fact, that sentimental men
                  always fancy that bad verses have a greater effect than good prose on the female
                  mind; consequently, Mr. Higgins having finished off five or six "shavings" one
                  morning, sat himself down with a steel pen, a penny bottle of ink, and a clean
                  sheet of note-paper, and determined "to give vent to his feelings," as he said, in
                  poetry. And here, we may remark, that it has always struck us that it must be
                  exceedingly annoying to a gentleman of a romantic turn of mind seeking to express
                  his "burning thoughts" in verse, to be constantly brought to a "pull-up" for want
                  of a rhyme. Perhaps it is our own want of poetical inspiration that has put this
                  very prosaic idea into our head. Certainly, we did once attempt to perpetrate an
                  amatory effusion in verse, but when we sought for a rhyme to "Cupid," the only one
                  we could hit on was "stupid." It looked ominous; so we refrained, and have stuck
                  to prose ever since. But we are digressing.
               After four hours' intense labor, our friend Nat had produced the following
                  offspring of his brain:—
               
                  Lovely girl, you've won my heart:
                  Oh, if you only knew the smart
                  Which you've given to that part!
                  Dare I tell you all I feel?
                  Dare I on the hearth-rug kneel
                  At your feet, and tell you then
                  I'm the wretchedest of men
                  If you will not deign to bless
                  Him that is in such distress?
               
               
                  Beauteous Mary! hear me swear
                  By that lovely head of hair.
                  Which these fingers dress'd one day
                  For the ball on first of May,
                  How I love you, on the whole,
                  Better than my heart and soul.
                  If you'll only deign to give
                  One small smile, I'll happy live.
                  But, if you reject my prayer,
                  Mary, not another hair
                  Shall these wretched fingers dress—
                  I'll die! but love you none the less!"
               
               How many sheets of paper the poet spoiled in coping out this beautiful production
                  of his genius is not recorded, but it is to be feared that their cost equalled the
                  proceeds of several "shaves," "cuttings," "curlings," and "dressings." At length,
                  however, the feat was accomplished; and although one or two "h's" got blotted in
                  the bows, and one or two "y's" kicked their neighbors in an unpleasant manner, Mr.
                  Higgins was altogether proud of his 
                     caligraphy
                     calligraphy
                  .
               Folding the note carefully, and sticking it into the pocket of the sprig-pattern
                  waistcoat, after an elaborate toilet, "Dandy Nat" sallied forth to visit the fair
                  milliner.
               Bolder men than Nathaniel Higgins have felt something very like trepidation when
                  approaching the habitation where "dwells the lady of their love"—at all events,
                  before the delicate question has been asked and answered in the affirmative. It
                  will readily be believed, therefore, that the hairdresser's legs shook under him
                  in the most absurd style; and his hand trembled so violently as he laid hold of
                  the little brass knocker of Mrs. Jenkins' door, that the rap he gave was almost
                  involuntary, and sent forth a little quivering sound, as if the head of the
                  knocker was having a quiet laugh at his agitated appearance.
               
                  
               
               Mary herself opened the door, and with a smiling and blushing countenance begged
                  the visitor to enter. Nat stammered out something thing intended for a greeting, and followed her
                  into the parlor, treading on the tail of a slumbering cat, which forthwith struck
                  her claws into his nankeens.
               "Nice day, miss," said Nat, bolting out the words.
               "Do you really think so, Mr. Higgins? I'm afraid it's raining a little."
               Poor Nat had made a bad shot, so he was obliged to say he rather liked rain than
                  otherwise.
               There was a long pause, after which Mary inquired, "Are you going to the dance
                  next Monday, Mr. Higgins?"
               "Oh yes, certainly," replied Nat, very quickly; and then, suddenly checking
                  himself, "that is—no—at least, I'm not certain. It depends on one thing—"Here he
                  stammered and looked so queer that Miss Jenkins inquired if he was ill.
               "Oh no! That is—yes—not exactly—but here, you see—" stuttered the
                  little man, laying his hand on his waistcoat.
               "A pain in the chest?" said Mary, quite unconscious. "Colds are so very much
                  about. Have you ever tried those new wafers that Mr. Drugs sells?"
               "N-o-o-o," said poor Nat; "not exactly. You see it's not that; it's
                  not a bodily illness——" And here he put on such a diabolical leer
                  that Mary could scarcely tell whether to laugh or scream. She certainly thought he
                  was mad.
               "Pray, Mr. Higgins, excuse me," she said, "but I really must go to poor mamma."
                  And she rose to depart.
               "Oh, yes—exactly so—good-by!—stay, Miss Jenkins!" He fumbled in his
                  waistcoat-pocket, thrust a piece of paper into her hands, saying, "Read
                     that," with a half despairing look, and rushed out of the house, nearly
                  breaking his neck over the sleepy cat, who, however, had no time to stick her
                  claws against his nankeens before he escaped.
               In an agony of mind, "Dandy Nat" rushed back to his own shop. He was dreadfully
                  afraid that he had not made a favorable impression. He began to wonder why he had
                  not said half a hundred fine things that seemed to come so naturally into his head
                  now. He tried to recollect what he had said; but he could recollect
                  nothing, except that his leg was still sore from the indentation of the cat's
                  claws.
               "Confound the cat!" he muttered. "It was she that put everything out of my head.
                  Well, never mind; if that girl has a heart, I don't think she'll resist those
                  verses."
               With this gratifying reflection he consoled himself, and fell into a fit of
                  musing, which lasted half-an-hour. He was then aroused by a boy knocking at his
                  door, and, on opening it, a letter was thrust into his hand. "From Miss Jenkins,"
                  the urchin said, "and no answer."
               With trembling hands he seized the sweet missive, and, bolting his door, broke the
                  seal and opened it. An inclosure fell to the ground; but before stooping to pick
                  it up, he read the note, which was in her handwriting, as follows:—
               "Miss Jenkins's compliments to Mr. Higgins, and returns him the paper he left with
                  Miss J. She cannot understand what Mr. Higgins could mean in giving the note to
                  her, as it cannot possibly be any affair of hers. If Mr. Higgins means that he is
                  in want of a small loan, no doubt her mamma will be happy to supply Mr. Higgins;
                  but he really should apply in a less extraordinary manner."
               A horrid doubt seized poor Higgins as he read this letter. He thrust his hand into
                  his waistcoat-pocket. The verses were still there! He picked up the
                  inclosure which had fallen from Mary's note. Alas! it was a dunning epistle from
                  the laundress that washed and did for him.

               The unhappy Nat never moved for half-an-hour after this horrid catastrophe. His
                  first sane action was to rush off to the nearest railway station and book himself
                  for London. He has never visited "our village" since that day; but to his honor be
                  it said, though he always vows that "mare jones" blighted the hopes of his heart,
                  he did settle accounts with his laundress.
               
                  
               
               THE END OF THIS MOVING TALE.
            
            
               
               OLD ZEB. BEESWING'S EXPERIENCE AT A CRACK HOTEL.
               ZEB. BEESWING was as hard looking an old nut as you'd find on a twelve hours'
                  travel. The first time I saw him he was sitting on a mule, meek as Moses, dressed
                  in an old, dark, brown-soap-colored blanket-coat, originally white, an old
                  battered, broad-brim, low crown, black felt hat, old cottonade breeches, of an
                  invisible blue color, and a very square pair of old russet shoes. His face—well! I
                  don't believe I can do it justice. However, if you'll take a hickory nut, one that
                  age has turned a dark-brown shade, leave the sharp end for a nose, drill two holes
                  each side of it, and put in black glass beads for eyes, cut a long slit from right
                  under the nose to the corner of the left eye, for a mouth—perhaps you can approach
                  it. The cords of his neck were loose, for which cause, possibly, his head hung
                  down. When you spoke to him he'd slowly turn his head round sideways, shutting his
                  right eye—if you were on that side of him—till he could see you with his left eye,
                  and then he'd open on you.
               Wishing to reach the landing at St. Joseph's in time to take the morning boat down
                  the Mississippi for New Orleans, I had pushed my horse pretty well until I came
                  within sight of the river. The mist rising as the sun came up I saw the boat was
                  not yet in sight, and so held in and walked my horse. Turning a corner of the
                  road, I met Zeb. looking as I have described and riding the same old mule. As I
                  came up to him he slowly twisted his head round, until, seeing who it was, he
                  drawled out:—
               "Mornin' Squar. How d'ye do, this mornin'?"
               "Right well, Zeb. What brings you out so early, before the fog's off?"
               "Cottin, cottin, cottin, ollaways cottin, in course! Sent a load down t'other day
                  to landin', heerd last night it haddent been shipt. Am gwine thar now to give
                  somebody hell." And he gave himself, at this moment, some tobacco, first thrusting
                  one hand down, down, in the pocket of that old blanket coat till his whole arm
                  disappeared, and when he drew it up again bringing up a chunk of honey-dew, as big
                  as "a hymn-book!" to use his own expression.
               "On-ly twist me into a b'y agin, an' I reckon"—here was a pause, occasioned by the
                  honey-dew—"I'd ractify thengs. Squar 'em up. You're young, you can ractify for
                  me."
               "Certainly! What can I do for you?"
               "Yew kno' Dewberry, Frenchman in P'ydras street down in Orleans City? Keeps licker
                  oil kinds. I'm sore f'r about ten gallins of his best con-yag bran'ny. Got kinder
                  racked down on whiskey, an' want a change of feed. Tell him ter drive it up by
                  next boat; ef he dis-ap-pints me, he and me will have the severest kind of a
                  battil nex' occasion we meet." I promised to call and give his order, and then
                  asked him why he didn't visit the city occasionally; mentioning to him that I had
                  heard he had never been down the river but once in his life.
               "True as trooth! Never was thar bot one occasion, never go agin'. Crack hotels!
                  Hell!"
               "What's the matter with the crack hotels?"
               "Cracks are the matter with 'em. Cracks more'n siventy foot deep. Oh yes, I've
                  been thro' 'em, from top to bottom!"
               "How?"
               "Yew lissen!"—here the honey-dew caused a cessation of words for a second—"Some
                  yares agone I travelled to the city for the fust time, an' mebbe I hadn't a few
                  thengs to larn. I 'rived thar of a mornin', went strate to my marchant, drew on
                  him, and then streaked for a fust-class ho-tel—mind ye a crack ho-tel. The ho-tel
                  was filled. Spring races, and all that sort of theng on, an' they lo-cated me up
                  in the top loft. I proposed to work on thair feelin's, sayin' I was a ole man,
                  week and fee-bull in the jints like, an' couldn't mount them air stairs.
                  'Twouldn't jerk. Had to stan' it. In the afternoon jined forces, with a onsightly
                  fast crowd of ole b'ys, an' the way they made things cirkoolate was 'stoundin'.
                  Tore up everything as was to be seen, by the roots. We did! Drunk more licker nor
                  one could bottel in a yare, and then—wal, I've a faint-ish i-dea 'bout bein'
                  toted, t'ord mornin', up very high, over one story and then 'nother, feelin' orful
                  mizzable 'bout the boddy ginerally, incloodin' my hed. Rek'lect concloodin' to git
                  a leetle more licker, to cure me, gittin' out of my room, losing my way in a
                  entry; end of all, gittin' to wot I s'posed to be my room, and layin' right down
                  in bed an' goin' to sleep.
               "All of a suddin I started up out of a soun' sleep, the room was as dark as black
                  nite, an' thar was the mos' tearin' and poundin' soun' a ringin' in my ears, like
                  ef they wur tryin' to bile down a thousan' thunder-claps inter one. All at once I
                  feel the floor a sinkin' an' givin' way unner me. 'Way I went, fallin', fallin',
                  the nise bein' added all the time; such a screamin', shriekin', yellin',
                  thunderin', roarin' row! Knew I was on the road to fire an' brimstone when I
                  started; sech kind uv low-com-motion ain't pious—goin' down hill faster an'
                  faster, till I was brought up with a roun' jerk an' pitched right inter the black
                  hole. Jus' as I 'spected! Thar wos all the fires a burnin', an' nigger devils busy, brilin', roastin',

                  like fried eggs an' bacon an' may I never chaw honey-dew more ef I didn't scent

                  up rushes a big devil, dressed in white, and pre-pares ter haul away at the clothe
                  I was wrapped up in. Sez I, 'Hallo!'" 
               
               "Sez he, 'The, devil! Air you here?'"
               "Come at last!" sez I. "Don't be hard now, on a poor ole man. Draw it easy. I
                  always lived pieously on airth."
               "Wotr yer doin' here?" sez he.
               "I'm sure I dun know," sez I.
               "Clar out then!" say he, "thar's the door!" 'Twant quite clare in my mind whether
                  'twas the quarters for bad sperits or no, but I ashore you I didnt need no second
                  invie to make myself scarce 'bout thar! I made a rush for the door like ef old
                  Sauglier's blood hounds were after me an' would you believe it! the next minit I
                  was in the bar-room of the i-dentical ho-tel I put up to when I come to the city.

                     crack hotel, an' I fell through the crack. Whar I

               JUVENILE ART-TREASURES.
               PRIVATE VIEW.
               
                  
                  FOLLOWING the lead of the Manchester Art people, a committee of
                  young gentlemen has recently been formed, with the view of getting up an
                  Exhibition of all the Juvenile Art-Treasures they can anyhow lay their hands on.
                  It is intended to confine the specimens exhibited to the very early works of our
                  exceedingly young masters; and any master who exceeds the age of ten will be
                  esteemed too ancient to have his works exhibited. The object, which the
                  Art-Committee will keep steadily before them, is to show the progress of the Arts
                  from the earliest infancy, and it is confidently hoped that specimens may reach
                  them even from the cradle. Of the works which have already been entrusted to their
                  care, we have been courteously invited to a private view, and we have our own
                  permission to make public the results of our inspection.
               No oil-paintings as yet have been received by the Committee, and indeed the only
                  bit of canvas in their hand's is a piece used as the ground of an unfinished work
                  in worsted, on which the outline of a
                  kettle has been traced in marking-ink. This has been sent in by a young
                  Welsh master, MASTER JONES; and having been achieved at the age of not
                  quite three, may be viewed as a specimen of his very early period. Several
                  water-color sketches have, however, come to hand, one or two of which are quite
                     chefs-d'œuvre in their way, and are prized by
                  the mammas of the young masters who have painted them as being early sweepings of
                  the brush of genius. Some of these, we note, are somewhat smudgy in their tone,
                  and must perhaps be viewed as being rather after rubbings than they can be after
                  RUBENS; still, upon the whole, the color-boxes have been used with singular
                  effect, and, for first attempts, the landscapes are perhaps not more completely
                  unlike nature than is usually the case. MASTER SMITH'S in this way are especially
                  unique, and may be fairly viewed as JEM'S—that being the christian name of this
                  now rising-six young artist.
               Although the colorists appear in tolerable force, we are not surprised,
                  of course, to find their works are far outnumbered by the drawings in
                  plain pencil which already have arrived. When properly arranged and classified in
                  order, we think that this compartment will perhaps be the attraction
                  of the whole Art-Exhibition. Both the pencil schools, in fact, will be completely
                  represented—both the Lead school and the Slate. There are some portraits in the
                  former style which must have not a little startled those who sat for them, so far
                  from being human are the features represented. With the slate-pencilists, however,
                  there is a greater tendency to landscape than to drawing from the life. Several of
                  their subjects are indeed architectural, but their houses, for the most part, are
                  merely sketched in outline. Their landscapes are, however, works of more
                  pretension, and even animals are introduced in some of them with the happiest
                  effect. There may be doubts in some cases what creatures are intended (as for
                  instance in young MASTER BROWNE'S "A Landscape with Cows," where
                  the tails are so handled as to look like fifth legs), but in general the device of
                  the scroll has been resorted to, and the words "This is a Horse!" prevent one's
                  guessing that a pig must be the animal depicted.
               With the sole exception of some ornamented book-covers (many of them so injured as
                  to be quite past repairing) no specimens of Ornamental Art have been as yet
                  contributed. A few carvings have arrived, of cherry-stones and hockey-sticks; and
                  some spoons, bit nearly through, and otherwise embossed, will be sure to claim
                  attention as choice specimens of metal work. To connoisseurs in chicken bone a
                  highly-decorated skipjack, from MASTER GREEN'S collection, will doubtless be an
                  object of considerable interest; while those who have a taste for Sculpture can
                  hardly fail to be delighted with the ROBINSON Marbles, which, in the estimation of
                  their owner, are not second to the ELGIN ones. They will be found to contain
                  specimens of both the antique styles, the plain style and the colored: as they
                  comprise a goodly show of Alley Tors as well as Commoners.
               The Armory Compartment will be very rich in specimens. Several of the fly-guns
                  will be found most delicately finished, and well worthy of inspection; and
                  although the pop-guns show less polish, and perhaps more hasty workmanship, still,
                  their elegant simplicity is in itself a beauty. The pea-shooters and pin-darts are
                  also very choice, and some  of the toy-cannon will be viewed as highly
                  interesting specimens of early English ordnance. But perhaps the gem of this
                  compartment is a suit of pasteboard armor, lately manufactured for some nursery
                  theatricals. This will be found to repay the closest study, being exquisitely
                  finished, and complete in every detail, down to the lath dagger and the paste and
                  paper battle-axe.
            
            
               
               DEACON HEZEKIAH.
               
                  O, HEZEKIAH is a pious soul!
                  With his phiz as long as a hickory pole,
                  And he wouldn't smile if you'd give him the whole
                  Of the gold in California;
                  There he is, like a cloud, in his Sunday pew
                  With his book in his hand, in his long-tailed blue,
                  And you'd better take care or he'll look you through,
                  With a glance that says, "I scorn you."
               
               
                  He is very strait, and narrow, and tall,
                  From the crown to the hem of his over-all;
                  And he sings the psalm with a woful brawl,
                  And a mouth like a clam's when it's crying;
                  But when Monday comes he is up with the sun,
                  His religion is over, his work begun,
                  And you'd think that there wasn't a world but one,
                  And he hadn't a thought of dying.
               
               
                  You would think he was sorry he'd lost a day,
                  As he rushes and rattles and drives away,
                  As he gives the poor orphan a crusty "nay,"
                  And the widow a vinegar greeting;
                  And he bargains, and sells, and collects his rent,
                  Nor tears nor petitions can make him relent,
                  Till he gets in his pocket each doubtful cent,
                  Though he wouldn't be seen acheating!
               
               
                  And Tuesday, and Wednesday, and all the week,
                  He doesn't know Gentile, nor Jew, nor Greek,
                  Nor care whom he robs of the last beef-steak,
                  Nor the last poor hope of fire; 
                  But Hezekiah is pious, very!
                  For who in the world ever saw him merry?
                  And he looks as forlorn as a dromedary,
                  And his voice, of itself, is a choir.
               
            
            
               "BEWARE OF THE WIDDERS."
               
                  
               
               TALKIN' o' widders, Mr. Spades, they're slippery characters; and wunst they git
                  thar thumbs on a young man, by gosh he's clean gone! I know this by experience,
                  pretty much—and I've had a good deal o' that sort o' teachin'. I was lucky,
                  though, for once, and got outen her clapper-claws jist in time. Got a
                  piece terbacker, Mr. Spades Thank-ee.
               You see, I was a young feller, 'bout twenty, or thereabout, and jis begun to feel
                  my beard 'gin to grow, when I tuck it into my head I must get married, and be
                  hanged to me. (Git up!) Well, I was driving then on the old Ramville road, and
                  'bout ten mile an' better fore you git thar, lived the widder Taylor. She had two
                  children, was about twenty-five, an' pore as Job's turkey hen. I didn't mind that.
                  Her whole sittywation in life didn't matter much to me. I felt powerful ful smart, an' was goin' to git a wife.
                  Golly, what a mouthful that word "wife" is in the teeth of a fool 'bout twenty yer
                  old! Well, I sot in to courtin', and she sorter shied off, I thought, but had an
                  idea she was drawin' me on. I used to stop every day when I didn't hev passengers;
                  and when I did, I'd ride back and see her at night. She wouldn't never let me kiss
                  her, lessen she wanted sumpen from town by me; and then, three times outen four,
                  she didn't give me the money to git that sumpen with. I didn't keer, she kissed
                  me; and I'd hardly take a chaw terbacker, fear 'twould take the taste ouffen my
                  lips. (Git up!) Well, I don't wanter be all day tellin' o' the story; but arter
                  sayin' pirty things, and spendin' more than my month's wages, I 'gun to think I
                  might as well bring things to a pint. Thinks I, Peace, to-morrow you must ax her
                  'bout it. When to-morrow cum, course there was a big load o' passengers, and
                  course they was in a hurry, an' I couldn't stop. That night I rid ten miles thro'
                  the rain to see her.
               "My lor," sez she, "what brot you here, Mr. Peace?"
               "Cum to see you, my darlin'!" sez I.
               "Aw, hush!" sez she; "you're always so funny, Mr. Peace."
               Sez I—"My love, you look mity purty to-night; won't you marry me 'bout
                  Christmas?"
               "Law! Mr. Peace, how you talk! Why, I can't think o' sich a thing."
               "Cum, cum," sez I, "none o' yer gammon; come up to yer fodder, my pirty, an' say
                  'Y-a-s,' rite sweet."
               Geeminy! I was a fool, gentlemen. (Git up!)
               Sez she—"This hyars gone fur enuf. I'm in yarnest, and tho' I think a heep of yer,
                  I can't think of marryin' yer."
               I was kerflummixed, and didn't know no more'n a fool wot to say. I an' she was
                  settin on a chist, an' I sorter hilt down my head to think an' she begun to cher
                  me up. I groaned and she talked, and toreckly I drapped off'n the chist full
                  length on the floor, groanin' powerful. As I fell, I kicked over the table with
                  the candle on it, leavin' us in the dark.
               "Wot's the matter, Mr. Peace; are you sick?"
               "No; I aint sick."
               "Wot's the matter, then? Do tell me, Mr. Peace."
               I groaned, and rolled, and wallered roun', she keepin' a coaxin' of me to say what
                  was the matter.
               "Do git up, Mr. Peace; you'll get your clothes all siled."
               "Don't keer," says I, an' I groaned and rolled wuss an ever, and then stopped.
               "Where are you, Mr. Peace? Say, you ain't a dyin', are you?"
               By this time I heerd her down on her hands and knees, feelin' for me.
               Sez she—"Mr. Peace, ef you don't speak, I'll holler for a light and help."
               "That won't do," thinks I, an' I groans again, and hyar she cum on all fours
                  towards me. I was onderneath the bedside, and jist as she got in reach, I grabbed
                  her by the hands.
               "Let go, Mr. Peace, or I'll holler."
               "Yaas, do," sez I, "an' wot'll people say? I ain't gwine to let go 'tell you say
                  you'll hev me. I'll lay an' groan, and roll, and hold you tell mornin', ef you
                  don't."
               "Now, gentlemen, that was keen as a brier for a fellar only twenty yer old, wan't
                  it?" We assented, and he proceeded.
               Well, a'ter so long a time, she cum tu terms, an' sed she'd try an' accommodate
                  me, and told me to git up. Up I riz, and smacked her purty lips, an' rid back to
                  Ramville. Golly! I was the biggest man thar nex morning, an' tole all my frens to
                  git ready for a big splurge, 'Twas common talk, and everybody believed it;
                     but—I didn't marry the widder Taylor! "Why?" we both asked in a
                  breath. Well, you see, few days a'ter that night, she cum out to the stage to ax
                  me to bring her some wine—that she wan't zactly well. Certingly, sez I; an' that
                  night I went to the drug-shop and tole the long-legged, lank-sided, hatchet-faced
                  whelp of a clerk that I wanted sum wine. "Wot kind?" sez he. "The best you got."
                  Sez he, we have several wine; white, Maderia, and sum other names he give, (an' he
                  didn't have half of 'em), but toreckly he grinned, and sed antimonial wine.
                  "Matrimonial wine," sez I—I had pick'd up the manin' of that word, and sez I,
                  that's just what I want; fill that flask. "It's very dear," "Dod rot yer, charge
                  it to Keen & Co. (they was my bosses), they're good for it, ain't they?" He
                  grinned again, and I wanted to punch his darned tow-hed like thunder. I give it to
                  my widder that nite, and looked daggers at the fellow that was settin' talkin' to
                  her. I know'd he boarded thar, but he was in my way, and I wanted to let him know
                  it. Sez I—"Take some of it now, my dear." Then Jones looked at me, right sassy
                  like. She sorter blushed, and poured out sum and drank it off, makin' a nasty face
                  at it that riled me. Sez I, it's best in Ramsville, and cost a thunderin' site o'
                  money to git. I didn't hev time to say much more when out she bolted on the
                  gallery, and—a—well, I felt disgusted at her ignorance. Jones run out a'ter her,
                  an' I sot still—mad like. Toreckly back he cum, and sez he, wots that you gave my
                  wife?" I gave Widder Taylor some matrimonial wine, and she doesno wat's good, an's gone and
                  heaved it up. I wish she was your wife, your plenty good 'nuff for her; but let me
                  caution you not to call her your wife, an I've got sumpen to say thar, and you
                  might git hurt." Sez he, bristlin' up—"I married Widder Taylor this mornin', an'
                  she's my wife, an you've ben givin' her pison, I believe, to kill her. Now git
                  outer here?" Well, gentlemen, I was so taken back by what he sed, that he jist
                  kicked me right outer the house, my disgust for him and her both bein' too grate
                  to notice him, or resentify the kickin'. Wasn't I lucky in gettin' rid of her?
                  Didn't I manage well? Thar's Columby jist ahead. Git up.
            
            
               
                  
               
               HIGH TRAGEDY,
               IN THE ATTIC STYLE.
               (He's giving rains to his imagination.)
               DRAMATIC REMINISCENCES.
               THE Chapman family, consisting of old Chapman, William, George, Caroline, Harry
                  and Therese Chapman, some years since established and carried into operation on
                  the Western waters a "floating theatre."' concerning which so many anecdotes are
                  told. The family were all extremely fond of fishing, and during the "waits" the
                  actors amused themselves by "dropping a line" over the stern of the ark. On one
                  occasion, while playing the "Stranger," act IV., scene 1st. there was a long stage
                  wait for Francis, the servant of the misanthropic Count Walbourgh.
               "Francis! Francis!" called the Stranger.
               No reply.
               "Francis! Francis!" [A pause.] "Francis!" rather angrily called the Stranger
                  again.
               A very distant voice; "Coming, sir!" A considerable pause, during which the
                  Stranger walks up and down à la Macready, in a
                  great rage.
               "Francis!"
               Francis entering: "Here I am, sir."
               Stranger: "Why did you not come when I called?"
               Francis: "Why, the fact is, sir, I was just hauling in one of the d—dest biggest
                  catfish you ever saw."
               It was some minutes before the laughter of the audience could be restrained
                  sufficiently to allow the play to proceed.
               On another occasion, while lying at Natchez, the performance being the play of
                  "Pizarro," Rolla, in the last act, after seizing the child, and as
                  he was rushing up towards the bridge, observed a tall negro holding a tea-cup full
                  of blood (rose pink), which was wanted almost immediately on the other side of the
                  stage. As he passed he said to the negro:
               "Here, boy, carry that blood round to me on the other side; I want it the moment I
                  cross the bridge."
               Away dashed Rolla, bearing the child aloft, amidst a volley of
                  Spanish musketry, and turning to cut away the bridge with his sword, what was his
                  horror to see the tall negro walk deliberately upon the stage between the
                  "waters," and in full sight of the audience, holding the cup in one hand, and
                  stirring up the contents with the fore-finger on the other, and hear him
                  exclaim:
               "Heah, Massa Smith, here's your blood."
               The effect upon the audience can be better imagined than described, and the drop
                  was immediately lowered to shut in the ludicrous scene.
               When Cooper (we think it was) was playing at one of the Northern theatres, years
                  ago (if it wasn't Cooper, it was somebody else), he had just made his exit at the
                  entrance to the chamber of "the sleeping Duncan," when he called to the prompter, "Give me the blood! the blood!"
                  meaning the pigment wherewith he was to smear the daggers, and give himself those
                  "hangman's, hands!"
               The prompter trembled, grew pale, and stammered out, "I forgot the blood! there's
                  none in the house!"
               What was to be done? Blood must be had of some kind, or what would become of the
                  scene between Macbeth and the lady, that was to follow. The time was wasting, was
                  wasted, was spent: the stage was waiting.
               The actor, at his wit's end, suddenly seizing the delinquent prompter by the hair,
                  drew back and placed a plumper upon his nose, drawing "the claret" in a perfect
                  cataract.
               As he was incarnadining his hands and the daggers, Cooper looked savagely at the
                  poor prompter, and suggested that hereafter, he would probably be better provided
                  with his "properties."
               And this, probably, was the first and only time that that scene was played with
                     real blood.
            
            
               CLEAN SOUP—SCENE IN A HOTEL.
               DINING-ROOM. Yankee at the table commencing with soup.
               
                  YANKEE.
                  I sa-ay, waiter! This 'ere seup aint so clean as I have seen!
               
               
                  COCKNEY WAITER.
                  Sir, I don't know wot you mean by that insinnervation. I must speak to Mr.
                     Carvinknife about that.
               
               Waiter runs to head waiter, and brings that officer to Yankee's chair.
               
                  HEAD WAITER.
                  Beg pardon, sir. Did you have the honor to make a remark respecting the
                     soup?
               
               
                  HEAD WAITER
                  (looking red in the face).
                  Sir, shall I have the pleasure of saying to the Superintendent, that you
                     remarked that the soup is dirty?
               
               
                  YANKEE
                  (throwing himself back in the chair).
                  Look here, yew can report to the Sewperintendent, ef yo've got such an officer
                     over yer—I s'posed they had Sewperintendents in Sunday schools, but I never
                     heard of one in a tavern before—you can jest say to him what I said to that
                     linen-jacket fellow there. Tell the Sewperintendent what I said, but don't yer
                     lie.
               
               
                  SUPERINTENDENT
                  (coming forward).
                  Anything wrong, Thomas? Anything wrong, sir?
               
               
                  WAITER.
                  He says the soup aint clean, please, sir?
               
               
                  YANKEE.
                  That's a teetotal lie. I didn't say it was dirty—I didn't  say it
                     warn't clean. I shouldn't have said anything about yer soup at all, ef that
                     linen-jacket fellow hadn't poked a bill for the dinner in my face afore I began
                     ter eat. I shan't pay in advance. He had mor'n forty things charged in it—mor'n
                     I could eat in tew fortnights. Had a lot of wine charged, when I belonged to
                     the Sons of Temperance. What I hev, I'll pay for when the work's done. This
                     here was recommended to me fer a fus rate tavern.
               
               
                  SUPERINTENDENT.
                  My dear sir, that was only our bill of fare, designed simply to indicate what
                     dishes may be called for. Our prices for dinner are uniform.
               
               
                  YANKEE.
                  The deuce it is; well the fact is I didn't mean anything agin yer soup; what I
                     was agoin to say was this; that the soup wasn't so clean as I had seen; for yer
                     see, when I was a travellin' in Pennsylvany, they had some seup at one tavern
                     so clean, that ef yer should dip a white cambric 'andkerchief into it,
                     'twouldn't grease it.
               
               Exit Superintendent and "linen jacket fellers," amid great laughter from the
                  company.

                  HENRY GREEN was brought in for having been inebriated and asleep in
                  the highway. He had been having an evening's Amusement, in the course of which he
                  had been to the circus and afterward to a bowling alley and shooting gallery with
                  a friend whom he had picked up. By the kind permission of the Judge he was allowed
                  to tell his story in his own way, which he did in a very disjointed style, and
                  with a great deal of earnestness and volubility, somewhat after the fashion of
                  the-well-known Alfred Jingle.
               "My name is Green, Mr. Judge; live in the country; come down here for the first
                  time to see the city; stop at Mr. Astor's tavern in Broadway street; fine place;
                  good bartender, big whiskers, does things with a kind of flourishy jerk peculiar
                  to himself; didn't know anybody in the city; perfect stranger; got my supper; went
                  out on the steps; man came along—good-looking man, shiny hat, big chain, stand-up
                  collar, cane with a jack-knife in; introduced himself; said he was a stranger too;
                  wanted me to go with him and pass a pleasant evening; agreed to go; went; took
                  something to drink before we started; got a little ways and he said hadn't we
                  better take a nip; took a nip; he said shouldn't we go to the circus; told him
                  wasn't acquainted with circus, but trot it out; he said hadn't we better have
                  something first; had something; got to the door; my friend had left his pocketbook
                  at home, borrowed ten dollars and paid for two; gave me the chance, a one dollar
                  bill, three pewter dimes and a smooth cent; didn't understand York currency, but
                  thought it all right; got inside; place near the door with bottles in, also
                  glasses and pumps—large assortment of pumps with mahogany handles; friend said,
                  "Should we smile?" We smiled; stepped along and looked at the performance; men
                  with nothing on but a crown and a pair of tight breeches covered with sixpences,
                  and women with petticoats about as long as a turnover collar, all standing on one
                  leg on horseback, except when they were rolling heels over head in the sawdust
                  trying to catch the tips of their toes in their teeth; remarkable fact, all the
                  horses had two tails, and all the men were double headers; friend said it was the
                  effect of the last smile, and proposed that we should take something to get the
                  dust out of our eyes—got something to take the dust out of our eyes—friend said if
                  I'd seen enough we'd go—took a last look. 
                     AT AN ELEPHANT NOT ALTOGETHER "UP TO TRAP."
                   The men in the sixpenny breeches were dancing with the ladies in the
                  short skirts, which seemed all upside down like a bowl—man with a whip was
                  cracking it at everybody, especially a fellow with three-cornered patches all over
                  him, who was standing on his head on a pewter platter on top of a pair of
                  stilts—stopped at the place with the bottles in—friend said should we imbibe—we
                  imbibed—went outside, started to go across the street, brought up against oyster
                  cart, tried to kick over oyster-cart, got my leg between the wheels—new hat fell
                  off, couldn't get up, concluded to sit down—did sit down in my hat—friend helped
                  me up and tied my hat on with a string—-friend said shouldn't we take a
                  snifter—took a snifter—went to a shooting place—tried to kill the cast-iron man
                  with the pipe in his mouth—don't think I did, fired seven times and all the balls
                  lodged in the ceiling overhead, except one which went through the toe of my boot
                  and stuck in the floor; friend said,
                  hadn't we better horn—horned; started for a bowling saloon; got part way; friend
                  proposed that we should stop at milk punch place and take a suck—took a suck; got
                  to a rolling place; thought I'd roll first ball; didn't stay on the alley; the
                  second I let slip behind me, and it smashed a bird cage, and demolished a canary,
                  while the last one hit the pin-boy and knocked him through the side of the house;
                  friend said, shouldn't we go to the bar, and "Let 'em up"—"Let 'em up," and kept
                  doing so till the floor looked like a river, and I tried to drink the coal hod,
                  under the impression that it was a glass of brandy and sugar, hot; friend said,
                  shouldn't we julip—juliped; he then proposed that we should cocktail—cocktailed;
                  friend borrowed my pocketbook and coat; officer came, and here I am.
               Mr. Green was reprimanded and discharged, further punishment being considered
                  unnecessary, in consideration of his loss while seeing the elephant.
            
            
               FASHION AND INFLUENZA.
               
                  "THAT fairy form muffled in shawls FANNY! why?
                  What sorrow hath swoln and beclouded thine eye?
                  
                     
                  
                  What can have occasioned the tint of the rose
                  To abandon that cheek for the end of that nose?
               
               
                  "Strange ornament, strip of mere flannel, to deck
                  That swanlike, that snowy, that statuesque neck!
                  Why sit o'er the fender in such an odd trim
                  With handkerchief stanching those red orbs that swim?"
               
               
                  "For shabe, HELRY! dolt you bake ful so of be;

                  "I cal't thilk, I cal't tell at all, I dol't low."
                  "You don't think damp feet may have brought it about?"
                  "Lo, I've worl Ildia rubber shoes whel I've beel out."
               
               
                  "I think I can tell what has caused a catarrh
                  Those charms to disfigure, those accents to mar;
                  The bonnet, my FANNY, was meant for the head,
                  But FANNY wears hers 'twixt the shoulders instead."

               THE PERPLEXED HOUSEKEEPER.
               
                  I WISH I had a dozen pairs
                  Of hands, this very minute;
                  I'd soon put all these things to rights;
                  The very deuce is in it.
               
               
                  Here's a big washing to be done,
                  One pair of hands to do it,
                  Sheets, shirts, and stockings, coats and pants
                  How will I e'er get through it?
               
               
               
                  Dinner to get for six or more,
                  No loaf left o'er from Sunday;
                  And baby cross as he can live—
                  He's always so on Monday.
               
               
                  And there's the cream, 'tis getting sour,
                  And must forthwith be churning,
                  And here's Bob wants a button on—
                  Which way shall I be turning?
               
               
                  'Tis time the meat was in the pot,
                  The bread was worked for baking,
                  The clothes were taken from the boil—
                  O dear! the baby's waking.
               
               
                  
               
               
                  Hush, baby dear, there hush sh-sh!
                  I wish he'd sleep a little,
                  Till I could run and get some wood
                  To hurry up that kettle.
               
               
                  O dear! if P—— comes home
                  And finds things in this pother,
                  He'll just begin to tell me all
                  About his tidy mother!
               
               
                  How nice her kitchen used to be,
                  Her dinner always ready
                  Exactly when the noon-bell rung—
                  Hush, hush, dear little Freddy.
               
               
                  And then will come some hasty word
                  Right out before I'm thinking—
                  They say that hasty words from wives
                  Set sober men to drinking.
               
               
                  Now isn't that a great idea,
                  That men should take to sinning,
                  Because a weary, half-sick wife
                  Can't always smile so WINNING?
               
               
                  When I was young I used to earn
                  My living without trouble,
                  Had clothes and pocket money, too,
                  And hours of leisure double.
               
               
                  I never dreamed of such a fate,
                  When I, A-LASS! was courted—
                  Wife, mother, nurse, seamstress, cook, housekeeper, chamber-maid, laundress,
                     dairy woman, and scrub generally, doing the work of six,
                  For the sake of being supported!
               
            
            
               "HE WAS A PIOUS MAN AND SAVED HIS CHIST."
               
                  
                  RECENTLY, a gentleman riding in an Eastern railroad car which was
                  sparsely supplied with passengers, observed, in a seat before him, a lean,
                  slab-sided Yankee; every feature in his face seemed to ask a question, and a
                  little circumstance soon proved that he possessed a more "inquiring mind." Before
                  him, occupying the entire seat, sat a lady dressed in deep black, and after
                  shifting his position several times, and manœuvring to get an opportunity to look
                  into her face, he at length caught her eye.
               
               "In affliction?"
               "Yes, sir," responded the lady.
               "Parent?—father or mother?"
               "No, sir."
               "Child, perhaps?—a boy or girl?"
               "No, sir, not a child—I have no children."
               "Husband, then, I expect?"
               "Yes," was the curt answer.
               "Hum!—cholery?—a tradin' man may be?"
               "My husband was a sea faring man—the captain of a vessel, he didn't die of
                  cholera, he was drowned."
               "Oh, drowned, eh?" pursued the inquisitor, hesitating for a brief instant.
               "Save his chist?"
               "Yes, the vessel was saved, and my husband's effects," said the widow.
               "Was they?" asked the Yankee, his eyes brightening up.
                     "Pious man?"
               "He was a member of the Methodist church."
               The next question was a little delayed, but it came.
               "Don't you think you have great cause to be thankful that he was a pious man and
                  saved his chist?"
               "I do," said the widow abruptly, and turned her head to look out of the window.
                  The indefatigable "pump" changed his position, held the widow his glittering eye
                  once more, and propounded one more query, in a lower tone, with his head slightly
                  inclined forward, over the back of the seat: "Was you calculating to get married
                  again?"
               "Sir," said the widow, indignantly, "you are impertinent!" And she left her seat
                  and took another on the other side of the car.
               "'Pears to be a little huffy!" said the ineffable bore. Turning to our narrator
                  behind him:
               "What did they make you pay for that umbrella you've got in your hand?"
            
            
               THE PERFIDY OF CAPTAIN SLYBOOTS.
               
                  
                  CAPTAIN SLYBOOTS, quotha Macheath was a captain, and so was Kidd the
                  pirate. I'd captain them! I'm not a revengeful man. I love my neighbors as myself.
                  But I confess that I should like to see Captain Slyboots boiled; that I should
                  like to see him grilled; that I should like to run red-hot forks—three
                  pronged—into those confounded blue eyes of his, and to introduce the sharp-pointed
                  blades of penknives between his flesh and his fingernails. He has destroyed my
                  happiness. He has made a Sahara desert of Arabella Lodge, and reared a hideous
                  Upas tree in the middle of the Brussels carpet in the back drawing-room. Yes; the
                  back drawing-room, for there—but be calm my raging soul; let me relate the story
                  of my wrongs for the benefit of husbands in general, and gunpowder agents in
                  particular. Let me gibbet this monster, and nail him, like a vampire bat of a
                  light dragoon as he is against the door of the temple of Hymen. Give me a pen of
                  adamant and a pint bottle of gall, and I will commit to paper the particulars of
                  the atrocious—the fiendish, perfidy of Captain Slyboots.
               I spoke of gun powder agents. I'm one of them. I have an office in Broad Street
                  Buildings, in the city of London, where I carry on the chief agency of the
                  Bangford Powder Mills. You need not be afraid to come and see me. We don't keep
                  much on the premises, and I never smoke before lunch. Good years, bad years, my
                  commission, salary and perquisites, bring me in eight hundred a year. I keep a dog-cart; my wife has a brougham,
                  whenever she chooses to ask her "Hubby"—or rather the wretched outcast who was
                  once known to her by that endearing diminutive—for it. I live at Arabella Lodge,
                  Brompton, and my name is Harcourt Symes. I have done with the vanities of this
                  world now; so I don't mind telling you that I was christened Thomas, and that my
                  papa used to spell his surname thus—Sims.
               My Arabella—I don't mean my house, but my wife—was the beauty of Herne Bay; and I
                  married her there in 'fifty-three. I married her for her loving heart, her varied
                  accomplishments, and her long black ringlets. She had a little property, which I
                  valued little indeed in comparison with her own sweet self, and which I have
                  invested very advantageously. We have two children now—poor helpless
                  innocents!—Grenville Harcourt, aged three, I intend shall become a civil engineer;
                  Arabella-Louisa, aged two, is destined for the church. The dear little creature is
                  so staid and solemn, that my wife declares that when she grows up some bishop will
                  be sure to fall in love with her and marry her.
               Up to the month of November last year, Arabella Lodge was a model on a small scale
                  of the garden of Eden. I don't think any children in Brompton ever cried so seldom
                  as did ours. My Arabella was a capital manager, and the housekeeping bills were
                  very moderate. Our cook was a treasure, and our two housemaids pearls; and as for
                  James the footboy, I never knew such a clever boy as that boy. In gardening,
                  grooming, knife-cleaning, errand-running, door-answering, and
                  bringing home books from the circulating library, he was an Admirable Crichton. He
                  had but one failing—a leaning towards singing nigger melodies, accompanied on the
                  bones, in the back garden late at night; but a timely admonition, and a mild
                  application of the back of a clothes-brush to the head, cured him of that
                  ungenteel propensity. I don't think, six months ago, there was a happier man in
                  Brompton—in London—in England—than Harcourt Symes. Slippers always ready when I
                  came home; children always shiny-faced and well-dressed, with pink bows on their
                  plump little shoulders as big as kites; cat—I hate cats—always snugly locked up in
                  the coal-cellar; my Arabella smiling; my dog Buffo turning over head and heels
                  with delight in the gravel-path; the leaves of the new books all cut, the dinner
                  ready, and the wine decanted. We were visited by and received the best families in
                  the neighborhood and outlying suburbs. The Almond Tumblers, of Thurlow Square
                  (rich conveyancing family), the Pouter Pigeons of the Gloucester Road, the
                  Cotchins of Brompton Square, the Chiners of Chiswick Mall. We had people from
                  Kensington Palace—from the Royal Palace at Kensington—yes, sir—beneath our humble
                  roof. Old Lady Fang, widow of George the Third's dentist and cupper, and enjoying
                  the hospitality of a grateful country in that dignified retreat, took up my
                  Arabella. She invited the very best society to our house. The Honorable Miss Julia
                  Medea Buffleton, (she lives at Hampton Court Palace, yes, sir, and is
                  first cousin to the Lord Buffleton) used to come and read her three
                  volume novels of fashionable life to my wife, before she sent them to the crack
                  west-end publishers, who were only prevented from giving them to the world by an infamous combination of literary cliques. Young Guffoon told me
                  as much; and young Guffoon ought to know. I never mentioned the gunpowder business
                  at Brompton, of course; that might have led to "a blow up" you know (isn't that a
                  joke?); we gave snug little dinner parties, and quiet little dancing teas, and now
                  and then a regular first-rate concert and soiree. I am not a vain man, but I think
                  I can boast of having seen the prettiest girls and the most genteel-looking
                  parties—I mean men—in our suite of rooms at Arabella Lodge, that are visible
                  anywhere out of Almacks or Her Majesty's drawing-room.
               In an evil hour—what do I say—a fatal, an irrevocable hour, the path of our
                  turtle-dove felicity was crossed by Captain Slyboots. My wife picked him up—yes,
                  "picked him up" is the word—at the annual ball in aid of the funds for providing
                  small-tooth combs for the destitute Shetland ponies, held at the Hanover Square
                  Rooms. I had an engagement at Greenwich that day. I think the landlord of the
                  Trafalgar wanted some gunpowder; at all events, I went down, and half-a-dozen
                  jolly fellows from the city, who, curiously, all had business in Greenwich that
                  day, went with me. We dined together when business was over, and felt so exhausted
                  with the mental anxiety we had gone through—you know how harassing business
                  matters are—that we could not possibly get back to town till the last train. Lady
                  Fang had kindly promised to be my wife's chaperon at the ball (which was a very
                  exclusive one, vouchers, signed by two ladies patronesses, being requisite to
                  procure a ticket, quite tip-top style) so I felt quite easy on my Arabella's
                  account. When I returned home rather late that night—for feeling rather hungry
                  after the railroad journey, I had dropped in to have some supper at my club—I
                  found a white camelia in a glass of water on my wife's dressing-table. Her own
                  bouquet, which I had sent her that morning from Covent Garden, lay beside it, all
                  crumpled and faded. I never was of a jealous disposition—never! never! ha ha! hoo! never—and I thought no more
                  about it. I know now who gave her that camelia.
               The next morning Arabella told me all about Captain Slyboots. He was the most
                  delightful creature, she said—so droll, so full of anecdote, so truly
                     distinguished. He had been presented to her by Lady Fang herself, and
                  was, indeed, a distant connection of her Ladyship. He, Slyboots, was the only son
                  of Sir Crispin Slyboots, of Diddlecot Hall, Learyshire, immensely rich, captain in
                  the 21st Hussars, and all the rest of it. It was by the merest chance that he
                  happened to be in town so late in the year, but was in London, she believed, in
                  order to settle something with the family lawyers, about the estates in
                  Learyshire. He had asked permission to call; permission had been granted, and he
                  was to make a call that very day—a morning call. I am the most unsuspicious man
                  breathing, and had my wife told me then—mark me, then—that the Sultan
                  of Turkey, or Governor Brigham Young, or any other polygamical villain, was to
                  call at Arabella Lodge, I should have driven into the city with a light heart. It
                  was not long before I saw Captain Slyboots. I had to ask him to dinner before the
                  week was over. He came very often, not too often for me then, for he
                  had such insinuating, such persuasive ways about him, that I really liked the
                  fellow. He found out all about the gunpowder, and rallied me—"chaffed," he called
                  it—in a manner at which it was impossible to be offended, but for which I should
                  like to kick him, now. He did me the honor—I mean he had the impudence, to call on
                  me in my office in the city one morning, and borrowed ten pound of me in the most
                  affable—I mean in the most jesuitical manner. I must do him the justice to say
                  that he paid me the money back; I wish he hadn't, that I might sue him, and
                  accumulate costs against him, and immerse him in a life-long dungeon. Saba! He was
                  over six feet high, and had fair whiskers, which he curled; and fair hair, which
                  he parted down the middle; and fair moustaches, which he twisted; and very white
                  teeth, and a white hooked nose, like an eagle's beak. His eyes, as I have said,
                  were blue. You see that to all appearance he was as like as two peas to the heavy
                  swells one sees flattening their noses against the windows of the army and navy
                  club-houses, or smoking big Milo cigars outside four-in-hands; but Captain
                  Slyboots was of a very different order. He wasn't solemn and sheepish and foolish,
                  like the grandly-dressed young fellows one meets out. The wretch could sing and
                  dance, and imitate the noises of animals, and play the banjo, and do tricks with
                  the cards. He could mesmerise, and make pigs out of oranges. He was a dab at
                  table-turning; could make a hat spin like a teetotum; knew lots of poetry and all
                  that; talked about chemistry and Mr. Faraday; taught my wife potichomanie and modelling in wax; was the best archer—I had a target in my back
                  garden—I ever knew, and played the pianoforte brilliantly. Oh, he was
                  sly, he was! If I hadn't known him to be the son of a baronet, and heir to eight
                  thousand a year, I should have taken him to be a play-actor. All the girls who
                  visited us were mad after him. Clara Cotchins, (who has a good bit of money of her
                  own, though her father is only Cotchins, R A., the farm-yard painter) positively
                  threw herself at him, like a boomerang; but she came back again, also like a
                  boomerang, and because Captain Slyboots wouldn't make love to her, she said he was
                  a puppy. A puppy! you might as well call a Bengal tiger a kitten. Mrs. Almond
                  Tumbler conceived a violent hatred to my wife, because the Captain visited oftener
                  at Arabella House than in Thurlow Square, and took an early occasion to inform
                  Captain Slyboots in strict confidence that we were only "people in the
                  city,"—"something quite low," she believed. I should like to know what the
                  Tumblers are forsooth, if not people in Bedford Row, who make their living by
                  grinding the noses of their unfortunate clients. I always hated lawyers. The
                  Captain laughed, told my wife the story, and drew a pen-and-ink caricature of Mrs.
                  Almond Tumbler—who had three distinct double chins, one under the other, like a
                  flight of stairs going the wrong way—which sent us all into extacies of
                  laughter.
               You know what a rage there was last winter for private theatricals. From Woburn
                  Abbey to Camberwell Grove, the mania for amateur play-acting spread like an
                  epidemic. Brompton didn't escape the infection; Kensington took it severely. The
                  Pouter Pigeons gave a grand performance on New Year's Eve in the Gloucester Road,
                  and a ball afterwards. A dramatised version of the "Old Curiosity Shop" was the
                  piece of the evening, and Clara Pigeon, who is at least five feet eight inches
                  high (she is called the "Grenadier" in the domestic circle), insisted upon playing
                  "Little Nell." To diminish from the effect of her stature she wore a ridiculously
                  short skirt, which made her look like an overgrown ballet-girl. To mend matters,
                  Master Tom Pigeon, who is about six inches taller than his sister, must needs play
                  "Quilp," and in order to give himself the appearance of a dwarf, he bent his legs
                  and hunched his body to such an extent that in the middle of the piece he was
                  seized with the cramps, and was carried off the stage. He wasn't seen again but
                  lay on the sofa behind the scenes, moaning dismally, while Miss Pitcher, the
                  teacher from Minerva House, played airs from the "Trovatore" on the piano.
               Of course, we must have our share in private theatricals, and early in the present year my wife propounded to
                  me a notable plan for an amateur performance on the night of the 14th of
                  February—Valentine's Day, you know. I gave way to her, as I did in everything,
                     then, and gave her a cheque into the bargain. The programme was
                  most elaborate. First, we were to have a grand operatic selection by lady and
                  gentleman executants; accompanyist, the famous Signor Papadaggi, who was my wife's
                  singing-master, and whom I would gladly have paid for his services (Arabella
                  has—she had, rather—a delicious contralto voice), but who insisted
                  upon giving his gratuitous aid out of regard for Captain Slyboots, who was
                  "ticklar frez of 'is," he said. After the opera was to come a solo on the bassoon
                  by Jack Blunderbore, who is a friend of mine in the city (Blunderbore and
                  Doublebarrel, gun-stock makers, Barbican), and whom I instructed, after his
                  performance on the bassoon was over, to sit in a corner and say not one word till
                  supper time, when I would make it up to him in game pie and champagne. Jack, who
                  is one of the best-natured fellows alive, promised at once. The performances were
                  to end with an entirely new and original farce, written by Ethelred
                  Guffoon, Esq., entitled "The Kiss and the Kick; or, A Hint to Husbands."
               Guffoon, a good-natured young fellow enough, who wore peg-top trousers and a
                  chin-tuft, was a clerk in the Nose-bag and Check-string section of the Hackney
                  Carriage Department in the Inland Revenue Office, Somerset House. I don't think
                  that his official duties took up much of his time, for he found abundant leisure
                  to write farces, paint impossible landscapes on tinted paper, and make himself
                  agreeable in genteel society, where, from his amiable manners and comic
                  acquirements, he was highly popular. The mammas were not very anxious about him on
                  account of their daughters one way or the other, for it was generally understood
                  that he had a hopeless attachment for a marchioness, who wrote Latin verses and
                  played the violoncello, and was thereby condemned to perpetual celibacy. He was
                  good enough, as I have said, to write the farce of "The Kiss and the Kick" for us;
                  and he was, in virtue of his indubitably vast theatrical experience, appointed
                  stage manager, acting manager, prompter and general director of our dramatic
                  entertainments. There wasn't much plot in his farce, but there was a great deal of
                  fun. The point on which the piece seemed to turn was this: that a Chevalier
                  Somebody stole a kiss from the Marquise de Somebody Else, and that the Marquis,
                  her injured husband, coming in at the very nick of time, revenged himself upon the
                  Chevalier by inflicting on him a violent kick in the skirts of his brocaded coat.
                  The scene of the piece had originally been laid in England—at Camberwell, if I
                  remember rightly—and the Chevalier, under the name of Prupper, was to have worn a
                  grass-green coat with brass basket buttons, a white hat, speckled stockings, and
                  nankeen inexpressibles; but, as the ladies thought that hoops and powder would
                  look pretty—and as the gentlemen had no objection to bag wigs and swords (though
                  some were slightly timorous about the effects of shorts and silk stockings till
                  padding was suggested by the artful Captain Slyboots), the venue was changed to
                  Versailles, and the kick was supposed to be inflicted for the kiss given in the
                  palmy days of Louis the Fifteenth. Now, as a malignant fate would have it,
                  Guffoon, who had the distribution of the parts, "cast" me—that was the term he
                  used—for the Marquis, Arabella for the Marchioness, and Captain Slyboots for
                     the Chevalier. I winced a good deal at this; for, though no sensible
                  husband ought to have any objection to his pretty wife being kissed (in fun) by an
                  intimate friend—don't we do it all round in our game of forfeits at Christmas?—I
                  could not bear the idea of Captain Slyboots' moustached lips touching my
                  Arabella's cheek; of course he was only to kiss her cheek. I remonstrated with my
                  wife, I privately entreated Guffoon to change the "casts;" I offered, time after
                  time, to change parts with Slyboots, offering to let him kick me with spurs on if
                  he chose; but all to no avail. Everybody, friends included, declared that I was
                  cut out for the Marquis; and at last, for fear of seeming to be jealous, and
                  consequently ridiculous, I consented to waive my objection. "But what a kick I
                  will give him," I thought to myself, "on the night of performance, to be
                  sure."
               Would you believe it, that on the very first rehearsal of the farce, Captain
                  Slyboots coolly told me that of course he should kiss Arabella! I pointed out to
                  him that such a proceeding at this stage was not only highly indecorous but wholly 
                     unnecesssary
                     unnecessary
                  ; that a kiss was an operation that needed no rehearsing, and that both
                  kissing and kicking could be postponed till the grand night. But my objections
                  were scarcely uttered, before there arose from the audience (for we had a large
                  audience at all the rehearsals) such a Babel of laughter and remonstrance that I
                  was almost stunned. "I ought to know better;" "I was paying a bad compliment to my
                  wife;" "Of course Captain Slyboots must kiss her," and the like. Even old Lady
                  Fang shook her snuff-box at me, and said "Fie, fie, jealous man!" Some of them
                  called me Bluebeard; and Miss Grenadier Pigeon quoted the lines about the
                  "green-eyed monster." Miss Almond Tumbler told me plainly that I ought to be
                  ashamed of myself; and my wife evinced such unmistakeable signs of beginning to
                  cry, that I bowed my head and submitted. "Kiss her, Captain," I said in a faint voice. Somehow, that
                  kiss took a long time to rehearse; but when I really heard a good sounding smack,
                  I rushed  on to the stage—the carpet of the back drawing-room I mean, and
                  was about to assuage my wrath in kicks—in kicks mind, not in a kick, when Ethelred
                  Guffoon seized me round the waist, and from that detestable audience of women in
                  the front drawing-room there arose a cry of "No! no! no! not till the
                  night—not till the night!" Again did old Lady Fang shake her snuff-box at me; this
                  time she called me, "Cruel, spiteful man, to want to kick dear Captain Slyboots
                  more than once." Again did Arabella show symptoms of tears, and again, like a
                  hound as I was, did I bow my head, and to my shame and sorrow submit. So Captain
                  Slyboots kissed Mrs. Symes, and I wasn't allowed to kick him. Alaloo!
                  vengeance!
               My friends, this martyrdom went on for nearly a month. We had a rehearsal almost
                  every day, sometimes twice a day. The instant I came back from Broad Street
                  Buildings—and I very frequently missed going altogether, leaving my clerks,
                  Cartooch and Squibber, junior, in charge—they were sure to "call the farce," and
                  Mrs. S. went through her part, and I didn't go through mine, and Captain Slyboots
                  did nothing but laugh and twirl pirouettes upon his military heels.
               But on the 6th of February I walked—walked, sir—down to Toeser, my bootmaker, in
                  Jermyn Street, St. James's.
               "Toeser," I asked, darkly, "are pointed toes worn now?"
               "Rounds is most fash'nable."
               "Make me," I said sternly and gloomily, "a pair of the best Wellingtons—the
                  strongest leather, mind; but they must be varnished, and cut as they are in this
                  colored print of the Duke de Richelieu which I will leave with you: let the toes
                  be of the sharpest and hardest you can make. Let there be double soles and iron
                  heels" (for I thought the affair might end seriously, and that it was as well to
                  be prepared with means for stamping on my enemy), "and let me have them home,
                  without fail, this day week. You understand." Toeser bowed and sniffed at an
                  unfinished boot, his usual mode of expressing acquiescence in the wishes of a
                  customer, and I left the shop with a lightened heart.
               The boots came home on the 13th; and I did not go to the office that day, but
                  passed the greater portion of my time in my dressing-room, gloating over the
                  instruments of retribution as they gleamed on their trees. "I will
                  kick him, and no mistake," I thought.
               By great good fortune it had been settled that, in order to relieve the monotony
                  of the shorts and silk stockings, I was to be a sporting marquis, and to wear
                  buckskins and boots—bottes à l'écuyére, I think
                  Guffoon called them. His Imperial Majesty Napoleon the Third wears similar boots
                  when he goes out hunting.
               I drove down to Broad Street Buildings for a couple of hours next morning—the
                  morning of the day, just to see how things were getting on. Everything was
                  progressing smoothly for the performance. Simmons's men had brought the portable
                  theatre and scenery; the costumes were to come from Nathan's; the supper was
                  ordered; the supply of extra waiters laid on, the invitations duly sent out and
                  responded to. I felt in high spirits; and giving my groom a holiday, took an
                  omnibus back to Brompton, and arrived at Arabella Lodge about two in the
                  afternoon.
               I found my wife in her morning gown, and a flood of tears, on the sofa. With one
                  hand she held her handkerchief to her face, in the other the clutched a
                  letter.
               
               "What is the matter, my poppet?" I said, caressingly, thinking that Simmons's man
                  and the extra waiters had been, too much for her nerves.
               "G-g-g-g-gone," she sobbed.
               "Who's gone?" I asked, thinking, perhaps, that our Admirable Crichton, the
                  footboy, might, as a finishing stroke of genius, have absconded with the
                  plate-basket.
               "G-O-O-O-ONE AWAY," she repeated, holding out the letter.
               I seized the fatal epistle, I recognized the horribly familiar handwriting, and I
                  read this:— 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "My DEAR MRS. SYMES
                              
                              (his dear Mrs. Symes, indeed!)—I much regret to say
                                 that I shall not be able to fill my part in your private
                                 theatricals of this evening. I have received orders from the Horse
                                 Guards to join my regiment at Bhowaljuggerpore, without a moment's
                                 delay. I leave by the twelve o'clock train for Alexandria, viâ Dover and Marseilles, en route for Calcutta. Pray apologise
                                 for me to all our friends, especially to your husband, whom I am
                                 sincerely sorry to rob of his legitimate retaliation.
                                 I will write at length from Marseilles." (Will he
                                 write at length from Marseilles?)
                              
                                 "Most truly yours,
                                 "VULPUS REYNARD LUPUS SLYBOOTS."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               I crushed up the abominable epistle in my hand; I folded my arms, and assuming the
                  majestic look of Lucius Junius Brutus when he—but I really forget what he was
                  doing when he did it—I said to Mrs. Symes—
               "Madam"—I had never called her "Madam" but once before in my life, and that when
                  she was a Miss, and I apologized for treading on her toes while dancing with her
                  at the Caledonian ball. "Madam, if she wasn't such an intolerable old catamaran
                  that no human being could live with her, and be alive at the end of the week, I'd
                  send you home to your mother. As it is, you will be kind enough to put off the
                  absurd, disgusting, degrading tomfoolery of to-night. Say you are ill—that I am
                  ill. Say, if you like, that I have cut my throat, and shall be back in a week." I
                  was so agitated that I did not know what I said.
               I left my wife in hysterics; sent her maid to her, and rushing out, hailed a
                  Hansom cab, and told the cabman to drive me into town. I alighted at Essex Street
                  in the Strand, scarcely knowing where I was going, and found MYSELF somehow on the
                  pier and aboard a steamer. I was landed at the Old Shades Pier; if I had been
                  landed at Copenhagen it would have been all the same to me. As I was moodily
                  threading my way towards Thames Street (as a long cut towards Broad Street
                  Buildings), a little ragged urchin came tumbling head over heels before me, and
                  importuned me to buy cigar-lights. I never did so cruel, so mean, so cowardly a
                  thing in my life; but I could not resist the instinct of being revenged on
                     somebody. I caught the boy in a favorable position, and I gave him
                     one sounding kick that sent him flying among the rabble rout of
                  his companions with a howl that would have awakened the Seven Sleepers. . . . . .
                  . . . .
               P. S.—Arabella and I are reconciled now. She has confessed to me, with many tears
                  and kisses, that she never liked Captain Slyboots; and always thought him
                  deceitful. Besides, old Lady Fang says that he has been engaged for years to his
                  cousin, Miss De Loup.
               I am happy again; though occasionally nervous that Lady Fang should find out that
                  we are city people; but if Captain Slyboots ever comes back from India, and I meet
                  him, I—I—I—I'll most certainly cut him.
            
            
               MY ELOPEMENT.
               AN INCIDENT IN THE LIFE OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WISHED TO GET MARRIED ON
                  THREE HUNDRED A YEAR.
               I SHALL not mention my name. You may call me what you like. Augustus, Reginald,
                  Almanzor—anything will do. What I am going to tell happened many years since.
               Not only shall I abstain from mentioning my own name, but I shall also carefully
                  avoid giving any, even the slightest, clue to the identity of the young lady, who,
                  by-the-bye, must be now a middle-aged lady. This reminds me that I also am not so
                  young as I was: but no matter.
               We were talking the other night, at the club, about getting married on three
                  hundred a year. The most absurd nonsense was uttered. One fellow said you could
                  live without wine; another, that dinner parties were not essential to happiness
                  and so on; but they'll take precious good care not to get married themselves, for
                  all that. It isn't a question whether a man can get married on three hundred a
                  year, for any man with a tongue in his head, and half a sovereign in his pocket,
                  can persuade some girl or other to have him, and, what's more, can pay the
                  necessary fees—if he doesn't mind getting married by banns, which appears now to
                  be the fashion. No; the question is whether you can be as jolly on three hundred a
                  year, married, as you may sometimes contrive to be with that amount of income when
                  you are single (I say sometimes, for, after all, three hundred a year is not much,
                  and very few fellows who are condemned to live upon it can succeed in making both
                  ends meet).
               
               Well, my answer to the question is this, that if a single man can only just live
                  upon three hundred a year, a married man can't do it at all; that is to say, not
                  if he means to give anything to his wife and children. Women don't eat much, and,
                  fortunately, don't drink at all; but they wear a lot of clothes, and don't object
                  to jewelry. Then wives have an inveterate, and I suppose invincible, habit of
                  having children, and children want nurses, and boots, and drums, and all sorts of
                  things.
               
                  
                     A BACHELOR'S VIEW OF MATRIMONY.
                  
               
               There is one kind of marriage, however, which suits a man of three hundred a year
                  admirably. I mean marriage with a rich heiress. A man with only three hundred a
                  year may safely marry a woman who has three thousand. This is just what I tried to
                  do, and it wasn't quite so easy as you may imagine, though I was thirty-two at the
                  time, and the girl only sixteen. She was so infernally romantic, you see, and I'm
                  not romantic at all. I can make love and all that sort of thing, and know when to
                  squeeze a woman's hand—and never did so either too soon or too late (except with
                  the one I am going to tell you about, and she wouldn't stand it any time). But I
                  can't manufacture sentiment very fast, having never been accustomed to the society
                  of school girls; and that's just what spoiled the whole business. Still, I
                     do think that if a young girl gets into a post-chaise with you,
                  the least she can do is to behave herself until the end of the journey. I've been
                  thinking about it ever since, and all I regret now is that I didn't make a
                  confounded row about it at the time.
               As I said before, I can't mention her name, because I promised I wouldn't, and for
                  other reasons besides. However, her father was a rich manufacturer—say at
                  Manchester; and her mother had been dead and buried long before—say at Kensal
                  Green. As for the daughter, I think she was a pretty girl, but I know she was
                  immensely rich. The money that girl had in the funds was something enormous
                  although this was only what she got from her mother. Her father was sure to leave
                  her a lot of money besides; but, of course, I knew there would be a quarrel with
                  the old man after the elopement. However, she could not help having a clear sixty
                  thousand pounds, and although it was all settled on herself, we could have lived
                  deuced well on the interest.
               
                  
                     THE RICH MANUFACTURER.
                  
               
               As we must call her something (I suppose, Mr. Editor, you would not admit a
                  heroine without any name at all?) we will call her Julia. I first heard of her
                  from my sister, who was at school with her at Paris, at Madame Favre's in the
                  Champs Elysées. It was what is called a "finishing" school, and I think it
                  deserved the name, for it turned out some of the most finished coquettes I ever
                  saw. Julia however, had not yet reached coquettishness. The coquettes were all in
                  the sixth class—that class which contains the "philosophers" in the 
                  French collegiate system. Julia was only in the fifth—corresponding to "rhetoric"
                  in the colleges—and had not yet gone beyond sentiment and romance. It must be
                  remembered that she was not more than sixteen.
               
               The course of studies pursued at Madame Favre's—at least in the upper classes—was
                  in fact, nothing more nor less than a course of love. Was it the course of true
                  love? asks the reader. I am inclined to think it was not, if only from the fact
                  that, as a general rule, it did "run smooth." In the fourth class,
                  the little girls of thirteen and fourteen read "Paul and Virginia," or other tales
                  of a comparatively innocent nature; in the fifth, they studied the novels of
                  Richardson and Rousseau; but, in the sixth, they affected to have lived through
                  "such childishness," and thought of nothing but their chances of establishing
                  themselves in large houses, with rich husbands ready to pay the largest bills.
               Where the novels came from I don't know—probably they procured them, through the
                  servants, from some circulating library. But I am quite certain they used to read
                  them, and it was chiefly owing to my supposed resemblance to some fellow called
                  Ernest de Waldemar—the hero of one of the books—that Julia (as we have now agreed
                  to call her) ultimately consented to elope with me.
               The first time I saw her was at a distribution of prizes in the summer of 18—. I
                  knew she was English by two things. First of all, she had beautiful light-brown
                  hair, such as French girls seldom have; secondly, the priest who gave the prizes
                  away did not kiss her on the forehead. Whenever one of the French girls went up
                  for a prize, Father Someone-or-other, who presided at the distribution, crowned
                  her with a wreath, gave her a very small book and a very large certificate of good
                  conduct, and then imprinted a cold, chaste kiss on her brow as the young lady bent
                  forward with much meekness to receive it. The Protestant 
                     DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRIZES.
                   girls, however, did not see the fun, as they expressed it, of being
                  kissed by an ugly old father confessor, and it was quite understood that they were
                  not to receive the customary salute.
               My sister, who had no prize to take (our family was never remarkable for brilliant
                  accomplishments), was sitting by my side; and as Julia passed before us, with her
                  little book and her large certificate, she smiled and stopped to receive her
                  congratulations.
               As a compatriot, and the brother of one of her fellow-pupils, I took upon myself
                  to congratulate Miss Julia also. She started, blushed, and after I had gone, told
                  my sister that I was the very image of Ernest de Waldemar.
               "And who is this Ernest?"
               "How foolish you are!" was the reply. "Ernest de Waldemar is her hero. Laure de
                  Marsan and Julia are both in love with him, and, as for Julia, she scarcely talks
                  of anything else."
               "And what will she do to me for being like him? Is she very savage?"
               "Why, how stupid you must be? She likes you for it. She thinks you are so like him
                  that you must have all his noble qualities."
               "Poor girl!" I remarked.
               "Not so poor as you imagine," replied my sister, making, almost unconsciously, one
                  of those puns in which some young ladies delight. "How much do you suppose she has
                  a year?"
               "I'm sure I can't say."
               "Well, I don't know exactly myself, but I know she has hundreds and thousands of
                  pounds in the funds."
               "If she has only a few thousand pounds in the funds, she will not get much a year
                  out of that."
               "Well, I'll ask her. I know it's a great deal."
               "Do," I replied. "I should very much like to know."
               When I saw my sister again she brought me an invitation to a ball which was to
                  take place at Madame Favre's.
               "Julia will be so glad if you come," she added.
               I had almost forgotten Julia's existence, but now that I was reminded of it, I
                  asked about the small sum of money in the funds.
               "Small sum, indeed!" exclaimed my sister. "She's sixty thousand pounds left her by
                  her mother. Nothing can prevent her having it when she is of age, or before, if
                  she marries with her father's consent."
               "Oh, he'll never give his consent," I observed, half to myself.
               "Never give his consent! And why not?" asked my sister.
               "No, that's not what I meant," I replied. But I omitted to add that I had been
                  thinking of proposing to her myself, and had just imagined the probable answer to
                  any such offer on my part.
               Then I went on to reflect that a girl with sixty thousand pounds was not to be met
                  with every day, and that I should be a flat to miss such a chance. As for proposing to her in a formal manner,
                  that was all nonsense. The father would say she was too young, and then marry her
                  to some one else. I had been served that way once before.
               As I knew that my sister would, as a matter of course, disapprove of my plan for
                  carrying off her interesting young school-fellow, I thought it beat to keep all my
                  plans to myself. The first thing to do was to make love to Julia; so, at least, it
                  appeared to me, though I discovered when I saw her that she was already as much in
                  love with me as she could possibly be. It was impossible to produce a better
                  impression upon her than she had already received, and it was just possible that
                  this impression might be injured if I conversed with her too much; for, to tell
                  the truth, I never was a good talker. It always appeared to me that love-making
                  was a good deal like fishing. If the young lady is not thoroughly hooked, you must
                  use all your art until you have her fast; but if you are quite sure you have taken
                  her by the gills, pull her ashore at once. At all events, don't begin playing with
                  her, for, after all, you can but catch her, and you might break your
                  line.
               Therefore, all things considered, I determined not to make love to Miss Julia at
                  all, but to leave all that sort of thing to her own imagination and the good
                  offices of Mademoiselle Laure de Marsan, whom I found a most worthy coadjutor.
                  Laure, as we have seen, had herself been in love with Ernest de Waldemar, but she
                  generously admitted that Julia loved him—that is to say, loved
                  me—better than she did: and, like a good, affectionate girl, gave him
                  up—I mean gave me up—to her dear friend and school-fellow. But having done so, she
                  took a most admirable, because disinterested, interest in the progress of our
                  loves. She was for ever talking to Julia about me, and aided me in every possible
                  manner in conveying letters to Julia.
               When I said I did not make love to Julia, I forgot the letters. But I saw that it
                  was expected I should send a few. In fact, Laure hinted as much, and I of course
                  lost no time in complying with the suggestion of so accomplished a confidante. The
                  letters were declared to be very much like those of Ernest de Waldemar; and as
                  they happened to have been copied literally from certain epistles by the author of
                  the novel in which that estimable hero figures, I have no doubt that this
                  resemblance really existed.
               At last I entreated Julia to "fly with me." This was exactly five months after my
                  first interview with her. It was at another school-ball, given in honor of the new
                  year. (Since my elopement with Julia, the balls at Madame Favre's have only taken
                  place once a year; and, for some years afterwards, it was a rule that at least one
                  teacher should stand up in every quadrille that was danced—a regulation which has
                  considerably interfered with the gaiety of the proceedings.)
               This was how we arranged it—thanks to the skilful machinations of the romantic,
                  but ingenious, Laure de Marsan.
               On a certain day in February, Julia was to start for Italy with her aunt, a lady
                  who resided in Paris, and who was in the habit of visiting her niece about once in
                  three months. Julia's father was anxious his daughter should make this journey,
                  but the aunt herself did not seem very desirous that her niece should accompany
                  her. So, at least, I heard from my spies and confidantes; and I believe I was
                  pretty well served by them.
               Julia, by my directions, or rather by those of Mademoiselle de Marsan, in which I
                  always acquiesced, expressed her readiness, in the first instance, to accompany
                  her aunt. The school-bills were paid up to March, and everything was prepared for
                  the young lady's departure. Then, a few days before the time fixed for commencing
                  the journey (which was no joke then, let me tell you), Julia became suddenly
                  afraid of the fatigue—a bad excuse, but one which we knew the aunt would willingly
                  accept.
               The aunt was stopping at the Hotel des Princes, in the Rue Richelieu. On the eve
                  of the departure Julia went to her, told her she would prefer not to go to Italy
                  at all, that she would much rather go back to England, and that she would write to
                  her father to come and fetch her.
               "Well, my love," said the aunt, as she embraced her; "you know you're our spoiled
                  child, and do just as you like, so, as you wish it, you must go back to
                  England."
               Julia returned that night to the school, and the next morning at seven o'clock met
                  me at the very hotel which her aunt had left at six. If Madame Favre questioned
                  her coachman, all he could reply was, that he had been told to drive the young
                  lady to the Hotel des Princes, and that to the Hotel des Princes he had driven
                  her.
               The post-chaise was waiting for me in the court-yard, and at half-past seven we
                  had passed the barrier, and were galloping along the high road to Italy.
               Julia cried a little at first, but I persuaded her it was useless to do so,
                  bringing forward several excellent reasons in support of my argument, and at
                  length she became pacified.
               "How is Laure?" I inquired.
               "Quite well," said Julia, wiping her eyes. "She sent her love to you."
               "Have you her cousin's address at Lyons?"
               
               "Yes; here it is," she replied, giving me at the same time an envelope on which
                  was written the address of one of Laure's cousins, at whose house we were to be
                  received, and where we intended to have our wedding breakfast.
               
                  
                     THE ELOPEMENT.
                  
               
               This was the plan of my campaign. We were to go on without stopping as far as
                  Lyons. Travelling day and night it would be impossible to overtake us, even if the
                  alarm were given, which was by no means certain; and once at Lyons, all we had to
                  do was to go to the German church and get married forthwith. Then Julia was to
                  write to her father, and the marriage could afterwards be solemnized with his
                  consent, either before the English consul at Lyons, or at the chapel of the
                  embassy at Paris. But to apply at the English consulate for permission to marry a
                  girl of sixteen, with whom every one in the town would know, soon after the
                  arrival of the post-chaise, that I had eloped—this, it appeared to me, would be
                  imprudent and something more.
               "What will my poor aunt say?" exclaimed Julia thoughtfully, after we had proceeded
                  for some time in silence.
               I made no reply, for I didn't know what her poor aunt was likely to say, not
                  enjoying the honor of that lady's acquaintance.
               "And what a hypocrite she will consider me, pretending up to the last moment that
                  I wanted to accompany her, and even writing to take the rooms at the hôtel, and
                  all!"
               "What hôtel?" I inquired.
               "At Sens, where my aunt and myself meant to stop to-night."
               "Oh, that won't matter," I continued. "But where is Sens?"
               "Sens? I'm sure I forget. I didn't address the envelope."
               "Postillion," I exclaimed, "where is Sens?"
               "Sens? You want to know, sir, where Sens is? It's the last station you'll come to
                  to-night; that is to say, if you travel as you're doing now."
               "But we don't want to go to Sens."
               "I'm afraid, then, you're going there very fast, sir. But here are the
                  horses."
               We had now reached the first post-town. I gave the postillion two five-franc
                  pieces for the first stage, and told his successor to lose no time in getting the
                  horses harnessed.
               "Some foreign prince carrying off a banker's daughter," said the retiring postboy,
                  to the one who took his place, at the same time exhibiting the ten francs which he
                  had just received.
               "I forgot to ask about Sens," I remarked to Julia; and then, calling out to the
                  postillion, I inquired as to its locality.
               "Road to Lyons, sir," was the answer. "With patience and good horses you'll get
                  there before to-morrow morning."
               "I thought your aunt was going to Italy?" I observed to Julia.
               So she is. But may she not go to Italy through Lyons?"
               "Well, I shouldn't think so; but I don't know."
               "I think you might have ascertained that before," suggested Julia with a gentle
                  pout.
               "Postillion, postillion! which is the way to Italy?" I called.
               "This is the way, sir. All in good time," was the answer. "There's another road,
                  sir, and then, sir, you know that every road leads to Rome. But they mostly go
                  through Lyons, sir."
               "Confound it!" I muttered. "And so we shall be passing through the very place
                  where your aunt is. Where did you write to take the rooms?"
               "Hôtel de l'Europe."
               "We shall know what to avoid then. A pity you couldn't think where Sens was
                  before. Sens, Sens! As for me I never heard of it."
               "I thought I was under your protection, and that you would take the trouble to
                  ascertain where we were going before you started."
               "Well, don't cry, my beloved Julia, or I shall think you no longer love me."
               "My presence here is a sufficient proof of my affection. Oh! what a lovely
                  landscape," she then exclaimed, pointing to a valley with a river running through
                  it, and a few cows grazing about here and there.
               "Yes, a very fine landscape," I replied; "but not enough cows."
               She looked at me, and stared. The fact was, I was anxious to stop all sentimental
                  twaddle, because it's not my line, and I don't shine in it; and I therefore
                  thought I had better check this outburst about the landscape as soon as
                  possible.
               "Does that scene say nothing to your heart?" she continued. "Do you see no poetry
                  in that placid valley, in that calm rippling stream?"
               
               I now stopped her for another reason, for I began to think she might take me for
                  an unfeeling brute.
               "Yes, it's very beautiful," I replied. "Indeed it reminds me of something I saw at
                  the Diorama, or at the Water-Color Exhibition, in London, I forget which. But it's
                  very fine, whichever it was."
               After this, Julia remained silent for some minutes.
               "Do you read much poetry?" she asked when we again changed horses.
               "Not very much," I answered. "I used to read it at school, and write it out too, a
                  hundred lines at a time, when I had been doing anything wrong."
               "But I should have thought the study of poetry formed part of your daily
                  life."
               "No. In Paris I used to get up as late as I did in London: and then what with
                  breakfasting at a cafe, riding in the Bois de
                  Boulogne, calling on a few friends, dining, and then going to the opera or one or
                  two balls, I'd enough to do without reading poetry."
               "But surely you like poetry. I always thought you adored it," she continued.
               "I should like it very well if it weren't for the rhymes; but, as for adoring it,
                  I only adore you."
               The latter remark was made by way of conciliating the fair Julia, who seemed
                  determined that I should like exactly what she liked,—a notion which I thought I
                  might as well destroy as soon as possible. Besides, I don't like poetry at all.
                  I'm not very fond of prose; but as for poetry, I can't read a line.
               "You, the image of Ernest de Waldemar, not to like poetry! I thought you loved
                  it!"
               
                  
                     THE IMAGE OF ERNEST DE WALDEMAR.
                  
               
               "I only love you," I ventured to observe.
               "This is the second time you have paid me that compliment," said Julia,
                  impatiently. "Cannot we talk of something else?"
               "Well, what shall we talk of? Oh, here we change horses. By-the-bye you must want
                  breakfast. It's eleven o'clock."
               "I could not eat a thing."
               "Couldn't you? Well, I feel exceedingly hungry. When do you generally
                  breakfast?"
               "At seven; but to-day I am so restless, so agitated, I cannot think of such
                  things."
               "Well, to tell the truth, I feel rather peckish," said I: and, indeed, I did. "I
                  am accustomed to take my meals regularly, and I think I shall breakfast here."
               "And if we are being pursued?"
               "Oh, who's to pursue us? After you've been with me three hours in a post-chaise,
                  after running away from school, it is not very likely any one would object to my
                  marrying you; is it now?"
               "That may be, but it's not the way to look at it."
               "Will you breakfast at the post-house, sir, or at the hôtel?" said the postillion,
                  as he came to the window.
               "At the hotel, and the best in the place," was my prompt reply
               "You mean to breakfast?" expostulated Julia, "when you know we may be overtaken at
                  any minute. How could I bear such a scene? The disgrace would kill me."
               "But, my dearest love," I replied, "I always breakfast at eleven; and I have been
                  up to-day since five."
               "Were we not to hurry to Lyons, and be married there instantly on our arrival?
                  Pray, think of me and of my dreadful position, and do not let us have any needless
                  delay."
               The notion of calling breakfast a "needless delay," I think, was rather good. But
                  as Julia began to cry once more, I bought some bread and cheese and a bottle of
                  wine at an inn, and just before starting swallowed a large cup of coffee.
               I had determined, from the beginning, not to give in to Julia—a good-natured, but
                  at the same time a silly, sentimental girl, who wanted her romantic notions
                  knocked out of her head as soon as possible. However, she did not appreciate my
                  firmness and decision of character, but remained sulking in a corner of the
                  carriage during the whole of the next stage.
               Postillions are known to be scoundrels, but I think, on this unfortunate journey
                  of mine, I met with the most extortionate, and at the same time one of the most
                  impertinent, villains that ever was known. At one of the stations I had given a
                  postillion about twenty-five sous, instead of two or three francs, more than he
                  was entitled to claim from me.
               
               "They are not so loving as they were when they started," said the low brute, to
                  one of his companions. "He's actually only given me twenty-five sous."
               
                  
                     THE POSTILLION.
                  
               
               "Oh!" said the other, "what can you expect? some commercial traveller eloping with
                  a ballet girl."
               "There! there!" exclaimed Julia, who heard this last remark. "That's what I meet
                  with through you. Nothing but insults."
               "If we only had time to go back," I muttered, "I would break the scoundrel's
                  head."
               "Quarrelling would not improve the matter," remarked Julia.
               "No; but paying the fellows properly might. I shall pay the next by the legal
                  scale, not a farthing more."
               However, at the very next station, I had a row with the scoundrels. I paid them by
                  the legal scale, and you should have seen their looks. To make it better, there
                  were no horses to be had. An English lady had just passed with three travelling
                  carriages, one for herself and her lady's maid, another for her other servants,
                  and a third for her lap-dogs.
               "My aunt!" whispered Julia, quite pale from fear.
               "Well, my love," I replied, almost tired of her nonsense, "she's not running after
                  us, we're running after her; and as the laws of the road will not allow one
                  post-carriage to pass another, there is no fear of our overtaking her."
               "But she stops at Sens."
               "Well, Sens is not a village. It appears to be a large town. She puts up at the
                  Hôtel de l'Europe, and we can stop and dine at any hôtel that happens not to be
                  the Hôtel de l'Europe."
               "Dine!" muttered Julia contemptuously, as she threw herself back in the corner of
                  the carriage.
               However, I was not going to remain twenty-four hours without a regular meal for
                  the sake of a romantic young school-girl. Of course, I should be able to teach her
                  a little reason after our marriage, but in the meanwhile she was certainly
                  somewhat exacting. Nothing could stop the marriage now, not even her aunt, if her
                  carriage should break down, or any other accident should bring us into collision.
                  After passing Sens we should not even have to fear this. Her aunt was to sleep
                  there. We were only going to stop there an hour to dine—for I was determined to
                  have my dinner:—and the next morning, when the old woman started, we should be
                  eighty or ninety miles ahead.
               As Julia seemed seriously grieved, I thought I would try to console her. I began
                  by putting my arm around her waist, or rather by attempting to do so, for she drew
                  herself up quite furiously, and said, with a look of something very like scorn:
                  "Remember your promise, sir; and be good enough not to approach me so
                  closely."
               I tried to reason with her, but it was no use. Then I became sulky too, but only
                  for a few minutes, after which I amused myself by thinking what I should do with
                  the interest of the sixty thousand pounds.
               "I shall live in London," I decided, "in one of the new houses between
                  Knightsbridge and Kensington Gore, overlooking Hyde Park. I shall only want three
                  servants besides my own. Oh, yes—there's the cook, and we must have a good one
                  too, for I shall give a dinner party once a fortnight at least. With economy, we
                  shall be able to have a place in the country, and shall have enough for a foreign
                  trip every year. And I don't see why I shouldn't go to Parliament too. I can't
                  speak, but if I could manage to get a lucrative place I could receive the salary
                  just as well as any one else."
               These agreeable reflections were put an end to by the jerk of the carriage, which
                  suddenly stopped before the post-house of Sens.
               "Here we are," said I to Julia.
               "Here we are," I repeated, as I had received no reply.
               "Oh, my heaven! What is to become of me?" sighed Julia, who had been sleeping, and
                  was as yet scarcely awake.
               I was determined to put a stop to all this sort of thing, and said, rather
                  abruptly perhaps:
               "Have the kindness to get out. And remember we dine here."
               She got out without a word, and entered the hôtel. It was the Hôtel de France, the
                  Hôtel de l'Europe being, as I had ascertained, at the other end of the town.
               Julia's eyes looked hollow, and had large black circle round them. She had
                  evidently been crying much, and was quite exhausted.
               
               I really pitied her, and went towards her to speak to her, when she turned away
                  from me, took up a candlestick, and asked one of the servants to show her a room
                  where she could arrange her toilette.
               Soon afterwards the servant came down for a pen and ink.
               "A pen and ink! what for?" I inquired.
               "For Madam," she replied.
               I thought this rather odd, but ordered the dinner without troubling myself about
                  it.
               The soup was getting cold, and still Julia had not returned.
               "This shall not take place after we are married," said I to myself and began
                  eating.
               
                  
                     LOST—AN HEIRESS; FOR THE SAKE OF A DINNER!
                  
               
               "There you are at last," I exclaimed, as the door opened.
               But instead of Julia, an old lady entered.
               "You are Mr.——?" she began, mentioning my name.
               "Yes, Madam."
               "I am the aunt of the young lady who accompanied you here in a post-chaise," she
                  continued. "Julia missed me by one hour; and it was very kind of you to offer her
                  a place in your carriage. But as people might misinterpret the affair, I beg you
                  will never mention it, and I need not assure you we shall be equally discreet on
                  our side."
               "Madam, I do not understand you," I answered.
               "Read this letter, then," she replied, giving me a letter which Julia had just
                  sent her by one of the waiters.
               The letter was as follows:— 
                     
                        
                           
                              "MY DEAR AUNT,—I have behaved very shamefully, but you must pardon
                                 me. I left my school this morning with a man I thought I loved; but
                                 now that I have been a day in his society I
                                 detest him. Pray save me before it is too late.—
                              
                                 Your heart-broken niece,
                                 JULIA."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               I could not say a word—I was thunderstruck.
               "You will not mention this"—said the aunt, with a bow.
               "I mention it, Madam? I should think not, indeed. A nice fool I
                  should be considered," I reflected.
               "Because I have two sons, who are in the army," added the old lady, "and who are
                  very fond of Julia, and I should not like them to hear of it."
               "No threats are necessary, Madam—I shall not speak of the affair."
               "Excuse my having interrupted you," said the old woman; and with a very polite
                  bow, she left me.
               Thus ended my elopement, and my first and only attempt to get married on three
                  hundred a year.
            
            
               
                  
               
               HOW A STORY WAS FINISHED.
               SOME years ago a Cincinnati paper received and printed the first chapter of what
                  promised to be a thrilling romance, with the expectation tion of being provided with the concluding portions
                  as might be needed. The chapter was very ingeniously written, and concluded by
                  leaving the principal character suspended by the pantaloons from the limb of a
                  tree over a perpendicular precipice. It attracted the attention of the press, and
                  inquiries were about to be made concerning the continuation of the story and the
                  fate of the hero. Day after day the victimized publishers looked for the remaining
                  chapters, but in vain; they never came to hand. Finding that they had been sold,
                  and wishing to put a stop to the jokes their contemporaries were cracking at their
                  expense, they briefly concluded the story thus:
               Chapter II.—Conclusion. After hanging to the treacherous tree for four weeks, his
                  pantaloons gave way, and Charles Melville rolled headlong over the yawning
                  precipice. He fell a distance of five miles, and came down with the small of his
                  back across a stake, which so jarred him that he was compelled to travel in Italy
                  for his health, where he is at present residing. He is engaged in the butchering
                  business, and is the father of a large family of children.
            
            
               THE FROG.
               
                  OF all the funny things that live
                  In woodland, marsh or bog,
                  That creep the ground, or fly the air,
                  The funniest thing's the frog.
               
               
                  The frog—the scientificest
                  Of nature's handy-work,
                  The frog that neither walks nor runs,
                  But goes it with a jerk.
               
               
                  With pants and coat of bottle green,
                  And yellow fancy vest,
                  He plunges into mud and mire,
                  All in his Sunday best.
               
               
                  When he sits down he's standing up,
                  As Paddy O'Kinn once said;
                  And for convenience sake he wears
                  His eyes on the top of his head.
               
               
                  You see him sitting on a log,
                  Above the "vasty deep,"
                  You feel inclined to say "Old chap,
                  Just look out before you leap!"
               
               
                  You raise your cane to hit him on
                  His ugly-looking mug;
                  But ere you get it half way up,
                  Down he goes kerchug.
               
            
            
               A COLORED MINISTER'S ELOQUENCE.
               "My brudders," said a waggish colored man to a crowd, "in all infliction, in all
                  ob yer troubles, dare is one place you can always find sympathy!" "Whar? Whar?"
                  shouted several. "In de dictionary," he replied, rolling his eyes skyward.
            
            
               
               SOMETHNG ABOUT CRAVATS.
               
                  
               
               THE cravat changes with the age of the wearer. Before ten, our necks are free from
                  all incumbrance; up to eighteen the cravat is considered an object of utility;
                  from twenty to twenty-five it becomes an object of agreement, we seek to set off
                  our faces to the best advantage, and submit to the yoke with a light heart. At
                  thirty the cravat begins to be a study; at forty it becomes a task; its folds grow
                  ample and comfortable in their dimension—at this age we long for repose.
               
                  
               
               At this age our last pretensions to beauty, who do not survive its possesion more
                  than from twenty to thirty years, become quite extinct, and tho cravat may sit "as
                  Heaven pleases"—we heed it not; it collapses, and permits itself to be crushed
                  down by the stiff shirt collar, or metamorphoses itself into a sack, where we bury
                  both chin and mouth, sometimes the nose itself.
               
                  
               
               The shape, and color, and adjustment of the cravat, vary, then, with the age of
                  the wearer; but they also further vary with individual character and social
                  position.
               A pliable, soft, and loose cravat, negligently, yet not inelegantly tied, marks
                  out the man who knows how to enjoy life; a stiff cravat, tightly drawn, denotes
                  the man of dry humor, and the ill-tempered man who never sleeps well. The
                  physician in good practice, the successful artist, and the lawyer wear a cravat
                  tied in an unpretending way, without stiffness, or the least semblance of
                  dandyism.
               
                  
               
               Black-bearded men should all wear shirt-collars.
               Beware of the man who wears a rusty black velvet stock, exceedingly high, and
                  fastened behind with an immense black buckle. Be cautious how you speak in the
                  presence of such a man. Most likely he is a spy or an informer.
            
            
               TRYING TO GET AROUND A FEMALE.
               
                  ONE eve, in velvet bravery arrayed,
                  As Phil sat toying with his darling maid,
                  Her little buxom waist's bewitching charm
                  
                  The while half folded in his furtive arm;
                  He took her dimpled hand, and with a smile
                  Stealing it gently o'er the silken pile,
                  Asked, in a tender silence of love chat,
                  If palm e'er fondled aught so soft as that?
                  She archly answered, "Might I venture, pet,
                  I could press yours on something softer yet."
                  With sidelong glance of amorous mistrust
                  Adown the graceful neck and swelling bust,
                  Whose ermine cape, his darling fancy taught,
                  Was the coy "something" of the maiden's thought.
                  He fondly sighed, to fingers' ends a thrill,
                  "Ah! dearest, do!—my hand is at your will."
                  But O! lost rapture!—for no sooner said,
                  She gaily clapt it pat on his own head!
               
               
                  
                     "PLAYED OUT."
