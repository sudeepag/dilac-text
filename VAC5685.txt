               INTRODUCTORY.
               I AM not young, may be I am not old enough, to be indulged in the prosiness that I propose to treat you to "dear reader." You decide the age that will secure your extremest indulgence, and I will, without demur, confess to it. From the Atlantic side of the Rocky Mountains I write; for long years it has been my home. I do not care to be geographically definite. I should like to tell you of the fullness, the freedom of life here, of the goodness and the greatness in those about me, that have brightened and blessed me all along the course of my days. I could argue the case, or rather, I think you would willingly give to my dear West, all that I claim for it of promise and power, for my mind bows almost abjectly to New England standard, and my heart brims fuller and fuller of love for the "old rockbound," as the time stretches on that separates us. This is not what I want you to listen to now, even could you have such patience; I only want to explain why I came to enjoy so what I am about to tell, and even to fancy, these simple stories might interest others in a slight degree, as they have me.
               It was on this spot of earth, that I have not named,—where I am still resting, and where I shall finally peacefully sleep,—that some years ago, I was very busy one morning darning stockings, I believe, that I heard a call from my little daughter; I was not surprised, for I had a moment before been startled by an unmistakable ring at the street door.
               To those comforts, to those marvels of modern times,—express wagons and telegrams,—there has been vouchsafed, when they approach human habitations, a power of premonitory announcement peculiarly their own. So the shout I soon heard, did not astonish me. "Mamma, a box by express;" "from Salem, Mass., mamma," added my little Mamie, who could read very big letters. You may be sure, I was not long in treating my eyes to the sight of the new comer. Long years had rolled over my head, since I could call the dear old town my actual home; but every year that I had lived seemed to have made it dearer to me, and my children had grown up with the impression that it was a sort of outskirt of Paradise. Here was the box, a perfect "Poser." And I was quite as anxious as the children to see what was in it. I could bring no masculine strength or skill to my aid, my husband had gone to his day's work; what could I do. The box, as I inspected it—hoping for a loose place, cracked board, started or broken nail, to help me out of my trouble—I found to be much stronger, much more securely fastened than such boxes usually are. "Just the way they always do things in Salem," I said, in rather a doubtful tone of praise or blame. The fate of my express box, was to be one of those perpetually recurring illustrations of the truth of the old proverb, of "the will and the way." The judicious application of a small hatchet, with a very large tax upon my muscular power, brought off part of the cover, and then the task was comparatively easy; and in a very short time revealed its strange contents to our eager eyes—mine scarcely less wondering than the little girls. I carefully unpacked it. There was a large bundle, and a quaint-looking old cabinet. I recognized without difficulty the stiff round characters in which they were both directed; but I wondered still! "Miss Margaret Elton, to be sent to her by my executor." A line was passed through this (my maiden name), and in a plain, but rather trembling hand, my married one written above it. I untied the bundle, there was a queer-shaped old brocade sofa-cover, of a dingy brown and blue color, much faded and worn, it might have been bright and clean once; one big figure, seemed to disport itself all over it. My Edith, soon spied a small bit of yellow-looking paper closely sewed on one corner: "Made of a piece of one of Susannah English's dresses. See Antwerp Casket, key tied on left handle, turn key from right to left." Then there was a big faded green cushion, embroidered, with what had once doubtless been, very bright gold thread; attached to this, was another little explanatory patch: "Made of a waistcoat, once belonging to Philip English." Last of all, carefully wrapped, in that very clumsily water-lined, thin old paper, corresponding, I suppose, to the dainty silk tissue of our time, was a white silk apron and stomacher, and what looked more like a head-dress, than anything else, it was marked: "Part of Mary English's wedding suit, sent from London." This finished the bundle. How hastily I turned the rusty key, and opened the cabinet; there lay, directed to me, a letter; yes, a large, square-folded, old-fashioned letter, and two manuscripts, yellow, but not worn, but mottled with those snuff-colored and brown spots, the unmistakable signs of old age in these articles. The letter ran thus: 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "MY DEAR MARGARET:
                              
                              "When you see this, I shall be at rest. God knows how hard I have tried to be patient and wait His time; I have always loved you very much, and I leave you these things, because I think you will value and take care of them. I feel very glad to think that you will, when you read what is in this box, understand all. It has troubled me very much sometimes that I did not tell you; but dear Margaret, only he and I ever knew it, and he wanted it to be a secret between us till every body did. He had not quite finished, as you will see, writing the last tale. I had helped him. I mean, I had asked grandmother and Dr. Bentley a great many questions for him, copied some old records and letters for him. He meant Dr. Bentley should read both his tales before they were published, but you know how it all happened.
                              "How many years it was before I could look at the pages his dear hands had written. 'The Gold and Silver Cups' I always doubted about, I thought they might be one of his sweet fancies, until I really saw them. I know you wanted them, Margaret; you had a sort of right to them, for after I was gone, they would have come to your mother; but you must not think I did very wrong, I am sure you will forgive me now, I did what I know he would have done with them. I hope you will be very happy. My dear child, I know we shall meet again in heaven.
                              
                                 "URSULA HILLSWORTH."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               There was something on the other side of the page. I turned it. These words were written in a much older, and more trembling hand: 
                     
                        
                           
                              "I am very glad to have seen and known your husband; you will be very happy. If you should ever have a little boy, will you name him Edmund?
                              
                                 U. H."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               What a record! what a revelation was here! My tears fell hot and fast, to think that "the all" of her life's experience, liable to my misunderstanding, could I have known it, when her heart was keeping its long vigil of love and faith, I could not have found words or thoughts tender enough to have administered to her. How glad I was that I had always really loved her. I seized the old manuscripts, they were very clearly and delicately written. Of course my stockings were forgotten, my dinner was hastily swallowed, the children felt themselves entirely neglected, and when my husband came home, he was not only somewhat startled by my avalanche of talk, but by the ante-revolutionary colonial New England style, into which I occasionally fell. Before I ask you to read these productions which interested me so intensely, I will tell you something about them, and my association with them. They were sent to me by the Executor of Miss Ursula Hillsworth, a very old gentlewoman of Salem. She must have been more than ninety. A few months before, I had been deeply grieved to hear of her death. This was a most unexpected result from it. She was hardly a relative, though we might have claimed cousinship, three or four generations old, but her preferred association with my family was an entirely sentimental one. She had been engaged to my granduncle Edmund Elton; who had died, leaving her at eighteen with a wound in her heart that time had, never healed, and a memory, that seemed to make to her all of life's brightness. I was very much touched with such a proof as she had given me of her love and confidence; had she had millions, she had given me what she valued most on earth. As for her worldly effects, the small competence upon which she lived was only a life estate, which, at her death, was divided between the "First Church" and the "Old Marine Society," two most worthy objects,—favorite recipients of many of the earnings and hoardings, as well as the spare cash, of most of Salem's old worthies of the last century. I am always told, I do not know when to stop upon a Salem topic. So to give Philip English's "Cups " and my granduncle's romance-writing powers any chance, I will, as briefly as I can, tell you how it happened that I can lay before you some points bearing on the narratives; for old Miss Ursula's strange bequest, recalled in almost microscopic detail an entirely forgotten episode of my early life. Here I will say that I have have been obliged to fill some gaps, change some dates in these pages. Ursula, perhaps, would have thought it sacrilege. You may mark some passages more tiresome or awkward than others, and detect some clumsy linking. Set it all down to me. One tale seems to be told by an old relative to a young listener; the other, addressed to maturer thought. I give them to you very nearly as I found them. Now for my own part of their history.
               
               I must have been about sixteen years old, when one very pleasant afternoon in spring found me started with full purpose, and the pleasant prospect of a long walk before me. "Beverly Bridge," the "Danvers Graveyard," "Dark Lane," or "North Fields," all favorite haunts for Salem walkers, might have seen me that afternoon; but at one of the most unrural points (let me coin the word) in the whole town,—the dusty corner of Brown and St. Peter's Streets,—I stopped, and there lingered until long after dark. Let me tell you what kept, me. How well I remember it all now; I dare say you will wish that my memory was not so good, or that I had a better faculty of condensing. Let me not injure my departed ancestor's only chance for literary fame; treat this as a sort of preface, to be read or not, only be just to him.
               The workmen were digging at the corner of these streets, to lay the foundations of a new church; the palings protecting the old grave-yard, were all down. I wandered in, where I had so often peeped, trying to read the old inscriptions there; and after straying about for some time, I seated myself on the slab, "Sacred (I think) to the Memory of the Rev. William Fisher," to watch, as entirely idle people very often do, very busy ones; and there never was a better chance. I never saw people harder at work; the men were all straining, tugging, belaboring with pick-axes, shovels, crow-bars, what seemed an unmovable piece of masonry I never saw redder faces, or more distorted mouths. I don't know how long either their lungs and arms, or the stones, could have borne such work; but fortunately the master-mason (I suppose) came up, and with a few blows, under his direction, the heavy stones loosened, parted, and one of them rolled on the ground; there was a sort of huddle round the hole, and I heard them say, "It must have been a grave." "What's this?" said one of the men; and he pulled out two or three long, black, rotten sticks. "It's the coffin, and there's a bit of the plate sticking to this piece," and he handed it to the mason. By this time I had come as near to the place as I could get. I was always a sort of "Old Mortality," and this was entirely to my taste. "Here, Miss Margaret," said the mason, giving it to me, "see if your bright eyes can't make out what this is, it does look to me like letters." He rubbed it with his apron. "I can't quite make it out." "I can," I said, as soon as I looked at it; "It's P. E. or B. E., I think." "Well, we sha'n't be left thinking or guessing long, I'll warrant, for here comes Eben Saunders, he'll tell; maybe he knows who was buried here." Winking at me, at what he thought a great joke.
               Mr. Saunders came quickly up to where we were standing. The prediction proved true; in a trice, his brightest magnifiers were on (he always had three grades about him), and he exclaimed with delight, "P. E., as plain as the nose on my face!" and that was very plain. He looked, and made a very rapid, but scrutinizing survey of the ground about him. "Why, to be sure! that stands for Philip English; this must be his grave. I always knew he must be buried in this corner. William Fieldfair, lived and died, insisting that his grave must be under the west side, because the English pew was there."
               Then I feared that Mr. Saunders, much as he seemed to venerate this Philip English, would dispossess him of his last resting-place, or would pay him the tribute of expiring there, he thrust his head in,—it appeared peared to me he tried to get his whole body in,—this he found to be 
                     impossibe
                     impossible
                  ; he picked up a pickaxe, and continued his investigations. He pulled out a mass of rubbish, and with his thribble eyes, he quickly detected, what one can rarely mistake—a human bone. He carefully separated it from the dirt clinging to it.
               "I wonder if Mr. Burton is about here," he said. "He generally is," replied one of the workmen, who were patiently digging on. "Mr. Burton!" he bawled. He was the old sexton, and very deaf; but he was soon seen emerging from the only vestige of the old edifice, a very small modern appendage to it, which had of late years been appropriated as the Rector's study. He came up, but was very much flurried and annoyed, that an event like this should have taken place, and he not by. A few loudly screeched words, put him in most satisfactory possession of the case. Both now worked in perfect harmony, and in apparent familiarity with what was before them. They vied with each other in respect for the many bones which their united efforts, with great care, drew from their long resting-place. A small wooden box beside them, was nearly full, and they had both decided that they had got all they could. Eben was dexterously sweeping, for the last time, the long narrow space; we all heard a rattle, and the reappearing broom brought with it two very black-looking cups, or goblets, un-like, but of antique shape. I will not attempt to describe the expression of either of those faces, though I can see them both now.
               "Don't this beat all, Mr. Burton!" cried Mr. Saunders. Mr. Burton's expression fully indicated that he considered "all" beaten. "'Pears though I had heerd a sight about them English's that was very strange like, but I don't know that ever I heerd anything mentioned like this 'ere. I have heard father say when the old pew was shifted, about sixty years ago, that if them that owned it once had had their rights, the pew would have been sot up right in the broad isle. And my mother would say, 'Now, Bishee, that's what I call worshipping. She was a Parkins, you know, and very pious.'"
               The garrulous old man was meandering on, while Mr. Saunders was busy with the cups; it was evident that to them he wished to give his undivided attention. Whether he found it impossible wholly to withdraw his mind from the details of events fifty years old, or whether he had been so very often treated to this strain, and so wearied, I know not; but with great tact he managed to secure the silence, and absorb the faculties of the old sexton, and that, too, in a way most delightful to him.
               "I think it will be best for you to take charge of these relics, and find a suitable place for them, until 'the vestry' can decide as to their final disposition. I shall take the cups to the Senior Warden. I suppose he will turn them over to you. I must call a vestry meeting to-morrow," he added, rather to himself.
               The suggestion to Mr. Burton took immediate effect. It seemed to me he was endeavoring to reproduce the pomp and circumstance of an ancient funeral. I know not what temporary sanctuary was chosen for the remains; but we heard no more of old time discourse, and left the devotee, when the sun was nearly down, still busy. After mercilessly sacrificing two large bandana handkerchiefs in rubbing, or rather, scouring the cups, Mr. Saunders was able to make out a great deal about them; though he seemed to feel that he was groping in the dark. In the first place, he was sure one was gold, the other silver. "See!" said he, delightedly, holding the gold one before my eyes; "here is a coat of arms, quite plain, too; Scotch, I think, for that looks like a thistle." I did not know what the scratches looked like, and could give no opinion. But I could read plainly on the silver cup: "Philip and Susannah English, 1693." And I received without any doubting, my companion's almost ecstatic exclamation mation, "As I'm alive, here's the old arms of the town of Salem! With such a clew as this, I am sure we can make out this case." Whether he ever did, I know not. I would I could enlighten him entirely now. Why should I wish this? He surely has passed to far better things.
               I never heard into whose possession fell, what must have been, a most valuable collection of papers and records. Peace and respect to his memory! He was an honorable, high-minded man, an amiable and delightful gentleman! One thing he told me to do, just before we parted,—I, feeling if I had not had my walk, I had very much enjoyed the afternoon' occupation,—he, probably to deposit his treasure at the Senior Warden's. "Let Miss Ursula Hillsworth know about this; perhaps she can tell something about it. I rather think she's nearer kin to the English's than any one in town. I must find out, for I must be able to advise the vestry," he added.
               You may be sure I lost no time in making known all that I had seen to Miss Ursula. I made my story much shorter than I have made it to you. Impressing as a leading fact, the beauty and value of the cups; and stating, as a very strong individual opinion, that "I thought she ought to have them." "Oh! how I wish I could; I must see them," she said; "I would give anything for them—I would. I know what I would do with them." I can remember her expression, it only flitted over her old face. The light in her eyes looked almost like youth; very strange was the quiver about her mouth—in a moment it had passed away. "You would give them to the Historical Society, I dare say; and I think you ought to keep them." "I should not," she solemnly said. I was wholly puzzled by her manner; but I was determined that she should at least see the cups. I had many plans to bring this about, but acted upon my first scheme, a sort of cross between an appeal and an attack upon Mr. Burton. Why Miss Ursula did not send to him, or Mr. Saunders, I could not see. In fact, I was bewildered by what she said and did. I had never known her so confused and unsatisfactory before; this worked with my own interest to make me all the more earnest in the matter. I was a great favorite with Mr. Burton, owing to a resemblance which he thought he saw in me to my great-grandmother, I believe. Good old soul! he neither fancied nor uttered much that was not good of anybody, and this is saying a great deal; since his range of observation gave three generations a pretty good survey and sifting. He was a bachelor. I don't remember that at the time that I am writing of, he had a single relative living, but he enjoyed the respect of the whole town, and the services of a very active colleague. And he considered it the crowning act of his life, training one, whom he confidently thought, would in time be wholly competent to fill his place. He was both magnanimous and hopeful. When he expressed himself, as he frequently did, in relation to his associate: "Werry likely; does remarkable for such a youngish man." The pupil was well towards fifty.
               In my usual style of Salem narration, I shall be giving both his and Mr. Burton's biography. When my proposed interview with the latter, and its results, is all you can reasonably be expected to listen to. I bespoke your extremest indulgence,—you see how needful it is.
               Well! I found him just where I thought I should, hovering and crooning over the church treasures that were, in the unsettled condition of affairs, crowded into the Rector's old study for safe keeping. I stepped in without knocking. He looked over his perfectly round, heavily iron-bowed spectacles (they were his week-day ones; on Sunday his face was adorned with a very large silver pair; his nose must have felt the day "no day of rest"). I well remember the funny mixture of frown and smile that greeted my entrance, he was daintily dusting the old tablets of Decalogue, Lord's Prayer and Creed, paying special attention to the burnished gilt edges, and the almost bursting faces of the cherubs, that decorated them. "Now, what do you want, Margaret Elton; I am most beat out; they've locked up them cups. You're after them, I'll be bound; that is, if Mr. Saunders 'aint took 'em," he said, half pettishly. "I knew you would know all about them, and that I must come to you to find out. What care you do take of everything here. How beautifully those tablets look, I never knew they were so handsome before," I said. He was softening, I could see. He replied, "'Aint they handsome when you git nigh 'em? I can't really say I've been able to read 'em this long time afore they were took down, though I knowed what was on 'em; but after I'd rubbed and iled them a little. the letters stood out beautiful. I don't 'bleeve but what folks tother end of the church will be able to fowler every word, if they will only have good clear glass in the east winders, but they do talk of something very different," he said, with a sigh. "There's been folks here from New York, and our westry has talked a sight about what they call colored glass; maybe it would n't show dirt, but 'pears to me it would make the building werry dark."
               I had prepared for a long job. The end seemed not only doubtful, but very far off; there was no time to be lost, an effective blow must be struck, and at once.
               "Mr. Burton, I should like very much to see those cups;" audaciously, I added: "I do wish you would let me take them and just show them to Miss Ursula Hillsworth." He looked perfectly amazed. "How did that old maid find out all that's been a-going on in our westry? they only had their meeten last night. Old maids does find out everything. But I 'aint no authority to let her have 'em now, you tell her so. I hope she won't feel any ways ugly, because I did n't want her to have them; 'taint been as I said. I knowed she was kin to Philip English somehow, and her folks once owned the big square pew in the west corner there." He looked towards a point in mid air, entirely unmarked now, but the material shape once standing there was permanently daguerreotyped on his mind's eye. He could not so soon speak of it as a thing that was. "When the pews first was shifted, her father gave up the title, I've heerd father say. They made three wall-pews of it, the old man took one; arter he died, they put in the slips, and she never took one; she was getting old, and weakly like. Now you see my notion about them cups was: our westry is a-going to put up a tablet to Philip English, and them cups would pretty nigh pay for it. As they had been in the airth almost two hundred years, and as he was n't Miss Ursula's grandfather, nor 'nothin like that, I thought it was foolish like for our westry not to sell 'em. Mr. Sketchly, says they're the best of metal. They passed the vote only last night that she should have them. Now, how did she find it out so soon?" He was so interested that he did not stop for any answer. I was so delighted, I was willing to listen two hours' longer. I wanted, to know the particulars, and felt I could in the main, have no better narrator rator. "You see, Eben Saunders offered the resolution, and said a sight afore the westry about Philip English a giving this 'ere land we're a sitting on and the glebe opposite; he got all that from my father afore he died. I've see him write after him when he was a talking; but how he picked it out, and fixed it so straight about Ursula's kin, I don't see. I should hate to know as much as he does about folk's folks; away back; it has, I know, give him some trouble. Once he had to go to Ipswich about Squire Epes' woodland; they could n't do nothing under the sun with the metes and bounds without him. And he's been plagued in other ways, I know. He used to pester me most to death when he was a young man, working with them parish books," and Mr. Burton pointed to a big heap in one corner. "He marked some of them, but I never made no fuss about it. He was a clever, but queer man. Well, you see, he laid this 'ere afore the westry, and then put the vote: 'That Ursula Hillsworth should have them cups.' Mr. Nevins always favors our old church folks, you know; the Rector went with him. Mr. Stevens and Mr. Pullin told me, they never thought about the tablet until I mentioned it. So the vote was carried. And Ursula's got them cups, or as good as got them, for Mr. Saunders was appointed to give them to her. I'm sure I don't begrudge 'em to her. You tell the old lady I've cleaned 'em up well for her; but don't mention to her all I've said. In the first part of Mr. Fisher's time, we sat in the seats together; 't was long afore we had Dr. Oliver's organ, and when they could n't make but dreadful little noise with the old one. I should n't like to have her think I was any ways ugly about it." I promised that his part in the business, that could in any way be construed into a want of proper respect for the representative of the defunct proprietors of the large square pew, or to Miss Ursula in her most bird-like days, should be kept a dead secret. And so we parted.
               Rejoiced as I was, that all had gone better than I ever dreamed of, I was a good deal more than half glad that town talk with the rumor, and Mr. Saunders with the wonderful realities, had both reached Miss Ursula before I did. I don't think it was the mystery about these cups, I'm sure it was n't poor Burton's qualms, but I felt then that there was an unexplainable something in Miss Ursula's association with them that made her manner so strange, and seemed to have such an effect upon her, that though I was too glad she was to have them, I was rejoiced I had not to tell her of her good fortune. Now how plain it all is! Scene the last, for the lovely old goblets above ground appeared then, scene the strangest. Yes! there they were in Miss Ursula's own room, in Miss Ursula's own hands, as bright and beautiful as they could be! I remember turning my back once, and being sure I saw her kiss them. "They are lovely," I said, as we both sat looking at them. "Yes," she replied, "Mr. Saunders is coming for them to-morrow. Your mother was here yesterday afternoon, and saw them. She does not care for old things, Margaret, does she?" "No, not much," I replied; "but how could you let Mr. Saunders persuade you to give them to the Historical Society." I was wofully disappointed, for I wanted her to keep them, but I managed to add, cheerfully: "I knew you would; I dare say it is all for the best." "Margaret," she said, so sadly and so solemnly, that I was awed at once; "Back in the earth, where they have so long lain they must go; I cannot rob the dead. With the bones of Philip English, that are to be treated with all respect, they are again to be buried; and I hope, forever."
               I did not say one word. Could I have analyzed what I felt, the master-element would, I think, have been pity. At any rate, to Miss Ursula's very strange decision, as it seemed then, I gave an acquiescence which was most acceptable to her, and to everybody body in the town who chose to criticise, condemn, or laugh at, either "that old maid's folly, wrong-doing, or ugliness," as it was alternately called. I had answers, which I hope nobody remembers, for I know they were often very silly, and I fear, sometimes very uncivil. For, if what she did, gave her any pleasure, my strongest feeling was, that I was very glad she was able to do it. How it all comes back to me now! How plain it all is! How sad it is! Will you read the sequel to this very tiresome introduction?
            
            
               
               PHILIP ENGLISH'S GOLD CUP.
               (My granduncle's earliest dated manuscript.)
               "SIT by me, dear Elsie, and listen while I read to you the story of my grandfather's and grandmother's early life. I have done as you asked me, written it for you; it cannot be to you, as it was to me, told by loving lips, felt by noble, loving hearts. But before I am gone, I am sure it is best that I should give you something, to tell you how good and true they were, something of their joys and of their sorrows."
               Gladly the maiden seated herself by the old man's side, and he began.
               "Philip English was the son of an English gentleman, and was born about the year 1645; his ancestors had for many generations lived and died on a pleasant estate in one of the northern counties of England. His mother was a Scotch lady; I have seen a picture of her, a sweet, sunny face, with fair, clear skin and fine blue eyes. I remember well its quaint setting of red gold, with a coat of arms engraved on the back. Philip had one brother, Walter, who was two years older than himself. Those two years! how Philip had felt, as long as he could remember, the difference those two years made between them; they seemed to give to Walter the powers and privileges almost of a higher order of being. Very different were those two boys; they rarely quarreled, nor could one say they did not love each other, but there was a distance between them. Their father, Roger English, after their mother's death (she died when very young), led a very quiet, retired life. Truly he was stricken to his heart's core with grief. Feeling sure for all the needs of their childhood, their old Scotch nurse, Margery, could provide better than he, he saw little of his sons; and for the 'brave laddies,' as 'Margie' called her pets, the blithe, gay Scotchwoman was a fitter companion than the sad, grave gentleman, who, though he always spoke kindly, rarely smiled. Philip and Walter hardly stretched their rambles, for sport or any other purpose, much beyond their own acres, and had few companions outside the household. Roger's household since his majority had known little change, his lot had been orphanage; not like his sons, he could just remember his father's dying blessing. And there was hardly a person in the parish who could not tell some tale of his tender care of his mother, who died just before he came of age. Most of the retainers at the 'Manor House' felt there could be no worthier employment in lift than watching and amusing the boys, promoting their sports with their few companions, the children of the neighboring families, and seeing that in ducking, swimming, shooting, no harm befell them.
               "So passed their early days away. Three successive curates had taught them, and that, too, (without a very frequent application of birch,) to such a point of classic attainment and general scholastic lore, that the 'Old Parish Priest,' after what he thought a very thorough examination, in answer to Roger's earnest, and rather troubled questions tions, when the boys were sixteen and eighteen, pronounced them ready for the university. So they were started off under the care of old Gilbert and Hubert, two of the most venerable and dignified of the household adjuncts, for Cambridge. How old Margery went on in the servants' hall the night of their departure, it was the second journey of any importance that she had ever known anything of. About her first, she rehearsed for about the thousandth time, to willing listeners, (after drinking 'His Worship's and the wee ones' health,) how the Squire had brought her sweet, bonnie Lady Letitia fra' her Highland home, to his own fair lands,' and 'she left behind her,' Margery would say, 'many a young Hieland laird, who must have sighed when the "fairest of lassies" was pledged, even if he shouted and tossed his bonnet. But it was naught but blessings she brought with her, the dear, the dear—' the old woman always added; big tears rolling down her old wrinkled face.
               "The university days were, to our young heroes, what they were to most boys of that period, or any other; they were days of sometimes study, sometimes idleness; visits home, with their days of shooting and other sports; visits to the clergyman; Margie's sly pettings and coaxings, plum-puddings and every dainty the old soul could think of.
               "At last these days were over. And Philip and Walter were settled once more under the paternal roof. Roger was obliged to confess that they were grown; he was not a little troubled by this fact. What should he do with them!—more especially Philip. To Walter, he could, he must, whether he would or not, say, 'All that I have is thine.' Would Philip, his high-spirited Philip, ever be contented with the small Scotch estate that came to him by his mother? Must he not be fitted for service in the Church, or in the State? So long had Roger English dozed his life away amid those quiet hills, that the thought of the responsibilities that all these issues brought to him, was a sore burden. Under his very eyes, and he knew it not, his sons were shaping their own destiny.
               "I cannot tell you how it was, Elsie, but both Philip and Walter fell in love with almost their earliest playmate, their father's nearest neighbor's only daughter, the sweet Susannah Hollingsworth, and 'Matin Hill,' her father's seat, with its fair gardens and all its flowery borders, knew not a lovelier flower. She was like themselves, motherless; and had seemed to every one like a sister to them. Terrible was the night when each learned the other's secret. For Philip had to hear from Walter's lips, that Susannah had promised to marry no man but him. And Walter had to see a look of hopeless love, and hear despairing words from the proud, gay Philip: 'We must part forever, brother,' said Philip; 'I shall go to the New World, I shall never seek my home here again, or see my father's face. Walter, for God's sake, for your own, be kind and true to her, and may God be with you both! His blessing and her love is enough for any mortal man.'
               "So said Philip English on that terrible night, when he knew that the hopes he had cherished as long as he could remember, must die, and die forever. 'Brother,' said Walter, 'I will do all I can for you. Is it not best that not to our father, not to Margery, should aught be known, save that you will seek your fortune in the New World. I don't think he will deny you, brother. He will grieve at first, say it is all Dame 
                     Slearforth's
                     Stearforth's
                   pious chat, and bid the priest and curate talk to you. Must it be so, Philip? Will you go?' and he suddenly started, as he laid his arm on his brother's neck. Was it that he saw in the light of the rising moon, that just now looked through the casement into the hall where the brothers sat, the ashen hue of Philip's face, or did he catch the look on his dead mother's face, for in that light her sweet eyes seemed to gaze mournfully from her picture on her sorrowing ing son. Something oppressed and awed him; he turned, and said, in a quiet, humble tone, 'Can you not go to your own "Burnie side," Philip, and will not time ease your grief? Our father has said more than once, it was a fit home for an English squire, and many a doughty Raeburn had lived there, with more followers about him, than an English knight can muster now. It's all your own, Philip. And you shall not lack gold to make it all you could wish.'
               "One look told Walter English that he could not plan for his brother. And slowly and sadly came the words, that haunted Walter to his dying day.
               "God only knows how I suffer. I thank Him, that I can suffer alone, and thank you for all that you would do for me, brother. You can, you must do much. Smooth my way with my father. Sell my Highland lands for me; let the agony of my stay here be short. I will before to-morrow's sun sets, write to our father's London kinsman, that he will, as soon as may be, bespeak a passage in the first ship sailing for Virginia. You and he can send me all that is mine.'
               "All this was settled that very night. At last the brothers parted. Philip, to throw himself under the beeches, where his careless feet had so often strayed; and Walter, to his quiet chamber; but with a shadow on his brow, that would never pass away, and a fiend in his heart, that would never give him any peace. One of these men was weak, the other strong. Walter English knew that Susannah loved Philip, and not him. And he knew that a lie, believed by both, was all that could separate them. And he had dared to tell it. There were but a few hours left of the peace and darkness of the night, when the brothers slept. As the morning sun began to streak the east, and smile on the 'Old Manor House,' they rose, each with a settled purpose in his heart. One was for good; the other for evil, evil continually.
               "In a few weeks all was arranged. A passage was secured by the London cousin in a comfortable ship bound for Virginia. Philip had few words for any one, and allowed himself but one interview with Susannah, a seemingly accidental one. The astonishment at such a push in 'young Philip English,' soon died away. As to Roger, all that Philip said, could not take from him Walter's comforting assurance, so warily given: 'Dear father, don't cross him; 'twill only fix him in this strange whim. If he is only let to go in peace, and with your blessing, he'll be back with us before the grain is twice reaped.'
               "So Roger bid him 'God speed,' laid his hands on his chestnut curls, and blessed him. He did not know how much he loved him until that moment. How like a heavenly dream in weary, anxious days, long after, came to Philip the recollection of that tender benediction. Old Margery cried aloud, when she found the voyage to Virginia was really to be undertaken. She could not part with her 'ain bairn, her ain wee Philip.' Of Walter's part she dreamed not; but her quick, mother-wit, sharpened by her strong love, told her that her 'brave laddie' had some heavy heart secret. So when Philip, as gayly as he could, as much like his old self as possible, just before he sailed, said to her: 'Margie, you must take care of my Gold Cup, my Raeburn Beaker' (it had come to him as the youngest from a long line of old Raeburns). He thought he had prized it very much! It did not seem to him he clung much to anything now! 'Margie,' he continued, for Margie had made him no answer; 'I think after I am gone, you had better, I wish you would, give that cup to her who will be Walter's wife, Susannah Hollingsworth. My mother loved her, you used to tell me, and would call her her poor motherless lamb, when we were both wee ones; so I 'll leave it with her, methinks, Margie.' 'And its wi' your sel' it should be, and not wi' wat, for ye're a Raeburn every bit o' ye; and its bairns of ye're own should drink fra' it, my own darling.' The look on her darling's pale face, told Margery all she had partly guessed.
               "She took the cup, and it was through her, the true-hearted old soul, that evil was turned to good.
               "Walter, after his wicked lie to Philip, tried by every artful speech, a word here, a look there, to make Susannah believe that Philip had followed to the new country Dame Stearforth's niece; who had, with her father, sailed more than a year before for America.
               "Philip, in truth, had only seen her a few times. Knew nothing of her fate; and we know, cared nothing, except to wish her well, doubtless, if he ever thought of her.
               "Not long after Philip had gone, Margie sought Susannah to give her the cup. And somehow between these two women, who loved him best on earth, a right understanding came. Each found out, before very long, what was uppermost in the other's heart. To Margie's eagerly listening ear, came these precious words: 'How could he leave me, when I would have died with him, or for him!' Margie got the parish clerk to write a letter to Philip; which, between her love and pride, and his want of skill, was so confused, that I don't think even Philip could have made much out of it, except that he was to come home at once. Philip never got it. Before it left England, he had decided to leave Virginia and go to Massachusetts.
               "But stranger than this. Susannah's father, who was, as I have told you, a strange man, had made up his mind to go to America. He openly declared he was displeased with the condition of Church and State, and would end his days in another realm. And when it was afterwards known, that he had had long disputes with the old parson, and did not go to church even on Easter Sunday, no one seemed to wonder at all at it. Susannah must have felt that she should at least be in the same country with her dear Philip.
               "At last the Hollingsworths sailed. I don't know how long the voyage was, many were the perils; but 'twas into our own harbor at last they came, in safety and great joy.
               "Who do you think was one of the first persons that put his foot on the deck of that little craft, little dreaming of what awaited him? Why, Philip English! We cannot tell what a ship from England was to the dwellers in this town was then; but we can all feel what it might be, to have the greatest sorrow we had ever known, turned into the greatest joy we had ever hoped for!
               "'Susannah English!' cried Philip, 'I am your Walter's brother Philip, Philip English! and you do not know me.' 'I am Susannah Hollingsworth, and not your brother Walter's wife,'. she answered. Oh! the blessed blindness, the numbness, so tenderly sent, that we may not see and feel all at once, when such a crisis comes.
               "You know the end. Philip and Susannah were married, and they lived in this very house, their true, noble, loving lives.
               "The silver cup, about which I may sometime tell you, is a memorial of some of their shady days. You know they had sorrows as well as joys.
               "You will not, I think, wonder that the command of Philip's will, written on stiff, yellow vellum was strictly obeyed. 'Item: It is my will that "ye Gold Beaker, called ye Raeburn Beaker," together with my silver goblet, standing by its side on the buffet in my dining-hall, be put in my coffin, and interred with me.'
               "Now, Elsie, take a run in the Lady English's flower-patch; and ask some of the daisies and violets, if their great-grandmothers ever told them aught of the Lady Susannah's lovely face, or of her watchful care and training!"
            
            
               
               THE SILVER CUP.
               A TALE OF NEW ENGLAND WITCHCRAFT.
               (My granduncle's last dated and most unfinished manuscript.)
               NEARLY a score of years had passed over Philip and Susannah English, since the "Golden Beaker" was filled to pledge the guests, at their joyous bridal. Very few changes had their lives known, under their own roof-tree. They had only one child, Mary; very lovely she was. At the time I write of, she was about eighteen. Richard Hollingsworth, now, truly "the old man," was "still alive." Once during all these years, Philip had been to England. Once and for the last time, had he wandered under the beech-trees of his early home—mused, it may be; sighed in the "Old Manor House" (now owning another race); it was with no heart-breaking sigh, for his heart's home was far beyond the broad blue waters. A leaf in life's book was turned there, and closed by Philip forever. Often he might read it in memory's softening light with smiles and tears. God's judgment he knew, must terribly illuminate it for his eyes to look upon, but could that bring to him aught but that most blessed human consciousness, self-mastery, complete and direst temptations trampled under its feet. The battle fought then, seemed to have brought to Philip a long and almost perfect peace. For many years his life had been so ordered that neither his anxieties, fears nor hopes, stretched beyond the reach of his personal watchfulness and care. Roger English had long slept with his fathers; and Walter had died, blessing Philip and loving him, because he knew him better than he ever had in their early days. Poor Walter! whose punishment had followed so certainly, so swiftly upon his sin. Baffled, beaten, maddened, he had at first plunged into a wild career, and then all the heart that was left in him, was broken by his worldly, unloving wife, who had married his acres and not him. But sorrow and sin had so broken him down that the laburnums had scarce twice bloomed, owning the haughty Lady Maud mistress at the "Manor House," ere Walter slept by his father's side. So all the links that bound Philip to his native land were broken. The good "London cousin," whose quick wit and honest heart had made unthrifty, uncaring Roger, rich, had long before ceased to turn the pages of his well-worn ledgers, and vanished from the "stock exchange." Philip had learned in the New World, Trade and its kindred Thrift; he could easily manage the large means that came to him. Some was left safely in London, all was made available. It would have rejoiced the old Londoner's heart to have known that Roger English had such a son. Not quite, indeed, would Philip have come up to his standard of a full appreciation and application of his favorite adage, "a penny saved, is a penny got," but for a "Somerset English," he would have been to the old man a perfect wonder. Well was it that Philip had learned all this, for he found himself in his maturer life, richer far than he had ever dreamed of being or cared to be in his early manhood; in ease and comfort his days passed smoothly by. Little thought he or Susannah of the breakers before them, in which they should be so wildly tossed. Their hearts rejoiced, and joyfully, they thanked God for His abounding mercies.
               It was the summer of 1691; the long June twilight was fast fading, the darkness of the summer night (which is not gloom) had come, as Philip and Susannah English drove slowly toward their home. Susannah had been spending a long day at Salem Village, with the Rev. Mr. Parris and his godly household; glad were they to near the cheerful lights of their own dwelling. The visit had been more exciting than agreeable. Susannah had gone for ghostly counsel, and to give and receive comfort. She had suffered all day long from what she had seen, and the spirit she found reigning there, disturbed and half affrighted her. Mr. Parris' views of the witchcraft proceedings which blackened the already agitated atmosphere, made most unwelcome suspicions deepen into convictions, and these strong convictions made her distrust and almost dislike, those whom she had both pitied and loved. It was with a sense of real relief that she greeted Philip, who arrived late in the afternoon, to take her home. And he was all alone, too, she rejoiced to see; so that the presence of Cæsar, Cato or Pompey would not interrupt their chat during their drive to Salem. Partly with that intuitive delicacy which always lead him to avoid before those to whom they had been denied, a display of the gifts of fortune, and partly that he dearly loved a quiet drive with his wife, it was that all alone, in a shabby, old carriage, and not in his bright London chariot, Philip English drove up to the Parson's door.
               The door had scarcely closed behind them, the kindly partings had hardly died away, when Susannah began a sort of half expostulation with herself, a half confession and appeal to Philip. "Philip," she said, "these witchcraft-doings are growing frightful and terribly wicked, I think. I know not where or how they will ever end. Mr. Parris seems to fear that Satan is bodily to destroy God's work among us. Methinks, he would fain use means like his own to prevail against him. He says that imprisonments, torture, and even death, should be dealt without mercy to those who would league themselves with the fiend. How can these strangely afflicted children point out who are Satan's followers? I could talk but little with them. He told me that Dr. Cotton Mather, and many of our most learned clergy, think just as he does."
               "These things are passing strange," said Philip. "Do you remember Margie's stories of the Highland wizards, Susannah? I remember how scared I used to be after her tales of coffins, skulls, shrouds, that they could plainly see hanging over people, who were sure to die within a twelvemonth. And one saw a man in grave-clothes sitting by old Hugh, her father, just a twelvemonth and a day before he died. Why, the rattle of the frosted holly-bushes on the lawn frightened me! And I got this broken limb of mine, falling from terror at the sight of one of our big white ewes that got tangled in a thorn-bush. I thought it must be a ghost. I was terribly ashamed; I believe I never before told any one about it. Now this witchcraft is just the same thing." "I remember it all now," replied Susannah, "but I never could see the halt, so many said they could, so long after you got well. I remember the surgeon that came from London, and all Margie's plasters." "I don't think," said Philip, "I ever smell a primrose, Susannah, that I don't think of those you used to pull and bring to me." "But, Philip, about these wizards and their sights. Mr. Brampton and the curate, they were very angry with Margaret for her "folly," as they called it, and her old Highland visitors had little peace, and staid not long with us. They bade us children say our prayers and mind our catechisms, and the devil would in no shape come near us." "Let us do so now," replied Philip; "we can do nothing wiser or better."
               Then they fell into their accustomed easy talk about old home days, never with more calming effect; a peace like that which rested on all around them, was in their hearts, as they stood on the threshold of their sumptuous, well-ordered home. "Let us say little of these things save to each other, Susannah," said Philip; pausing on the door-step, as if to leave the whole matter in the veritable "outer darkness." A delicate hand was laid on Philip's broad shoulders. His moods were often restrained, his words often smoothed, by the touch of those slight, taper fingers. Who has not responded to hand-appeal and hand-eloquence? Philip turned, and beheld a face full of pity, and instinct with power. "Shall we not own what we believe? Comfort those that are in bitter sorrow?—do what we think is right?" "Susannah," he said, kissing her hand tenderly, as he drew it within his own, and led her in; "we will both try to do all this; but let us be prudent, for these are sadly troublous times."
               How unconsciously to themselves had their early teachings modified the influence upon Philip and Susannah of the Puritan rigors with which they were surrounded. They were not like those who had been driven by convictions, strong as life itself, to flee from what they felt to be soul-destroying doctrines and practices harmoniously ously abominable. Strong within Philip was the devotional element, and with few men were the restraints of religion more controling; yet for years it had been sighed over and prayed over, that he did not join him, self to God's elect. This had made him almost unknown in matters of Church and State, with powers to act in either, both shining and useful.
               In Susannah's nature bigotry was an impossible graft. In her new home gladly had she sought the altar of the living God. Nor could the closest scrutiny of those about her, accord to her life and conversation, aught but a near approach to the primitive standard, "walking circumspectly" and keeping herself "unspotted from the world." For her the Master's promise had been assured. "The poor, the suffering, ye shall have always with you." And abundantly had she "willed to do them good."
               The decision to which Philip and Susannah had come to in relation to their course in the witch troubles, was very wise. Philip's caution was most needful. It was no longer in strict confidence the afflicted children were seen and heard. Out of their crazed folly, half created by, but using at its will, all the weird superstitions and malice of the barbarous Tituba, and stimulated by an atmosphere of fanaticism, grew the phrenzied horrors to which we look back with so much wonder. Philip and Susannah had kept aloof as much as possible. They had never failed to express disapproval of all harsh measures, and their limited belief, as it seemed to the exacting and scrupulous of the extreme persecutors, the wretched victims they had relieved, soothed, comforted in every way they could. How often had Susannah's exquisite sensibility poured balm into wounds which could know no other earthly healing.
               The bloody terrible year '92 opened, but not to shed light on the still brooding darkness. The madness of the people raged on; the old, the crazed, the untoward, the wicked were not the only victims. Who, indeed, was safe?—the Church was inquisitorial; the State, it would seem, willing, yea, eager to obey her direst mandates. A solemn Council of the General Court was convened at Salem. Dark was the time, almost hopeless, when such dignity surrounded, such authority sustained, proceedings so frightful. Nineteen poor wretches had been executed. The sainted Martha Corey had met her fate, and her noble husband band won his martyr crown. Not long after this a fast was appointed in Salem by the Rev. Mr. Noyes—Susannah's own pastor; and New England's most distinguished clergy were to join in the solemnities. Cotton Mather was to preach the sermon; he was to be Susannah's guest. He arrived the night before. It was one of the sweetest of June mornings that with Philip and Susannah, followed by their large household retinue, he sought that "Tabernacle in the wilderness," whose early worshippers had so often listened to their heart's content and soul's profit to the wise Skelton, the tender, loving Higginson. After a sermon, that warned more of Satan's malice than it soothed by the promise of God's mercy, the benediction was spoken. Upon a bowed and awe-stricken congregation, the yellow light of high noon streamed in, as many of the worshippers silently moved out, leaving the chosen few who were to receive the Holy Sacrament. Cotton Mather had descended from the high pulpit, and stood by the communion-table; the ruling elders had seated themselves in the broad aisle, ready at the proper time to distribute the sacred elements. Then came that solemn stillness, the earthly type—if there be one—of that half hours' silence in the kingdom of God. The sublime prelude to the sublimest offering save one, in time or eternity. The angel-offering before the golden altar, the prevailing prayers of the saints of all ages. In this church on earth never before had this pause been broken, save by the trembling voice of God's minister.
               Now a sound and sight most unlooked for broke the calm. Mrs. English slowly rose, and passing down the broad aisle almost to the lowest bench, seated herself beside an aged and infirm woman—good-wife Cloyse. Bowed she was with years, but more at this time with a tortured heart. In her soul was that terrible conflict when God allows our profoundest human affections to be martyred or to reign in defiant antagonism to His service. Rebecca, her dear sister Rebecca, languished at that moment in a loathsome prison; and she fervently believed her to be as innocent, almost, as the saints in glory. Until this direful woe, together had they eaten that bread and drank that holy cup. Could she drink that cup now? could she eat that bread? could she thank God for His mercy? Was there any God? are there any saints? the Fiend whispered. And as she raised her head, and found herself left,—shunned, as it were, as an unclean thing by the congregation,—who, whether they knew it or not, had shrunk from kneeling or sitting near her. Who shall tell what, to her, was the sight of that stately form, that pitying face. The misery was almost drawn from her heart, the expression of hopeless wretchedness changed in her uplifted eyes, as Susannah came and seated herself beside her. Not a word was spoken, but the records of heaven alone can disclose what this blessed expression of human sympathy did, in its severest trial, for a suffering soul. The ministration and communion of the saints is not in the heavenly state alone, here below priceless, often, is its service. Susannah's sensitive spirit felt the wound she saw, and to her it was given to pour in the balm. Alas! in this wicked world how often is the holiest purpose "evil spoken of."
               The service proceeded; a frown, afterwards remembered, for a moment clouded the face of Cotton Mather. The surprised and questioning expression in the assembly soon passed away; and when the service was ended, Cotton Mather joined Philip in the porch, and Susannah parted with Sarah Cloyse with a few words of kindness, and a promise, which was very sweet to the worn woman, that she would see her the next day and do all that could be done to comfort her. Many were the comments on that day's service; and it was decided, as all such matters are, according to the temper or the mood of the judges; but as no one dared approach the Lady English in the matter, she, at least, heard nothing for some time of the conclusions darkly hinted at by some, mercilessly acted upon by others.
               The prisons continued full. The new governor, Sir William Phipps, had summoned a special court to be holden in the early autumn. Many, wearied by the unceasing terrors and miseries about them, and even trembling for themselves, hoped much from this. Susannah and Philip failed not of being of the number who were hopeful. Little dreamed they of what a few months would bring them. The summer wore along, the autumn had come. 'Twas one of those glorious October days when one remembers not August's wilt and heat, dreads not even in New England the coming "hard, chill bitterness of cold," but luxuriates in sunshine, air, color, all that Nature brings to every sense. It was on a day like this, not long after noon, that a trio well wonted and familiar there, sat in Cotton Mather's study. There was the Rev. Increase Mather, full of years, and crowned with honor; often in the lull of the earnest talk, he would look at his son with an expression of love and pride, but not unmingled with sadness. Saintly Mr. Moodey said little, but he drank in the words of both father and son, and doubtless, devoutly, in his humble heart, thanked God, that he vouchsafed to him such almost divine illumination. Cotton Mather, who dearly loved reverential listeners, was indulging himself in a sort of conversational "Magnalia." Many were the topics discussed; some thoroughly sifted, some only glanced at. The fearful work in Salem might have occupied more of their time; had either spoken of the fullness of his heart; but by a sort of shrinking, felt by all, little was said about it. Father and son were not, they never had been in anything like harmony of opinion about this matter. To tender Mr. Moodey weeping and fasting and praying, seemed the only weapons to be used, in what was to him a most bewildering conflict.
               In the midst of this godly and edifying conference, a most unexpected visitor was announced. "His worship, Mr. Justice Hathorne, from Salem, is below; and will be pleased to know if your Reverence can speak with him?" said a silver-haired serving man, presenting himself at the study door. The amazed party looked at each other. Cotton Mather rose, and hastily went to meet the stranger. Soon steps were heard on the stairs; and with his guest, he re-entered the study. John Hathorne solemnly greeted the aged President and Mr. Moodey. His composed and stately bearing was in most strange contrast to their surprised manner, and his own travel-stained garments. "A wise Providence has so ordered that we can give to each other counsel and aid in this matter," said Cotton Mather. "Will your Worship be seated? and be pleased to open your mind freely to us? May God send light and deliverance, for these are sorely vexed days." "My time is very short; my words must be few. Truly these are vexed days, the Lord is winnowing his people, in wrath scourging them, methinks," said Hathorne. "A warrant is now out in Salem; the Mistress Susannah English is charged as a 'most venomous witch.' I know,—you all know,—she is innocent." "This cannot be!" almost shrieked Cotton Mather. "This shall not be," said the President, in a calm, deep tone. A sort of moan came from Mr. Moodey, whose head had sunk on his breast. Susannah had soothed his wife's dying pillow. She had tenderly cared for his little ones, all sleeping now. The animus of the party was evidently all that the stern Justice needed, not only freely to open his mind and disclose his plan, but gladly to avail himself of their advice and aid. "I must examine her," he said; but he unbent himself to the horrified questioning expression which followed this announcement, to say: "A writ,—and am I not sworn? I shall remand her to the gaol in Boston; there let her remain until you can arrange that both Philip English and herself can repair to New Amsterdam, and tarry there until this tempest be overpast." This scheme met the approval of all. "Let it be called flight, banishment, or what it may; but in God's name, let it be done," said Mr. Moodey. Then was wrung from Cotton Mather that one solitary, relenting of conviction: "These things have gone too far," he said. Surely this expression may be urged in favor of his sincerity in generally advocating severe measures. He was, they were all, confronted with what they felt to be perfect innocence, foully assailed by accusation of the blackest guilt. They were not slow to act. As for Cotton Mather, who has suffered so much for the part he took in these strange proceedings, if his mind and judgment strayed so far from what we now consider a righteous decision, surely his heart was never degraded to malignity toward the victims. If we cannot forget his self-will, his pride of demoniac control, which with him was almost a real possession, may we not give his august memory the hope, that he was truly sorrowful for all the misery he honestly felt he could not prevent.
               All had prospered as he could desire, yet John Hathorne felt his work half done. From no one but himself should Philip English know what awaited him. It was not his wont to do anything in haste; this hurried visit to Boston had been undertaken that he might, when he broke the matter to Philip, be able to make it as endurable to him as possible—in sooth, as endurable to himself; for rarely had John Hathorne's inflexible spirit faltered before an act so fully sanctioned by his convictions of duty. After as little refreshment and rest as humanity claimed for himself and his worn steed, the lonely road to Salem saw the unattended Justice hastening home. Strange it might have been thought at any other time, but now every one was accustomed to things unlooked for, unheard of before. It was far into the night when his wearied horse brought him to the "Point of Rocks," which his grandfather, stern old Sir William, had bequeathed to him, and died before he knew how well his grandson would keep up his name and his honor. The moon shone brightly over Philip English's home. Its seven gables stood out in distinct, sharp outline; never before had such feelings risen in John Hathorne's heart as he gazed upon it, though for nearly twenty years it had been one of the most familiar objects of his home landscape. "God help us all and me for to-morrow's work!" he almost groaned, as he laid his tired head on his pillow, and thought what "to-morrow" must bring to him. The morning came; the worship of his household was over; he sallied forth; there was no time to be lost. He entered the English gateway. Susannah was just passing out on some accustomed errand. Long after, with an intuitive comprehension of the whole matter, she recalled and rightly interpreted his more than usually cheerful morning greeting. Partly the effort to conceal what he feared might be read in his face, but chiefly at the relief in knowing that he should. find Philip alone, that Susannah would not be there. "Is the worthy master within," he asked, almost gayly. "I will conduct you to him," Susannah said, with a grace peculiarly her own. "With your leave, I will seek him; Mrs. English need not delay herself;" and with a low bow, he rather hastily passed into the porch, and Susannah went her way.
               John Hathorne entered the dwelling. A sight not unfamiliar, and never before painful to him, greeted his eyes. Looking out upon the sloping lawn, whose borders were washed by the rarely ruffled waters of the quiet cove, in a spacious hall, sat Philip English. He rose to greet his always welcomed neighbor and friend. "All goes well with you, Mr. Justice, this bright morning, I trust. Sit here," he said, rising; "the warm sunshine makes the wind none too cool to my thinking." John Hathorne paused, but only for a moment. "Philip English, listen to what you must hear. I would that God had spared us both, but His will be done! A writ is out,—to-morrow Mrs. English must be examined before me, accused as a witch. I believe her innocent." A voice that seemed to come from afar, responded, "Believe her innocent!" What meant this tone? John Hathorne looked, was he mocked and taunted? There was no misinterpreting, no misunderstanding—the agony which had almost paralyzed the stalwart man before him, and bewildered to senseless incoherency, the strong mind of Philip English. We are made of dust. Such a crisis is always short. Philip came back to himself, but it seemed to him another self. As two true men always can, in all that God sends of woe or sorrow to his creatures, aid and relieve each other, so it was now. Philip listened to the plan made for him. He did not attempt to criticise, nor did he even try to express any thankfulness; but as John Hathorne went out to his daily routine, he took with him the consciousness that the gratitude known only to a heart whose hope is ready to perish, was his, and his for ever. Happily for Philip he must act. First of all he must tell Susannah. His household must be arranged for their departure. Mary, Richard Hollingsworth, must know, and all so soon. There was mercy to him in this rush and crush of events. Philip was fast regaining his power, his energy, coming back to his old self. He had scarcely heard the sweet music of Mary's harpsichord, but the rustle of Susannah's silken dress, her step, her dear voice, made him tremble when she came in and found him just as she had left him more than two hours before, seated in that ample, cheerful hall.
               "Still here," she said. "This is not as we planned, Philip. The worshipful Judge and yourself have been taking great ease this bonny morning." Philip felt he had never been tried before. He drew near to her. He put his arms about her—his voice was low, unbroken: "Susannah, you are accused as a witch!" For a moment her slight form swayed, bent with a sort of spasm. Then she cried out as that voice was never heard before: "Who have I ever injured? Who has accused me?" She stood erect, and lifting her eyes to heaven, cried, "Tell me not who has accused me. I will not tempt my weak heart. God's will be done!" Then burst the terrible storm long pent up within him. "I will bury them deep in hell before God sends me death!" cried Philip. "Wilt thou lay on me now a woe I cannot bear, Philip? Promise me. Swear to me! I ask you for the love of my whole heart, the love of my whole life, that you will not plot or seek revenge." Never before had his soul wrestled so with the powers of darkness. "Art thou a mortal woman, or an angel, Susannah?" he said. The tone told Susannah she had triumphed. And sobbing like a broken-hearted child, she laid her head on his panting breast.
               So fell this heavy woe on the home of the "Seven Gables," so far John Hathorne's work was done. Well, too, had his allies done their part. He had not left Cotton Mather's house, before their promises to him, their determination to aid Susannah, began to be carried out. "I will seek Sir William Phipps, and with his help, make this thing possible, and as easy as it may be," said Increase Mather. He turned to Mr. Moodey; "It may be, Brother Moodey, that you can best arrange a comfortable apartment in the gaol for the Mistress English." He seemed to hesitate, struck, as it were, by the strangeness of his own request. "The Mistress English in a gaol!" "Son Cotton, you will not fail to be with our sister. Godly counsel her soul will need, for it must be sore vexed." Increase Mather sought the governor that very night. His personal relations with him made an interview easy at any time. There he sat with his "haughty dame," as she has so often been called, at his side. The venerable President laid the matter at once before him. And they were earnestly discussing it, when Lady Phipps suddenly turned, and said: "Mrs. English!—dwelling in Salem! And was she once Susannah Hollingsworth? William!" she cried; "this is my dear 'Matin Hill' Susannah! Have we not pulled cowslips and daisies together? Was she not always as good as she was beautiful? Accused as a witch! To what terrible place have we come? Let us go back to England. Let us take Susannah with us. Where is Philip?" This was all in one breath, but Dr. Mather knew his point was gained. Sir William would do readily all the kind, wise old man asked. Could anything be impossible to such a combination of Church and State in those days. It could hardly be in any. Lady Phipps' fears were assuaged; but still she would fain have gone to Susannah, or that Susannah should have come to her. "This must not be now," said Dr. Mather; "had better not be for her sake," with courtier-like tact, and with his usual sagacity, he added. Thus the power of Sir William, the wisdom of Increase Mather, the gratitude of Mr. Moodey, the devotion of John Hathorne moved harmoniously to make for Philip and Susannah a deliverance, as merciful as their misery might have been hopeless.
               The horrid preliminaries in Salem were over, the days in Boston were passed, and Philip and Susannah are on their way to New Amsterdam. This flight! this pilgrimage! this journey! what was it then? With all Philip's money and care could do, that which the modern facilities of travel has made like a butterfly's afternoon-digester, a blue-bird's "constitutional," was then only unlike a search for the Nile's sources, or the northwest passage to India, because the one was thought possible, and the others supposed not to be. At last it was accomplished! Our fugitives found favor with the worthy burghers and their honest fraus. In their midst Philip comfortably settled himself for the winter. Susannah's sunny temperament, outgoing goodness, long established Lady Bountiful habits, found scope and objects, and could not fail anywhere to make about her an atmosphere of good will. All that they heard from Salem was calculated to reassure their minds.
               Richard Hollingsworth seemed to brighten—grow young again, as old age will, when unexpectedly pushed to duties which have naturally passed out of its sphere. It is only a sort of meteoric brightness, which, perhaps haps, tells of the decay of real power,—or, may it not be, a glimpse of that "making of all things new," when Time shall no more waste human strength? Their dear Mary was all she should be under such trying circumstances. "Truly God hath remembered mercy," was often in Susannah's heart. The winter wore on, they were advised by their faithful friends, that when the spring should make the passage endurable, they might think of turning their steps homeward. The cloud that had so wrapped them in its gloomy shadow was passing rapidly away, the moral atmosphere was growing clearer, "God was stilling the madness of the people."
               Early in February a letter came from Salem—it was the second they had had. Both had seemed to them a special gift of Providence. One human instrumentality to bring about such results, undoubtedly had been Philip's well-filled purse. There was love, cheer, comfort, in this last missive. Mary had written part, Richard Hollingsworth had added a few paragraphs, in the stately and somewhat involved style of his day. His most important item was: "That corn was very scarce," and that the "poor people were terribly pinched." "That good man Gookin and his old wife had nearly starved." "The poor old souls," said Susannah, "it does seem to me Mary or father might have known they were so lacking, before they came to real hunger." Philip pondered long and deeply. "Susannah," he said, so suddenly and so earnestly, that she dropped her needle-work, and replied with such a startled, expectant look, that he involuntarily voluntarily changed his tone to reassure her. "What think you of this? I have it in my mind to buy supplies of corn; the cribs are full to overflowing all around us. Let us send it to our suffering town's-folk!" "You have it in your heart, my own dear Philip!" she replied, with glistening eyes; "let it be done as soon as it can be." Thrice blessed, good for evil! Coals of fire, heaped not on human heads alone, but kindling in grateful hearts, flames that send to heaven most precious incense.
               I know not how it was brought about, but the corn came to Salem. The people flocked to the wharf, the laden craft was soon unburdened. Philip had directed under whose authority, and in what way it should be dispensed. Timely, most needful, was the gift; his name and that of Susannah rang through the streets of the quiet town. "The people ate, and were more than satisfied."
               The days of "sojourning in a strange land" were over, and our exiles found themselves once more in their dear New England.
               June had come again, when in Boston, Mary and Richard Hollingsworth joined them. Mr. Moodey had wept at the sight of them; Cotton Mather had prayed from the bottom of his heart over them; and they were at last, with thoughts and feelings that could not be uttered, fairly on the old familiar road, and every moment was bringing them nearer to their own dear home. The hill, that still catches the sun's last beams on the old Boston road, had just been climbed, and they were rapidly descending scending its side (far steeper then than now). Susannah was eagerly looking from the carriage-window. "There are great crowds coming towards us, it seems to me, Philip. What does it mean?" She turned deadly pale. Philip looked out, but could give no explanation.
               The people drew near in throngs; they seized the horses, and almost tore the clumsy gearing from their smoking sides. Those who were not lucky enough to lay their hands on the shafts, would fain push the heavy mud-laden wheels. I cannot tell what words from Susannah called forth shouts from many, and sturdy Preserve Parkins, the blacksmith, cried out, "Bread put into starving men's mouths, makes their arms strong, most worthy Mistress English!" The Queen of Sheba never heard a more heart-felt salutation. "God bless and keep your dear worships!" was the hearty response to an expression of mingled recognition and benediction on Susannah's lovely face.
               So they were brought by stalwart arms, and loving, grateful hearts, to the house of the "Seven Gables." The throng swelled as it moved along. It seemed as if the whole towns-people stood before them, when beneath their ample porch they turned to part with their rejoicing friends. There was a hush. John Hathorne's stately form stepped from among the crowd—he approached Philip and Susannah, holding in his hand a silver goblet. "I need not tell you, Philip and Susannah English, that your neighbors, that every inhabitant of this town, gives you hearty welcome home! There are those who have asked,—all before you will ask you now, methinks, that you pledge in this, up with them: 'Prosperity to our town, with your blessing and forgiveness.'" He raised the cup, and gave it to Philip.
               "Bring a butt of my Michaelmas malt! a pipe of canary!" shouted Philip. Marvelously soon was he obeyed, and by a sort of magic, cups and cans supplied the means of response to his pledge. Right royally was it given, and royally felt, too. "My friends, let Peace and Love be between us!" He lifted the cup to Susannah's lips—she bowed her beautiful head, kissed its sparkling brim, and murmured, "Let us give thanks unto the Lord." That murmur reached every ear and touched every heart. Then were the cups drained. There was a little stir in the crowd, and some one lifted old Sarah Cloyse—her staff had failed her, or had been pushed in the crowd from her weak and withered hands. She resisted not, and perhaps no one, but herself, knew that it was on her knees she would fain have received the precious blessing. The crowd dispersed, and peace rested once more under that "seven-gabled" roof.
               The silver cup was in Philip's hand when he turned, and said solemnly to his assembled household: "This cup shall be ever with me, it shall stand beside my 'Raeburn Beaker,' and they shall both lie with me in my grave."
               
               Here the old manuscript breaks off. I have filled many gaps in it, that I might make it readable. I have done the very best I could. Remember, I have had no Dr. Bentley to answer questions—no Salem Athenæum to refer to. Dr. Bentley's short and unsatisfactory record of Philip and Susannah English in the "Massachusetts Historical Collections," I have read. But unless he enlarged very much in talking on the subject, my worthy Uncle Edmund, took great liberties with his narration. Perhaps the venerable and learned antiquarian would have forgiven him, for he was the perfection of good temper, and dearly loved a good story.
               One other thing I am going to tell you, though it is like the parting cadence of an old nursery rhyme. Blythsome Mary English, married John Hathorne's son. And if a bit of bright sunshine flitted from the "Seven Gables" to the rather sombre "Point of Rocks," I am not quite sure, that it was not, after a long, long time, fully paid back. Certainly, the most glorious light that ever gleamed on that notable mansion, might be traced not very indirectly to this event.
