               CHAPTER I.
               THE BROTHERS.
               IN a by-lane, about half a mile from the pleasant country town of Tattleton Regis, stood, at the period when this story commences, two small cottages, one of which was occupied by two brothers named Morton. Both were sufferers from severe, and apparently hopeless physical infirmity; but in all other respects they were so totally dissimilar that they demand a separate description.
               John, the elder, was about three or four and twenty. In height, strength, and build, I would call him a handsome Hercules, if the idea of the heathen demi-god were not so universally blended with the ugly cumbersome, brutish form under which he is commonly represented. John Morton's robust, muscular limbs, broad shoulders, deep chest, and erect carriage, might have furnished the painter or sculptor with an infinitely finer model, for they manifested grace and activity as well as mere inert strength. His features, in unusual accordance with the symmetry of his form, were cast in a mould of strictly manly beauty, set off by a redundance of "Hyacinthine" locks of a dark chestnut brown, and a thick, curly beard of a somewhat lighter shade, which had never felt the razor. His eyes alone, though perfect in form and color, were defective in expression and vivacity, for they were sightless. His dress was a plain suit of fustian, such as might be worn by a respectable mechanic; and his linen, though scrupulously clean, was coarse in texture.
               His brother William, his junior by one year, had been a cripple from his earliest infancy. In consequence of some injury to the spine, his legs were powerless. The rest of his body was well developed, and many persons would have pronounced his face handsomer than his brother's, so keen an intelligence flashed from the piercing black eyes, and irradiated the pale, sharply cut features. His hair was black and straight, but arranged with the utmost care. His chin and upper lip were closely shaven, and only a small pair of neatly trimmed whiskers adorned his cheeks. His dress was of black broad-cloth; but the coat hung on a peg behind him, and its place was supplied by a comfortable dressing-gown, which, falling open at the throat, displayed linen of the finest quality.
               The occupations of the two were as different as their dress and appearance.
               The elder, guided by a delicate and highly developed sense of touch, and aided by an occasional hint from his brother, was occupied in repairing a Bath-chair of the homeliest description. The younger was seated in a well-stuffed, comfortable, though old-fashioned easy-chair, before a table covered with books and papers, with which he was busily engaged.
               The room was large and low, taking up the whole of the ground-floor of the cottage, and had consequently to serve for every purpose, from entrance hall, kitchen and work-shop, to dining-room and study. A staircase at one end led to two sleeping-rooms. The first, which served as a passage to the second, was without a fire-place, uncarpeted, and almost unfurnished, for it contained little besides a truckle-bed, a chest, and a washing stand, formed by means of a shelf fixed in a corner. The inner apartment was supplied with every comfort. The walls were papered, the floor was carpeted, the warm bed as well as the window was curtained, and a fire blazed in the grate.
               It is scarcely necessary to specify to which of the brothers the respective chambers belonged.
               "Do you think you will get that confounded thing done to-night?" asked the younger, suddenly breaking a silence that had lasted for nearly an hour.
               "I will finish it, replied the other; "but don't sit up on that account, Will. Go to bed if you are tired."
               
               "Of course I am tired," said William, in a tone of ill-suppressed irritability; "it can't be expected that I am anything but completely worn out by the labor I have to get through every day. Chained to the office desk from ten till five, and then four or five hours of hard study in the evening—it's enough to weary one."
               John sighed, but made no answer. It is possible, however, that the thought may have crossed his mind, that to work at basket-making from five in the morning till ten or eleven at night, interrupted only by the more active labor of propelling the chaise, which he was now repairing, to and from the attorney's office at which his brother was employed, and all in the "total eclipse" of complete blindness, was labor quite as severe and wearisome as that of which William complained so bitterly.
               "Why don't you go to bed, Will?" demanded John once more, after another interval of silence, during which his quick ears had caught many an impatient grunt, and testy re-arrangement of the chair cushions. "I shan't be above an hour, I dare say, and I'll not make any noise to disturb you when I go up stairs."
               "You always do make a noise, however," replied William, with a sneer, "but I suppose you can't help it. So I shall not go to bed with the certainty of being roused out of my first sleep. Besides, Laporte comes to-morrow, and I have that French lesson to study for him."
               "Do it aloud then, will you?" said the blind man, "it will give me something to think of, and help to pass the time away."
               "Yes; and help to lengthen it out too," responded the other ungraciously; "how will your work get on while you are hammering over a French verb, and trying to keep pace with me?"
               The elder brother replied as before, with a sigh, and continued his work in silence.
               Before many minutes had elapsed, however, William was obliged to appeal to him for the assistance which the good-natured fellow had in fact proffered, under the pretence of seeking only a distraction for himself in his weary imprisonment from all pleasurable or intellectual objects. But even in this, William would not own to any superiority in his brother.
               "How does Laporte pronounce this sentence?" he began. "You, having nothing to harass or occupy your thoughts, can retain these trivial matters, which escape from my mind amid the many weighty topics which I have to entertain."
               Disregarding, or perhaps not perceiving, the contemptuous manner in which his brother referred to himself, John's face brightened at the prospect of serving him.
               The last lesson, like all that had preceded it, had been heedfully listened to by the blind man, and carefully committed to memory. An ear, trained to catch not only the faintest sounds, but the slightest variations of tone and accent, aided by sympathetic and highly flexible vocal organs, enabled him to seize and repeat all the niceties of the foreign pronunciation; and William knowing this from experience, referred to him with as much security as he would have felt in consulting Monsieur Laporte himself.
               It had been the same with Latin, with arithmetic, with mathematics, with every study to which the ambitious and aspiring younger brother had devoted himself from the age of twelve, when the two orphan lads, leaving the school where they had been brought up, were thrown upon the world, dependent solely on the elder's skill in basket-making for their daily bread. And by this means, all unconsciously to himself, as he lacked that familiar intercourse with other minds, which alone can furnish a standard by which to estimate our own attainments, John had laid the foundation of excellent education. Had he entertained a less humble opinion of himself, he might, indeed, have contrasted his own progress with his brother's, and discovered that, notwithstanding the disadvantage under which he labored, from being deprived of the assistance of his eyes, he learned, weighed, and digested the subjects of their various studies in a manner that enabled him almost to become that brother's preceptor. So profound, however, was his respect for William's abilities, that he never dreamt of placing himself in comparison with him; while William's self-love, and overweening vanity and conceit, prevented him from imagining for a moment that "poor John" could ever be his rival in an thing, excepting mere brute strength. So he used his patient and good-tempered brother as a drudge to help him on with his studies, just as he used him to supply his own want of locomotive power, without suspecting that John's quick intellect extracted more mental nutriment than his own from the exercise in the one case, just as his limbs became strengthened and developed in the other.
               But the really strong are seldom self-conscious; and John, never finding that his sinews were over-tasked by any demand that was made upon them, supposed that he was only as strong as other men; while his powerful mind, taking in information of every kind without an effort, was perfectly submissive to the oft-repeated sarcastic remark of his brother, that being blind, of course he could know nothing.
               On this point the brothers held but one opinion, that John, the humble, was foredoomed to ignorance and submission; while William, the arrogant, was designed by nature to attain the highest summit of intellectual greatness and worldly ambition.
               Yet it was hardly by choice that William had entered the profession of the law. In the first instance, his good hand-writing, and the natural commiseration of a generous heart for two youths, both so sadly afflicted, and both so industriously earning their living and educating themselves under circumstances of such immense difficulty, induced Mr. Lonsdale, a lawyer in large practice, to give William employment as a copying clerk. After awhile, by incessant labor, and the strictest economy, (exercised, it must be owned, chiefly at poor John's expense) sufficient money was accumulated to pay for William's regular indentures. Mr. Lonsdale received him as an articled clerk, but generously declined to receive more than half the usual premium.
               From that time, though they continued to live in the old cottage, William provided himself with every comfort, and even luxury. As for John, "he was used" to hardships, and therefore the hard bed with its scanty covering, the breakfast and supper of oatmeal porridge, the suit of fustian, and the coarse and mended linen, were quite suited to his station; besides he was only a basket-maker, and even if he had his sight, would be nothing better than a low handicraftsman. Whereas, William was a being of a superior mould, with refined tastes, and delicate feelings, which required comforts that would be thrown away upon rough John. He was, moreover, by nature and profession, a gentleman; and he had already made a great sacrifice of his own taste and respectability in dwelling in such a lowly hut to please his boorish brother; which, however, he was obliged to do as long as he was, in a great measure, dependent on that brother's labor for the supply of his personal comforts. Such, when reduced to the naked fact, was the substance of William's reasonings, wound up by a determination to free himself altogether from the low connection of the plebeian John, as soon as his own income was sufficiently large and certain to enable him to keep a servant, and live in a style befitting the station to which he aspired.
               Many a fretful sigh did William heave, as he calculated that three or four years must elapse before it would be possible to put this darling plan into execution; for he was far too cautious and astute to risk its success by the slightest precipitation.
               Yet, at the very moment when it was entirely absent from his thoughts, and his whole attention was absorbed in the constructions of the French language, events were occurring within a few hundred yards of the cottage which were to bring its accomplishment immediately within his grasp.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               AN ACCIDENT.
               JOHN MORTON'S sense of hearing was remarkably acute.
               "Hark!" he exclaimed, laying down his tools, and starting up, "there are two horses running away with a carriage!"
               "Well, and if there are, what then?" said William, coolly.
               "It's coming down the hill!" cried John, in wild excitement; "we may be in time! Jump on my back, Will, and we will go out and stop them!"
               "Do you take me for an ass?" was the other's sneering reply.
               "But somebody may be killed!" said John, in a tone of passionate entreaty.
               "Two fools would no doubt be killed, if I were as great a simpleton as yourself."
               John groaned, and opened the cottage door to listen to the fearful sound of the horses' hoofs madly striking on the frosty ground, and the clattering wheels which seemed rather to leap than to roll behind them, as they tore at a frightful pace down a steep hill, that terminated near the point where the lane in which their cottage was situated joined the main road.
               "Pray shut that door!" cried William, peevishly, as he wrapped his warm gown closer round him. "What earthly good can you do to those people by chilling me to the bones? Besides, I don't think there are any people there; it's most likely only an empty wagon."
               "No," said John, sadly, "a wagon has a very different sound. This is a carriage with springs. And there are people in it, for I heard a man's voice call for help, and a woman screamed faintly. God help them!"
               He returned to his bench, and sat down with his elbows on his knees, and his head resting on his hands.
               "How extremely selfish you are, John!" said William, reproachfully. "I regret to say it, but you are selfish. You know that I cannot go to the office to-morrow, unless that chair is mended, and yet you neglect it for the sake of indulging your own foolish fancies."
               John never resented his brother's unkind speeches. He often felt them keenly; but as be invariably set them down to the constitutional irritability naturally resulting from his affliction, he took care that William should not see that he was even grieved. So he went on with his work, but it was with the greatest difficulty that he compelled even a moderate show of attention to the French lesson.
               In about half an hour, hasty steps were heard without, followed by an imperative knocking at the door.
               "Does Mr. William Morton live here?" cried a voice which both immediately recognized as that of Mr. Lonsdale's man-servant.
               "Open the door, John, and see what's amiss," said William, in a tone of great annoyance; adding in an undertone, "who'd have thought of that fool finding me out here?"
               "Mr. Lonsdale has met with a dreadful accident," said the agitated and panting domestic. "He has been thrown out of his carriage, and the doctor says he can't live the night out, and he wants you to make his will. And you have not a moment to lose."
               John quietly took his brother's coat from the hook where it hung, and helped him to exchange his dressing-gown for it.
               "How can I go?" said William, "my chair is broken, and is not repaired yet."
               "I must carry you," replied John, quietly; "there'll be nobody about now, and the case is too urgent for you to stand upon ceremony. Was that Mr. Lonsdale's carriage, then, that passed along this road half an hour since?"
               "Yes it was, replied the man. "He was driving himself in the pheeaton. He'd been to the station to fetch a lady, and she was in the carriage along with him; and it seems the horses took fright on top of Stoke Hill, and run away, and dashed the pheeaton against the turnpike, and broke it to bits, and the lady was killed dead on the spot, and poor master he's so badly injured inwardly that he can't live the night through. So make haste, Mr. Morton, for he's in that dreadful suffering that he may lose his senses any minute."
               "Are you ready, Will?" said John, in a low tone.
               "Yes, yes," replied his brother, impatiently; and then, blushing deeply, he added to his servant, "You see, Adams, I am so completely lame, that as my chair is broken, my brother must carry me. It would take me an hour to get there on my crutches."
               "O, la! Mr. Morton, I've often seen you when you were lads, running about like one boy—you a-top of John's back. People used often to say what a good-natured chap he was."
               While this passed, John had quietly stooped before his brother's chair. William's arms were strong, and clasping them round John's neck, he easily drew himself up.
               "Now come along," said John, "you'll have to run, Adams."
               The blind man locked the cottage door, and set off at a rapid pace towards the town.
               As the last gleam of the fire-light illuminated William's countenance, Adams actually started back in terror; the handsome, pale features were distorted by such an expression of savage malignity. The impression remained on his mind until they reached Mr. Lonsdale's house; and then the first glimpse of light showed him William's face, smooth and calm as ever, and the evil fancy was obliterated.
               The young clerk remained for nearly an hour alone with Mr. Lonsdale in his bedroom. Then the surgeon and others were admitted, while William, undisturbed by the groans of the dying man, or the bustle and agitation of his attendants, wrote away at a side-table.
               Then the room was cleared again, while he read the will to his master. Again they were recalled; the will was signed and duly witnessed, and with that last effort the strength which had hitherto sustained the lawyer appeared to desert him.
               "You will go at once?" he gasped out, clutching William's hand, when the abatement of a violent paroxysm of pain left him capable of speaking; "You'll remember the place? Near the white gate, on the left-hand side, half-way down the hill?"
               "Do not distress yourself, my dear sir," replied William, "I will forget nothing, and I will go immediately."
               Nevertheless he lingered. Spasm after spasm convulsed the once vigorous frame of the lawyer, and only once did a gleam of consciousness revisit him.
               "You will take care of her, William? You will be kind to her?" he said, fixing his eyes on the young man's face.
               "Rely on me, Mr. Lonsdale," was the reply.
               It was hardly spoken, when a placid smile overspread the features of the dying man, and he sank back, a corpse.
               Notwithstanding his promise to his master to execute his last injunction without delay, William Morton remained in the house until the official seal had been placed upon every receptacle that might be supposed to contain either private documents or articles of value. The luggage belonging to the unfortunate lady who had been killed, was secured with especial care, and the keys delivered into his possession. He incidentally accounted for his authoritative proceedings by saying that the lady was the widow of Mr. Lonsdale's brother, and that he, William Morton, was appointed, under the lawyer's will, sole executor and trustee to his estate, and guardian to his niece.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               A MIDNIGHT TRAMP.
               PROBABLY the unexpected promotion to a post of great trust, and the sudden accession of property, might have raised William Morton's self-conceit to an exorbitant pitch; but certain it is that he would have remained at his late employer's abode, had it not been for the mission before mentioned. After having dismissed everybody from the room, and all he could from the house, he mounted John's strong back, preparatory to his return to the cottage, which he had already ceased to regard as his home. His face was livid under the influence of the malignant feelings that possessed him; and he felt sick with loathing at the undignified position he was compelled to assume.
               "Poor Will!" said John, as they proceeded down the deserted street, "you are quite knocked up with fatigue and grief. I can feel it by the heavy way that you sit."
               "I wish you would not talk," growled William, "you disturb my ideas, besides attracting attention. And pray, tread with less noise, unless you want all the fools' heads in the town to be poked out of windows, gaping at me. Remember that if you have no delicacy of feeling, I have."
               With his customary patient sigh, John plodded on, and did not utter another word till they reached home.
               "Get the lantern ready," said William, stirring the fire close to which his easy chair was placed, and warming his hands at the comfortable blaze; "and when that is done, call up Mrs. Palmer. Tell her I have something of importance to communicate to her. No, you will only make a blunder of the message. Say that, she must get up immediately and come in to speak to me."
               John quietly executed his brother's orders, and in a short time Mrs. Palmer made her appearance, in a state of supreme amazement at being summoned from her bed at that hour of the night. She was an old woman who lived alone in the cottage adjoining that which was occupied by the two brothers; and her chief means of subsistence, besides knitting stockings and other articles, was derived from the performance of those household duties which John was incapable of executing.
               "Mrs. Palmer," said William, as she entered, "I have to go out again on business of importance, and I wish you to prepare some supper for me. What is there in the house?"
               "There's no cold meat," she replied, rather sulkily, "but there's bread and cheese, and butter and oatmeal."
               "Is there no meat? I thought I saw you bring some in."
               "There's a piece of neck of mutton that I'm going to roast for your dinners to-morrow."
               "That will do very well. Cut a couple of chops off that, and have everything ready to broil them as soon as I return. I may be gone half an hour or more."
               "Dear heart alive!" exclaimed the old dame, "who'd ever think of cooking chops at this time of night! you must be going clean out of your senses!"
               "No, I am not," replied William, with the nearest approach to a laugh that he was ever known to indulge in. "I've had some money left me, old lady; so I can afford to indulge in a hot supper, and to pay you well for your trouble too."
               "Well—I'll do what you want then," said Mrs. Palmer, half-pacified; "and what's John to have? Shall I do some chops for him too?"
               "I thought you said there was plenty of bread and cheese," returned the affectionate brother; "I must not be too extravagant just at first, Goody, for I cannot get hold of my money for a few weeks perhaps. Keep awake, for I may have something else for you to do, that you will be well paid for. Now, John, I'm ready."
               "Which way do you want to go?" asked John, when they had, crossed the portal.
               "Up the hill; and you had better take your dog with you."
               "He is loose," said John, "I let him out before we went to Mr. Lonsdale's. Here! Lion! Lion!"
               But though he called and whistled, no Lion responded with his usual greeting.
               "Curse the brute!" cried William, angrily, "always in the way when he is not wanted, and never to be found when he might be of use. He's gone poaching, I've no doubt; and I shall have to pay for his depredations."
               "You enjoy the hares that he brings in, nevertheless," replied John, over whose open brow a cloud of displeasure passed at this unprovoked attack upon his canine friend, "and you have not yet had to pay anything for them."
               "I am very much annoyed at his being out of the way now, however. He might have saved me considerable trouble; and it's no pleasant thing to be exposed to this bleak night wind, I assure you. You don't feel it, because you can keep yourself warm with exercise, but I am quite benumbed with the cold. Get on as quickly as possible, and let us have it over."
               John toiled steadily up the steep ascent of the hill, down which Mr. Lonsdale's carriage had dashed only a few hours before. He had no reason to complain of the cold, had it been in his nature to complain of anything, for the perspiration ran down his ruddy face, with the exertions he made to relieve his beloved brother from his painful position.
               
               "Hark!" he exclaimed, stopping suddenly. "I hear Lion's voice. He is not far off; I heard him whine. Lion! where are you? Lion!"
               A louder whine led him to the side of the road where, by the light of the lantern which John carried suspended from his waist, William saw the dog busily engaged about a large bundle that lay in the dry ditch by the wayside. On a nearer approach he found that the outer envelope of this bundle was a thick fur railway rug, which Lion was carefully dragging out of the ditch.
               "This is better than I expected," observed William. A little farther, John. Now stoop, and take the bundle from the dog. Be careful, for I believe there is a child in it. Open the wrapper, and let me see. Yes, there is a child. Is she alive?"
               "Yes," replied John, "she is warm, and breathing. How can we take her home? If you will hold her, I can carry you both."
               "No, I can't do that," said William. "I will return home first, and you must fetch the child afterwards. Tell the dog to remain with her, and you'll easily find her."
               John replaced the warm cover round the little sleeper, and giving Lion orders to mount guard over her, he hastened back to the cottage. While William ate his savory supper, his brother, now chilled all down his spine by the absence of the warm burthen he had heated himself in carrying, made his way as fast as he could, to the spot where his faithful dog kept guard over the sleeping child.
               As soon as his master's well-known step was heard, Lion uttered a short, joyful bark, which attracted him to the spot. John carefully raised the poor little girl in his arms, and guided by the instinct of the dog, who warned him of any approaching danger, he made his way rapidly back to the cottage.
               Mrs. Palmer took the child from him, and held her for William's inspection, where the light fell full upon her face. She was a pretty little creature, about three years old, and had probably cried herself to sleep, after her poor mother, in the extremity of her terror, had thrown her, wrapped in the thick rug, from the carriage, for her eye lids were swollen, and her cheeks were stained with tears.
               "Take her to your own house, Mrs. Palmer," said William, after this scrutiny; "put her to bed, and take every care of her. You may rely on being well paid for your trouble. Stay—here is something to begin with."
               He put five shillings into her hand, and the old woman, well-pleased, bade the brothers good-night, and bore away the unconscious child to her own cottage.
               "Whose child is that, Will?" asked John, as he sat contentedly down to his humble supper of bread and cheese.
               "A child that fell out of Mr. Lonsdale's carriage when the horses ran away, and whom I shall have to send to her friends as soon as I can find them."
               
               "She is not Mr. Lonsdale's niece, then?" observed the elder brother.
               "What could put such an idea into your stupid head? Miss Lonsdale is quite a young woman. Pray don't go and publish your wonderful discoveries, or you will involve me in endless troubles."
               "I don't know exactly why I thought she was Mr. Lonsdale's niece," said John. "I suppose it was because it seemed most likely that she would be with Mrs. Lonsdale, and not a strange child,"
               "You seem even more than usually disposed to talk nonsense to-night," said the other, with increased irascibility; "and there you sit, enjoying yourself, when you must know that I am wearied to death, and ought to be in bed. And there's that beast of a dog too! Why do you bring him in, when you know how I dislike it? It must be done on purpose to annoy me."
               "No, indeed, Will, it wasn't," said John, earnestly; "but I thought, as he has done such good service to-night, that he might share my supper."
               "You are, without any exception, the most selfish, and inconsiderate person I ever met with," grumbled William, as his brother, leaving his frugal meal almost untasted, prepared to carry him up stairs. "You think a great deal more of that brute than you do of me; and I shall be heartily rejoiced when circumstances enable me to dispense with assistance so grudgingly rendered. I trust that time is not very far distant; and then I shall not be neglected for a dog, as I am now; and left stuck fast like a log in my chair, because I am a poor helpless cripple, until you can find leisure to help me to my bed, after the fatigue I have gone through, and the cold to which I have been exposed."
               No one could have blamed John if he had set his ungrateful brother down on the stairs, and left him there till he apologized for his ill-temper. But it was not in John's nature to do anything of the sort. He regarded his brother's physical infirmity as an excuse for any amount of irritability of temper; and even if William struck him, which he sometimes did, his large compassionate heart, and patient soul made allowance for the outrage, and he attributed it mentally to "poor Will's" suffering some pain, which he forebore to complain of, or else to his feeling, more acutely than usual, the state of utter helplessness to which his lameness reduced him.
               On this particular night, however, the expressions that William had used, and his eager anticipations of soon being able to employ other aid than his brother's, gave John grounds for serious reflection.
               As soon as William was comfortably ensconced in his warm, soft couch, John returned to the lower room, and sat for some time in deep and sorrowful thought, mechanically feeding Lion, but not eating a morsel himself.
               His reflections were interrupted by a loud knocking with a stick on the floor above. It was William's signal that he required him, and he hastened to answer it.
               "What are you doing down there?" demanded the younger brother in a querulous tone. "I suppose you were going to sleep over the fire."
               "No, I was not asleep, Will; and I think the fire is gone out," replied John, in his usual gentle voice.
               "What a time you take over your supper then. Do remember that I must go into the town early in the morning, and the noise you will make in mending that confounded old chair will keep me awake all the rest of the night. You might have nearly finished it by this time."
               "I will do it at once," said John, in a low, sad tone; "try to sleep, Will. I will make as little noise as can."
               So earnestly did he endeavor—this utterly unselfish man—to avoid disturbing his poor suffering brother, that his labor was necessarily prolonged, and when he had completed it, the twittering of the birds outside the cottage warned him that day was breaking.
               At that late hour it would have been of little use to go to bed, so he lay down on the floor with a great-coat over him, and Lion's flank for a pillow, and snatched a short repose before Mrs. Palmer knocked at the door and commenced the operations of lighting the fire, and preparing breakfast.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               MRS. PALMER SPEAKS HER MIND.
               "WELL, that do go beautiful now," said the old woman, as she pushed the wheel-chair outside the door; "'and however you could do it without being able to see, passes my understanding altogether. And I don't believe as you've been to bed all night. You don't look as if you had, anyway."
               "It was daybreak before I had finished," replied John, "for the little birds were twittering, so it was not worth while to go to bed."
               "And what did you eat for your supper?" demanded Mrs. Palmer, examining the supper tray; "this cheese is just as it was, and there's none of the beer gone out of the jug, as I can see."
               "I did not want any supper, Goody, or I should have eaten it," said John, almost as apologetically as though he had committed an error.
               "William ought to be ashamed of himself, that he ought!" exclaimed the old woman, indignantly, "and you may tell him I said so. He can live on the fat of the land, and have his hot suppers and his bottled stout, and his wine too! Who but he? And yet he thinks a crust of bread and cheese and a mug of table beer, is good enough for his brother that earns all the money that keeps you both!"
               "Nay, nay, Goody—you are mistaken there!" interposed John. "William, earns more money than I do; and of course he has a right to spend it as he likes. Besides, his health is so delicate that he requires nourishing food, whereas anything does for me, because I'm as strong and hearty as a horse."
               "Don't tell me!" cried she impatiently. "I knows what comes in, and I know's what goes out. And I knows what you earns pretty nigh to a penny. I don't mean to say I knows what William earns; trust him for letting anybody know that! He's too close, a deal! But I can tell you that your earnings keeps the house, and something over, and but little of it goes into your mouth, or on to your back, I reckon."
               "I don't like to hear you say such things, Goody, and I hope you will not repeat them," said John, with the nearest approach to displeasure which he was capable of expressing towards the old woman, who had been almost a mother to him and his sickly brother. "William of course keeps the accounts, for how could I do it? And you may depend upon it the money is much safer in his hands than it would be in mine. So say no more about it. How is the little girl? I have not asked after her yet."
               "She's all right, poor little lamb!" replied Mrs. Palmer; "she woke up awhile ago, and began crying for her mammy; but I gave her some bread and milk, and got her off to sleep again. I say, Mr. John," she added, confidentially, "whose child is she?"
               "I don't know," said he "and I don't think William knows, either."
               "He not know!" she retorted, in accents of derision; "trust him for that! You 
                     wont
                     won't
                   get me to swallow that, Mr. John. Would William have kept out of his warm bed, and gone up yon bleak hill on such a bitter night as last night was, and all to pick up a child that he knew nothing about?"
               "Yes, of course he would, if he knew the poor little thing was there."
               "Of course you would; but it's not of course he would. You don't know him so well as I do, I see. Do you know," she continued, in a confidential undertone, "her linen's as fine as fine can be, and her frock and everything is beautiful. Silk, and lovely work, and lace, good enough for a duchess's child. And even to her little bit of a pocket-handkitcher, everything is marked all alike with a B and a L."
               "Indeed!" exclaimed the blind man, manifesting a sudden interest in the old woman's gossip, "B and L! That is strange!"
               He sank into deep thought for a moment, but seemed about to make some inquiries, when William's impatient summons called him away.
               
               "Why are you gossiping with that old fool down stairs?" demanded William, sharply, "I told you that I wanted to be at the office early, and for that very reason, I suppose, you would let me lie here till doomsday. What has that old witch been chattering about?"
               "Nothing very important. I asked how the little child was, and she said the poor thing had been crying for her mother."
               "Is that all?"
               "She also told me that she had given her some food, and lulled her off to sleep again."
               "Humph!" grunted William, and proceeded to dress, with his brother's assistance.
               While William was seated at his breakfast of excellent tea, 
                     daintly
                     daintily
                   made toast, fresh butter and of oat-meal porridge and milk, from which the new laid eggs, and John was eating his bowl cream had been skimmed for William's tea, Mrs. Palmer entered with her little charge in her arms.
               As she approached William, however, the child, who had become tolerably reconciled to her new nurse, shrank from him in the utmost terror, and clung convulsively round Mrs. Palmer's neck.
               "There—there—there—dearie! Don'tee cry," said the old woman, soothingly; "he won't hurt you. He'll give you a bit of sugar, if you ask him pretty."
               "I don't 'ike 'him," sobbed the little creature. "Mama! Mama!"
               What a different effect did this heart-rending cry produce on the two brothers!
               "Take the brat away! I can't bear that noise!" cried William, impatiently.
               But John started up, and held, out his arms towards the spot whence the sad sounds proceeded, uttering a low, inarticulate murmur of compassion.
               It was the language of nature; and the child, so fresh from nature's hand, understood it in an instant. She suddenly threw herself from the old woman's arms, upon the ample chest of the blind man. His arms closed instinctively around her, and she turned, as conscious of being in a citadel of strength, and cast glances of defiance at the object of her dislike and terror.
               "Take the child away, Mrs. Palmer," repeated William, angrily; "such an ill-behaved little monkey! She's a perfect nuisance!"
               But, probably for the first time in his life, John opposed his brother's wishes.
               "No, no," he exclaimed, "don't send her away! The little darling! Only think of her coming to me of her own accord! Am I not very ugly, dear?"
               "No—oo pretty," replied the little creature, patting his face with her tiny soft hands. Him ugly," she added, pointing towards William.
               John was pained by her contemptuous allusion to his brother, but he could not reprove so dainty a little lady, so he hastened to change the current of her ideas.
               "Will you kiss me, little pet?" he asked.
               
               "Iss," said the child, suiting the action to the word. "Me wont tiss oo," she continued, firing another broadside at her adversary.
               "How much longer is this tomfoolery to last?" said William. "I must beg of you, John, to restore that child to Mrs. Palmer, and finish your breakfast. To-day, at least, I must trouble you to push my chair to the office. But in all probability, this will be the last occasion on which I shall be compelled to ask you to perform such menial drudgery."
               For a few moments John stood motionless as a statue. The tears gathered in his sightless orbs, and rolled down his checks unheeded. William turned from him with a sneer, and coolly cracked his second egg.
               "If others can serve you better, Will," said John, in a tremulous voice, "let it be so."
               "Come, come! Don't make a scene, for Heaven's sake!" said William. "And now, if you have done with your sentimental mooning, I shall be glad of your help."
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               WILLIAM MORTON EXPLAINS HIS INTENTIONS.
               WILLIAM entered the late Mr. Lonsdale's house with the air of a master.
               He would not allow John to carry him in as usual, but contrived to make his own way by means of a pair of crutches, which he would have learned to use much more adroitly had he not always had his affectionate brother at his beck and call. He proceeded to the offices. The outer one was empty, for all business was at a stand-still in consequence of Mr. Lonsdale's death. The inner office, the lawyer's private sanctum sanctorum, was likewise cold and cheerless, and William's lips turned white with anger when he saw the empty grate. With some difficulty he reached Mr. Lonsdale's easy-chair, and dropping into it, rang the bell violently.
               "Why is there no fire here?" he demanded, in a voice rendered hoarse by passion, and the effects of the violent exertion from which he was still panting.
               
               "I didn't think there was none wanted, now the master's gone," replied the girl, whose eyes were red with weeping.
               "The master is changed, not gone. So there is no excuse for your neglect of duty. Light the fire immediately. I am the master now.
               "You!" she repeated, in derision. "Lord's sake! William Morton, how can that be?"
               "You will see how it can be," he replied with a sinister leer that was far more threatening than downright rage. You leave this house on the day of the funeral. I refuse to retain you in my service, for your impertinence and great want of respect!"
               "You'd better have waited till I asked you, before you refused," said the girl. "I've always lived with gentlefolks, and I've not come down in the world so low as to be obliged to take service with an upstart jackanapes like you."
               William grasped one of his crutches as though about to strike her with it, but a moment's reflection that this probably what she aimed at in provoking him, together with the disgraceful exposure of an action for assault, enabled him to control himself. He took a paper from the table, and pretended to examine it with great attention; and the girl, having no opportunity of irritating him farther, left the room in search of materials for making the fire.
               "Sit down and wait till she has done," said William to his brother, who stood beside him, looking very sad and uneasy; "I wish to speak to you before you go home."
               John obeyed in silence, and with an increased depression of spirit, for he felt that these words foreshadowed a separation from him whom he had always loved far better than himself. He remained motionless while the servant was bustling about the fireplace, while William coolly proceeded in his examination of the papers on the table. No sooner was the door closed upon the girl, however, than he turned briskly towards his brother.
               "As Mr. Lonsdale's will is to be read so soon, there is no breach of trust in telling you that besides appointing me his executor, he has left me his business and this house."
               "Why, you'll be a rich man, Will!" exclaimed John, while his frank, honest, face brightened up with unfeigned delight.
               "I hope I shall be moderately well off in a few years," responded William; "but this bequest does not make me so at present, by any means. It offers me a field for profitable labor, that is all; and increased labor too, let me tell you. Under these circumstances it will be desirable for me to live here, as I must be on the spot to attend to business. You could not very well carry on your work here, and therefore you will find it most convenient to remain at the cottage. I give up all the furniture to you; but you must request Mrs. Palmer to pack up my clothes and books, and I'll send a porter for them."
               
               "Why cannot I bring them to you, Will?" asked John, reproachfully.
               "I have told you already that I do not choose my brother to be my servant," was the conceited reply.
               "You know that it has always been a pleasure to me to be of use to you, Will," murmured John, almost inaudibly.
               "My good fellow, I do not doubt it," replied William, with an unpleasant, patronizing laugh; "but we cannot always go blundering along in this world, doing just what we like, and paying no regard to appearances. Even with respect to your own business, I would advise you to take an apprentice, or an assistant, so that you may be a master, instead of a mere laborer."
               "I should not like any company but you, brother," said John, in a husky, broken voice. "I would rather be alone with Lion. What pleasant, happy evenings we have passed together, when you have been studying aloud and I have listened to you while I made my baskets!"
               "Yes, yes," replied the other, superciliously, "we have had our moments of amusement, as well as our periods of toil and hardship. But there is really no time this morning, my good brother, to talk sentimentally about the past. I have all the details of the inquest, and the funerals to see to; and therefore you must excuse my giving you a hint to leave me to my not very agreeable duties."
               "I have a terrible feeling, Will, as though we were about to part forever."
               "Nonsense! Mere childish nonsense, John; that a man of your years and sense ought to be ashamed of. Shall we be farther apart than we have been every day for the last four years? You can come and see me in the evenings, if you like, unless I should happen to be engaged with any one on business; of course, you understand that. And remember this, John: If you should be called as a witness on the inquest, you need say nothing about that child. She was not killed, so the coroner cannot have anything to do with her. There is a little mystery about her; but I will guard poor Mr. Lonsdale's secrets as carefully as though they were my own. Take this sovereign to Mrs. Palmer, and tell her to buy the poor child some useful clothes; she cannot be dressed in future as she is now. Let them be such as a child in her own rank of life would wear. The little girl can remain with you while Mrs. Palmer is absent. On no account let her be taken into the town. Good-bye, John."
               "Do you really wish me to leave you, brother Will?" asked John, while the tears gathered in his sightless eyes and rolled unheeded down his cheeks.
               "You are only wasting my time and your own too, while you remain here," responded William, with heartless indifference. "And the longer you stay, the more you will work yourself up to make a scene. I therefore say, once again—Good-bye."
               And to put an effectual stop to his brother's expressions of natural, but, alas! wasted affection, he rang the bell.
               
               The entrance of the servant produced the desired effect, and almost choking in his effort to say good-bye, John groped his way out.
               The servant, the same who had exhibited such an independent spirit towards William, ran after him, and gently, guided him to the street door.
               "If ever you want a servant girl, Mr. Morton," she said, in a low tone, so that William could not hear her, "I should be so happy to serve you, sir, if you'd please to remember me. My name is Betsy Cooke, and my mother lives in Silver street. She lodges at the barber's, and takes in plain work, and everybody knows her, so you can always find me."
               "I heard you say just now that you would only live with gentlefolks, Betsy," said John Morton, with, a sad smile.
               "And I wouldn't wish to live with a better gentleman than you are, Mr. John. And if I'd known you'd been in the room, I'd have bitten my tongue off before I'd have sauced at your brother; for everybody respects you. And if ever you want anything done that I can do, Mr. John, I'd get up in the middle of the night to do it; which please remember."
               "I should be very ungrateful were I ever to forget it, Betsy. Good-bye."
               He pressed her hand, and took his way down the street, so familiar to him from long habit, that the want of sight was scarcely a hinderance to his progress.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               JOHN MORTON FALLS INTO A STATE OF DOUBT.
               JOHN returned home with a slow step, and a heavy heart. It was not alone that the time had come when, in the pursuit of their different avocations, he and his brother must surely be separated. It was the heartless indifference which William had displayed,—the satisfaction he had expressed at being able to dispense with his brother's help. Blind as he was to William's faults, he could not but feel all this severely. His own nature was too true and constant not to be shocked by such an absence of all natural affection.
               "If I had been lame," he muttered, half-aloud, as he made his way with less precision than usual, "I think I should have felt more regret at throwing aside a pair of old crutches that had served me long and well. Will never cared for stick or crutch when it had ceased to be of use to him, or he had got a better. But his brother's legs have been like his own since he was old enough to cling on my back, and yet he could—Ah! Will! Will! I'm afraid your heart is not so kind as your head is clear and strong."
               There was yet another vague suspicion lurking in John's heart, which he tried to ignore and stifle; but which, in spite of all, would make its unwelcome whisper heard, though it hinted doubts of William's probity. That child—who was she? Who were her parents?—Mr. Lonsdale had appointed William his sole executor and guardian to his orphan niece,—where, then, was that niece?—And who was this child, with the initials B. L., marked on her clothes? How came she in Mr. Lonsdale's carriage with his sister-in-law, unless that lady were her mother? And was it not also a mother's act, to place her child in safety, when the maddened horses were dragging the carriage and its occupants to destruction?
               These doubts and questions rose unbidden in John Morton's mind during his walk homewards. The more he tried to evade them, the more pertinaciously they started up like ghostly spectres in his path; and when he strove to confute them by counter-arguments, they only took more tangible forms, and assumed fresh strength and vigor.
               He entered his cottage in anything but a happy or peaceful state of mind. Lion came bounding to meet him, and in his rough gambols and caresses would have been in danger of knocking down a weaker man than his master; and John found his first drop of comfort amid so much bitterness, in the reflection, that for the future his one true friend need not be kept chained up, on account of William's real or affected antipathy.
               "I'm glad you're come home, Mr. John," exclaimed Mrs. Palmer, coming out of her own cottage, and opening his door for him. "I haven't known what on earth to do about dinner. William gave me no orders, and he gave me no money before he went away. I can't think what's come to him. He don't generally forget to say what he'll like for his own dinner neither."
               "He's not coming back, Goody," said John, infusing as much cheerfulness as possible into his tone; "he has a great deal to do about poor Mr. Lonsdale's affairs, besides the inquest and funerals."
               "How is it he has more to do with the business than any of the other clerks?—Mr. Mason's been in the office many years longer than William has."
               "Mr. Lonsdale seems to have had a very high opinion of William, for he has left him his house and business, and appointed him his executor, and the guardian of his niece."
               "He's gone for good then!" cried the old woman, lifting up both hands in amazement, "and he could go away without saying a word to me, or so much as telling me of his good fortune! Me, that nursed his poor mother when he came into the world, and was as good as a mother to him all the long weeks that she lay between life and death, and he was a poor weany little thing, with scarcely a flicker of life in him! And him to go away without saying so much as good-bye to me! Ah! Mr. John! He used to say you had a soft place in your head, when you'd give away your own meal of vittles to a hungry beggar; but I'm sure he's got no soft place in his heart, and it would be well for him if he had."
               "You know, Goody, that William never likes a fuss; and it is not as if he had gone quite away. We can go and see him any day, and he can come here as soon as he has a new chair."
               "I'll tell you what, Mr. John," said Mrs. Palmer, placing her arms a-kimbo, and looking defiance at the world in general, "I've saved up five pounds ten shillings, to put me decently under ground when I'm dead, but the first time that William comes here—unless it's to fetch something that he has hidden away—I'll spend it all in a treat for the infant-school children! There now!"
               Before John could accept or decline her challenge, the attention of both was attracted towards the dog, who, bristling up his back and showing his white teeth, uttered a low growl, and made a rush towards the door.
               "Lord sake! What ails the dog?" she exclaimed, running after him. "O, it's the beggar-man! Call him off, Mr. John, or he'll tear him to pieces!"
               But, warned by the sounds of conflict, John had already summoned Lion to his side, where he stood growling and trembling, eager for permission to spring again upon the unwelcome intruder, who, seeing that the dog was under control, and that his master was blind, instead of taking to his heels, commenced a series of rather abusive demands for compensation for his torn garments, and also for food, or money to buy some, having eaten nothing, as he repeatedly asserted, in a stentorian voice, for the space of three days.
               "Three days!" repeated Mrs. Palmer, scornfully. "I'll be bound you had a good meal this morning. O, yes! You look like a man that's starving, don't you? Be off with you, or I'll let the dog on you again. What business has a great hulking fellow like you to come begging of poor folks that have to work hard for their living?"
               "Nay, nay, Goody," said John, "if the poor man's clothes are torn, give him some of mine. You'll find some in my bedroom. Give him enough to compensate for the damage he has received." 
               Knowing by experience that it was of no use to argue with John in a case like the present, Mrs. Palmer was obliged to obey his directions, which she did, however, with no very good grace, after warning the tramp that if lie moved a step during her absence, the dog would fly at him.
               The beggar received the clothes sullenly, and still demanded something to eat, asserting, in spite of his sonorous voice, that he was on the brink of starvation, and could not eat a coat or a pair of trousers.
               "Give him some bread and cheese, Mrs. Palmer Palmer," said the kind-hearted John, "it is dreadful to think of one of God's creatures wanting food."
               "God's creatures!" repeated the old woman in a low tone; "but there—you can't see him, or you'd see he was more like one of the devil's own brood. I shouldn't a bit wonder, if he was a ticket o'leaver."
               "The more reason to preserve him from farther temptation."
               "Ah, well! That's you all over, Mr. John. You'll give your coat off your back, and then you'll give your shirt, and after that you'd give your skin to the next owdacious beggar that wanted it."
               She said this while she cut a large slice of bread and cheese, which she gave to the tramp, who grumbled out his thanks, and moved off.
               "Stop! stop! You needn't go there!" she cried, seeing him approach her own door. "That's my place, and I've got nothing to give you."
               A sudden gleam of intelligence flashed like lightning across the hang-dog countenance of the beggar; but he was apparently hard of hearing, for he continued to shamble towards the object he had in view, and was inside the cottage before Mrs. Palmer could stop him.
               "Don't you hear what I say to you?" she cried, catching him by the sleeve. "This is my place, and I've nothing to give you, so get along with you."
               "Well, Missus, there's no harm done," said the fellow, without stirring a step, and casting his eyes furtively all round the interior of the cottage. "I'm rather deef, but that aint my fault, I suppose; so don't be so hard on a poor chap. I aint a-going to do no harm."
               "Then go and do it somewhere else," was Mrs. Palmer's logical reply.
               "Eh dear!" he groaned out, "you be oncommon hard, and oncommon sharp, to be sure. But you've been the means of giving me clothes and meat this day, and so God bless you for it! Would you give me a drink of water, mum?"
               Mrs. Palmer stared. She had not expected this burst of gratitude, and what is more, she felt that she hardly deserved it; so without a word, she went out at the back door, drew a jug full of water from the pump, and brought it to the tramp, who had occupied the interval of her absence in an accurate examination of the fastenings of the said back door.
               He took a deep draught of the water, and after expressing many grateful thanks, went his way, eating his bread and cheese as he walked.
               "And now," said Mrs. Palmer, reëntering John Morton's cottage, "it is high time that I saw about something for your dinner, Mr. John. What shall I get?"
               "Really, Goody," he replied, feeling in his pockets, "I must be contented with bread and cheese for to-day, for I have no money till I take some baskets to the shop."
               
               "Ugh!" grunted the old woman, indignantly, "so William's taken all the money away with him I suppose. That's all he cares for his brother! However, I'll take the baskets, Mr. John, if you'll mind the child. Poor little lambkin! There she's been hiding behind William's chair all the time that man was here. Come out, my pretty! There's nobody won't hurt you now! There! She looks sleepy, bless her heart. And its about time for her nap too. Let her lie in your arms, Mr. John, and tell her a little story. I've made up the fire all right, and Lion will tell you if anybody comes. I'll fetch you some eggs and bacon; that'll be quickest done. These are the baskets, I suppose. Yes, six of them, and beauties they are too. If Mr. Simpson is out, I'll leave them, and I can get what's wanted, and you can pay me to-morrow, or any other time. Good-bye."
               With a final glance around, to see that all was right, she took her departure, and after locking up her own cottage, she set off into the town to dispose of the baskets, and make her purchases.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               JOHN'S MEDITATIONS.—ANOTHER VISITOR.
               GENTLY rocking the little girl in his arms, John Morton sat by the fire in William's arm-chair, which he had taken more for her accommodation than his own.
               Instead, however, of telling her a story to lull her to sleep, he began to ask her some questions.
               "What is your name, darling?" he began.
               "Bessie," she replied, readily.
               "Bessie what?"
               "Bessie,—I Bessie,—I mamma's own, own, OWN Bessie!"
               "Are you Bessie Lonsdale?"
               "Iss. I mamma's own ittie Bessie Ondale. I want mamma!" she sobbed, with that tremulous protrusion of the under lip which, under such circumstances, conveys a horrible despair to the heart of the spectator who knows that the appeal must be made in vain, that the mother, so fondly called upon, lies cold and senseless, and can never respond to that plaintive cry.
               
               For once, John Morton's blindness was a blessing to him. It spared his tender heart a cruel pang. Yet the voice pierced his soul, and he hastened to divert her thoughts from dwelling too much on her separation from her mother.
               "Where is your papa, Bessie?" he asked.
               "In a picture. Mamma show him to Bessie. Such a pretty papa, in a red coat."
               "He was in the army, then," said John to himself, "that is another fact gained. Were you in a carriage with your mamma, Bessie?"
               "Iss,—in a team coach, and uncle's coach too. Uncle's horses jump so. Frighten poor Bessie. And a great dog came, and licked Bessie's face, and made her warm."
               Farther questioning elicited nothing more than this; which was, however, sufficient to convince John Morton upon two points,—the first, that little Bessie was a niece of Mr. Lonsdale's;—the second, that if she were the only niece, or the one to whom he had bequeathed the greater part of his property, William must contemplate acting a very treacherous part towards her. Else, why should he deny her relationship to the lawyer? Why should he wish her to be kept, in a manner, concealed at Mrs. Palmer's, till he could take her to her friends? Why should he, crippled as he was, take her to them, instead of sending for them to fetch her? Why did he give directions to have her clothed in coarse garments? An order by the way, which he had forgotten to transmit to Mrs. Palmer, and, in fact, now, thought of for the first time since he had left his brother. He felt for the sovereign, which he had placed in a pocket that he never used for money lest he might pass it in mistake for a less valuable coin, and had thus missed it when he was searching for the where-withal to purchase his dinner. It was safe and he returned to his anxious ruminations on the mystery that surrounded his nursling, who, in the meanwhile, as he knew by her relaxed limbs and regular breathing, had fallen into a sound slumber.
               Very sorrowful were the thoughts that crowded his brain; and many were the plans that he formed for the child's protection from wrong and danger, and afterwards rejected, either as impracticable, or as being far too elaborate to combat an evil which, after all, was but chimerical as yet.
               While he was lost in this maze of doubt and conjecture, a heavy step approached the cottage door, and the hard banging of Lion's tail upon the ground on which he lay extended, showed that it was no unfriendly foot.
               "Can that be Mrs. Palmer back already?" thought John. "No—it is much too soon for her."
               The latch was raised, and a loud voice exclaimed, "What cheer, messmate?" At the same time the dog arose, and welcomed the intruder.
               "Come in, and welcome," said John, "I cannot see you, but my dog tells me you are an honest man."
               
               "Blind, eh?" replied the visitor. "I'm sorry for that. What's darkened your daylight?"
               "An illness, when a child. I can remember seeing my mother's face, but very little besides."
               "It's a comfort to have seen that. Some that have eyes can't remember so much. The kid's not blind, I hope?"
               "No; but she's not my child. Is she pretty?"
               "So pretty, that I thought she could not fail to be your own; and you are one of the finest and handsomest chaps I ever clapped eyes on. I wish you'd got your sight, and was cap'n of the fore-top on board the Billy Ruffin. Blow me, though, how you'd get laughed at if you blushed at being told you was handsome, as you are doing now."
               "I'm not used to it," said John, laughing; "I was never told so before."
               "You seem to be alongside of a tidyish bit of a town here," said the sailor; "where do the girls live, I wonder?"
               "There are plenty of them everywhere," replied John; "but they don't take the trouble to pay me compliments, I assure you."
               "It ain't much of a compliment to say you're handsome, and they say it behind your back, if they don't to your face. And don't the folks tell you this here doggie's handsome?" he added, caressing Lion's noble head. "What breed do you call him, now? A mastiff?"
               "Yes. A Mont St. Bernard mastiff."
               "You don't say so!" exclaimed the sailor, drawing ing back. "What, one of them that saves people out of the snow? I feel as if I'd made too free with him, in patting his head."
               "O, no!" replied John, laughing again at the sailor's simplicity, "he is a good fellow, without any family pride about him; and, what's more, he knows an honest man from a rogue by the sound of his step. That is how I knew you to be an honest man, though I can't see you."
               "Yes, I'm proud to say I'm not ashamed to look dog or man in the face. But I shall be, though, if I don't answer to my name when the muster roll's called. I've been to London, and got amongst the landsharks. Lost all my money, and have to walk back to Portsmouth to join my ship. I hailed you, to ask my way; but that was seeking wool in a goat's house. So good-day, comrade."
               "Stay," said John, "I can direct you as well as any one. There is no way better than the high road; and you'll find that at the end of this lane. Turn to your left when you leave this door, and to your right when you reach the road, unless you wish to enter the town."
               "Not I," replied the sailor. "I shall come athwart some little country inn along the road, that will suit me better than a fine town hotel."
               "Stay yet a moment," continued John. "Do you understand what they call tattooing?"
               "I should say I did," rejoined the tar, with a chuckle "if you could see my arms—they are all over tattoo marks."
               
               "Can you do it?"
               "Most of the marks I've got, I did myself."
               "Is it painful?"
               "It smarts a bit, when the gunpowder's rubbed in. It's the saltpetre, you see."
               "Will you make a mark on this child's skin, by which she may always be known, even after she is grown up?" asked John, with a little hesitation. "It is for her own advantage that I want it done."
               "Isn't it a pity to wake her, poor little thing? She won't like the pain either."
               "She shall not feel it," said John. "In the cupboard by the stairs, you will find a small bottle marked chloroform. Give it to me—I know how to use it."
               "Then I've got no gunpowder," said the sailor, who was evidently reluctant to perform the operation.
               "That also, you will find in the cupboard. There is some in a cup, that Mrs. Palmer uses for some purpose in her wash-house. And do not fear that you will get into disgrace by the delay. There is a third-class train at seven o'clock this evening, that stops at the station only two miles off. It will take you to Portsmouth in a few hours, and I will gladly pay your fare, if you will oblige me in this matter."
               "You mistake me, my hearty," said the honest fellow; "it isn't that I should have to peg away a little harder to make up for lost time; but I don't like to hurt that little cherub, that's the truth of it."
               "I promise you that you shall stop the moment she cries out," said John; "will that satisfy you?"
               "I suppose it must. Now, how's this here stuff to be managed?"
               "Pour ten drops on this handkerchief. But first we must decide on what the mark is to be."
               "Shall it be her initials, or a hanchor?"
               "Does the anchor always look like an anchor?" asked John, feeling rather dubious concerning the graphic skill of his nautical friend.
               "Natural as life!" exclaimed the other. "I only wish you could see this here beautiful little one on the back of my left hand."
               "An anchor then let it be. It is the emblem of hope; and I have it done with hope for her future benefit. But don't make it on her hand. Let it be somewhere out of sight."
               "On the top of her arm, near the shoulder, will be a good place, I'm thinking," said the operator.
               "Yes; here, under her sleeve," added John, feeling the little sleeper's arm. "Get ready, and I'll tell you when to begin. The chloroform first. Ten drops, mind." 
               The chloroform was carefully administered.
               "Now begin," said John, "but if she starts at the first touch, you must wait for a few minutes."
               John felt that the rough sailor was trembling; but as the operation went on without any signs of suffering on the part of Bessie, he became more self-possessed, and finally pronounced his performance ance to be as neat a bit of handy-work as he had ever set eyes on.
               Shortly after its accomplishment, and while Bessie was gradually arousing herself from the joint effects of chloroform and sleep, Mrs. Palmer returned with her marketings.
               "What! Another visitor, Mr. John?" she exclaimed, as she entered.
               "Yes, Goody; but a very different one from the last," he replied. "This good man has rendered me an important service, and I should like to offer him some dinner if you can manage it."
               "O, yes! That's easily done, if he can eat eggs and bacon," she replied, after a glance at the stranger's honest face.
               "That I can, Missis, and thankful for it too."
               Whereupon she bustled about, and assisted by the sailor, who proved himself an able coadjutor, she quickly placed a clean and savory repast upon the table.
               When the meal was over, the visitor asked leave to smoke his pipe, and offered his host a bit of prime "baccy," which John smoked with great relish; though as he took it he said, with a sigh, "Poor Will is not here to be annoyed by it now."
               "Poor Will indeed!" muttered Mrs. Palmer, as she cleared the dinner-table. "I've no patience to hear him! Will didn't dislike the smell. He only begrudged the expense."
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               A FIRESIDE CHAT.
               THE sailor was gone, and little Bessie, who had several times during the afternoon complained of a pain in her arm, was put comfortably to bed in Mrs. Palmer's cottage. The labor of the day was over, and the old woman, by John's invitation, brought her knitting to his fireside, that he might talk over his projected domestic arrangement with her, before proposing it to his brother.
               For a wonder, John's hands were idle; for a greater wonder still, he was smoking;—smoking, too, for the second time in one day. It was, as Mrs. Palmer said to herself, a thing unheard of. It is true he kept a pipe and a small jar of tobacco in her house, and once or twice a week, while William was at Mr. Lonsdale's, he would take a few whiffs by her chimney-corner, so that his dainty brother should not be annoyed by the smell when he returned home. But to sit down to a regular smoke like this!—Well, after all, she was glad to see him make himself comfortable, and he had a good right to have done so long ago, and set that would-be fine gentleman at defiance.
               Such was her reflections as she settled herself comfortably down to what she dearly loved,—a quiet chat.
               "Did you remark what there was on Bessie's arm that she complained of?" John asked, after a short silence.
               "O yes! It's one of them blue marks that sailors and that has on their hands and arms very often. Him that was here to-day has got such another on the back of his left hand. I think he must have done this one on Bessie's arm, for it seems quite sore like."
               "Yes. He did it at my request. I don't know how it is, Goody, but I feel very anxious about that child. Perhaps it is because I love her so much. But I'm afraid she will be stolen, or lost; and so I asked him to tattoo an anchor on her skin, that we might know her by it when she is grown up."
               "William's going to take her to her friends, isn't he?"
               "So he says; but I doubt whether she has any. And that reminds me, Goody, of what I wanted to say to you this evening."
               He then explained to her his project for setting up housekeeping together. She fell in with his views readily and thankfully.
               "As far as I can see, there's only one objection, our having the care of Bessie, Mr. John," said the old woman; "William won't agree to it. You'll see if he does."
               "I can't see why he should refuse," he replied; "he intimated to me that she had no very near relations; and she would be quite safe here, and off his hands."
               "But don't you know that when once he takes a thing into his head, the devil himself (God forgive me!) can't drive him away from it?"
               "That's true," responded John, with a sigh.
               "Aye, and it is true too; and has been ever since he was a baby in arms."
               "Poor fellow!" sighed John, compassionately, "he is so afflicted, and so delicate!"
               "Is he worse afflicted than you, Mr. John—I should like to know? And as for being delicate, how was he delicate? Tell me that. He never had a day's illness. It was only his greedy, fantastical appetite that was delicate. So he'd feast on the best and daintiest, and leave you to eat oatmeal porridge and dry bread. Oh! I've often wanted to speak my mind about it; but between the two of ye, I could never get a word in."
               "And don't, now that you have me at your mercy, there's a dear old Goody!" said John. "I've thriven well on my plain fare," he added, slapping his muscular leg, "so there's nothing to complain of. Let bye-gones be bye-gones."
               "And yet I've a mind to tell you about some other bye-gones, Mr. John. You say you've a feeling that Bessie may be stolen; and I've got a feeling that I'd better get this off my mind tonight."
               "What is it, Goody?"
               "Why, about your mother, and your coming here, and all that."
               "What is there to tell? You told William that you knew nothing, when he asked you the other day."
               "And I'd tell William so again," she replied, resolutely. "You are the eldest, Mr. John; and your rights stand before his, any day. Only because you are blind, and so soft-hearted, and good-natured, and never suspecting nobody,—least of all your own brother,—you'd let your rights be taken out of your mouth, just as he's done with everything since he was old enough to grab at it."
               "What rights are you talking about, Goody?"
               "There now! I don't know for sure that there are any; at least not rights to property. But you've a right to another name any how; for your name's not Morton, no more than mine is."
               "What do you mean? What is our name then?"
               "I'll just begin at the beginning, and tell you all about it. It was just twenty-three years ago, and about a month after my poor dear husband was taken to a better world; and I was sitting alone by my own fireside, making a new black gownd for myself, and crying all the time to think how lonely I was, and it was in there next door, in the very same little place where I've lived in ever since, and where I had hoped to die, if Providence had thought fit,—but it seems it's not to be so,—when there came a gentle knock at the door. It was a rainy, windy night, I remember well; and as dark as pitch, so I hardly liked to open the door, for the place was lonesome, and the house next door was empty, that's this house, you know,—and not a soul was there nearer than the turnpike. So my heart jumps into my mouth, as it were, and I sits and listens. Presently there comes another knock, a little louder than before, and I thought I heard a child begin to cry. 'Well!' thinks I to myself, 'if there's a Christian outside, I'm sure there's not a Christian inside, if I can sit and hear such sounds as them without opening the door in such an awful night.' So with that, up I gets and opens the door; and before the wind blew the candle out, I caught sight of a lady, dripping wet, leaning against the door-post, with a young child in her arms, almost dropping out of them, she was so weary and faint; so I catches the child in one hand,—I'd the candlestick in the other—and says I, 'come in out of the storm.' And as quick almost as I spoke, I put the child down on the settle, and the candlestick on the table, and ran back and helped her in. Well,—by great good luck I had a little drop of gin in the cupboard, and I mixed some, hot, and made her drink it, and that brought her round a little; and she asked if I could let her have a bed, and some food for her child, and she pulled out her purse, and showed me she had money. So I says, 'don't trouble yourself, ma'am, (for I saw at a glance she was a real lady) for out of my doors a dog shouldn't turn this night,' I says, 'money or no money. And I hope I knows the duty of a Christian,' says I, 'which I have known sorrow and trouble myself,' I says, 'being a widow.' Well—with that, she was very thankful; and I made her up a comfortable bed, as anybody would wish to lie in; and the little boy I took to sleep with me, that his poor mother might have a quiet night's rest. But we hadn't been a-bed above two hours, when her cries awoke me. Up I jumped, you may be sure; and before daybreak your brother Willy was born. And there I I was, with the poor dear creature, and the two babies,—for you was only a year old,—and nobody to send for a doctor nor nothing. However, by good luck, I saw a man passing down the lane, and I got him to send the doctor, and a woman that I knew; and so we got some baby clothes, and we managed, and got on as well as could be expected. And when your poor dear mother began to get about again, nothing would suit her, but she must have this cottage, and live in it. So I did all her errands for her, and bought the little bit of furniture she wanted, and all that, for she never would go into the town herself. And here she lived, like a nun or an hermit for five years; and then you took ill with the fever, and she took it, nursing you. And she died, poor soul, and you lost your blessed eyesight. As for Willy, he never catched the fever at all."
               "But, Goody," said John, who had listened attentively to the garrulous old lady's narrative, without once reminding her that she had often told him all this before, "there is nothing in this that you might not have told to William, or anybody else."
               "No, not so far. But there's something else to come, that I've never opened my lips about to any mortal person. When your poor dear mother lay a-dying, she calls me to her, and she gives me a bundle of papers, and says she 'give these to John when he comes of age. They will show him who he is. There's money left enough to bring them up till they can work for themselves. John will always take care of his poor little brother; (she didn't know you was blind, poor dear! I hadn't had the heart to tell her!) teach them to be industrious, though what poor Willy can be, I don't know. But I'd rather see them tailors or shoe-makers, or any honest trade, than I'd see them in the power of their wicked father.' She wanted to say a good deal more, but the end came on too fast, and she was prevented. She gave me a name, though, written on a slip of paper, which was to be entered in the parish register when she was buried, and that I gave in, quite correct."
               "What was that name?"
               "That I couldn't quite make out, even then, and I've clean forgotten it now. I never was much of a scholard, and hand of writ fairly puzzled me at that time. I've no doubt, though, it's all right in the books. She lies buried at Medlicote, you know; for we're not in one of the town parishes here. Dear heart alive!" she exclaimed, starting up, "why it's just on eleven o'clock! Who'd have thought it? Here's the papers, all safe. I brought them in with me on purpose to give them to you to-night, as, I ought to have done three years ago; but I knew, if I did, you'd just hand them over to William, and if there was anything to be made of them, he'd manage to get it all for himself."
               "Nevertheless, Goody," said John, gravely, as he received the packet and placed it safely in his breast pocket, "you ought not to have suffered any such consideration to prevent you from fulfilling my mother's dying request."
               "Well, now, don't be vexed with me about it; I did it for the best, and you see I've not lost a moment, after your faith in William was a little bit shaken."
               "I'm not vexed with you," he replied, with his usual good-natured smile;—"are you going? Had you not better bring the child in here, and sleep in William's bed to-night?"
               "No, thank you, Mr. John; I'll move my things in to-morrow, and I don't like to leave my place unprotected."
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               A NIGHT OF TERROR.
               JOHN accompanied Mrs. Palmer to the door, partly to let Lion have a run in the lane, and partly to give the old lady the assurance of human companionship, as she passed out of one little garden gate into the other. It was no great distance; the space railed in, in front of the cottages, and dignified by the name of a garden, was only three feet wide, and the doors were not a dozen yards apart, for one roof covered both the dwellings; but it was cheering to hear his pleasant voice talking to her till, she closed her door, after a last caution to him to go to bed at once, for his fire was nearly out.
               He called in the dog and sat down by the dying embers, notwithstanding her injunctions to the contrary. Never in his life had he felt so utterly alone; never had he felt so completely in darkness.
               After sitting for some time beside the empty grate, till the external cold seemed almost to rival that which pressed so heavily on his heart, John arose and went to bed.
               
               Lion hardly understanding how it was that he had permission to remain all night with his master, gambolled about like a lively young whale, and finally deposited himself by the side of his bed, with a bang that shook the floor.
               John was soon asleep in spite of his sorrows. It is a habit which the industrious acquire, that of making the most of the few hours of repose they allow themselves. Besides he had scarcely slept at all during the previous night, and if left to himself, he would probably not have stirred till his usual time for rising in the morning. But he had not been in bed more than a few hours, as it seemed to him, when he was awakened by Lion pulling the bed-clothes off him, and uttering low growls, expressive of considerable uneasiness.
               John pulled the clothes over him again, and mumbled out a sleepy command to the dog to lie down. But Lion, in general the most docile of dogs, positively refused obedience. At one tug all the coverings were on the floor, and John, convinced at last that something must be wrong, started up in bed, and listened.
               As he did so, there fell upon his ears a distinct, prolonged, but smothered scream of "murder!"
               Instantly John slipped on his trousers and coat, pushed his bare feet into his shoes, and rushed down stairs.
               The sound had seemed to come through the wall from Mrs. Palmer's cottage.
               As he opened the door, Lion pushed past him. He listened again. There was no sound. The cry of murder was not repeated. Perhaps Mrs. Palmer had called out in her sleep. At all events he could not go to bed again till he had ascertained whether anything was amiss. He felt for the door, and was about to knock, when it gave way before his hand. He entered hastily, and stumbled over some object that lay upon the floor, between the door and the stairs.
               He stooped and touched it. It was warm, but inanimate. There was a hand, a face, a shoulder, some scanty hair, falling from under a flannel nightcap—long hair, a woman's hair—and what was this clammy fluid that covered his hands? He smelt it, and shuddered. And what was that noise that he heard? A crackling, like a newly-lighted fire and that smell of smoke that filled the room! The crackling sound came from the room above, and there the child, his dear little Bessie, lay, unless she too had been murdered.
               He bounded up the stairs, half-stifled by the smoke that rolled in great wreaths about him. He felt on the bed. She lives! she lives! Whether wounded or not, he cannot tell. He rolls a blanket round her, and bears her safely out into the lane.
               Then the thought struck him that poor Mrs. Palmer might be still alive, and even if dead, he could not leave her body there to be consumer in the burning house. He laid Bessie on the around, and at the risk of being stifled by the smoke, or killed by the falling timbers, he returned and brought out the corpse of his poor old friend, which he laid by the roadside, at a distance from the burning building, the heat from which now became almost unbearable.
               Then he took the child in his arms, and prepared to carry her to the town, and call assistance to extinguish the fire.
               And Lion—where was Lion? He called him in vain, and here arose another source of anxiety. Perhaps his noble dog had been struck dead by the escaping murderer—struck down by one blow from, a hatchet, or other heavy weapon, and might even now lie dead or dying, within his reach, if he could but see him! Among all his surmises it never occurred to this brave heart that the murderer might be even now standing close by with uplifted axe or hammer, ready to strike him dead.
               He carried Bessie a little way down the lane, away from the immediate roaring of the conflagration; then stopped, again called his dog, and listened.
               Hark! there is some news of Lion now. Over the fields to the left comes a yell that is scarcely human, mingled with a howl that is more than canine. Then a confused hubbub—growling, scuffling, and smothered yells.
               John shouted to Lion to desist and come to him. Presently, with many anxious barks, that had withal a dash of triumph in them, Lion came bounding to his master, but expressing, as plainly as dog could, how very desirous he was for permission to go back and finish the little job he had on hand.
               John kept him by his side and hastened on. But before he turned into the road the sound of many voices fell upon his ears, and in another minute he was in the midst of a crowd of people, all hurrying to the fire.
               "Make haste! make haste!" he exclaimed; "I fear poor Mrs. Palmer has been murdered! She is lying by the side of the road"—
               Before he could say more, his voice was overpowered by a confusion of shrieks and exclamations, in which the words, "It's the dog! it's the dog! Look at his paws and his muzzle! He's all over blood! Shoot him! shoot him before he kills any one else!"
               Encumbered by the child, but fearing that this brutal cry might be responded to by one of those ruffians who are always ready to act on such orders, John convulsively clutched Lion with one hand, and raised his powerful voice till it was heard above all the din.
               "No! no!" he shouted; "my dog followed and attacked the murderer. He will lead us to him. Some of you go to Mrs. Palmer, for God's sake! She may be still alive. Is there any woman here who will take charge of this child?"
               "I will take it," said a female voice. "I'm a policeman's wife—Joe Smart is my husband, and it will be safe with me."
               
               He yielded poor little Bessie, now wake and crying, into the arms of the woman, who hastened away towards the town.
               "And now," he said, anxiously, "has any one gone to see after Mrs. Palmer?"
               "You are all over blood yourself, mate," observed one rough looking fellow, surveying John by the light of a lantern; "how comes all that ere blood about you? I think we'd best make sure of him, anyhow," and he laid his hand on John Morton's shoulder.
               "Don't I tell you that I carried the murdered woman out of the house?" exclaimed John. "I felt her blood on my hands, though I could not see it, and of course it would be all over my clothes as well."
               "Never mind—you just come along of we. There's plenty gone to the fire, and we'll make sure of you, anyhow."
               "I don't want to run away, my good fellow, nor if I did, could I go far, being blind; but the murderer should be followed and secured. My dog was worrying him somewhere in the meadow leading to Deaconswood. He may be dead, or he may escape; I cannot tell how much, or how little he was injured, but while you waste time over me, who have no thought of running away, you may lose your chance of capturing him. Do any of you know the dog? If so, he will lead you to the place where he was fighting the man."
               "I knows him by sight, Master Morton," said a young rustic, "but I doubt he won't follow I. Here, Lion! Lion!"
               "Go with him, Lion!" said John. But Lion, probably perceiving that some peril threatened his master, pressed close to his side, and refused to stir.
               "What folly this is!" cried the captive, impatiently. "While you detain me here, the murderer may get clear off! Let me go with the dog. You can keep close by me, and we shall soon find him."
               "No, no," said the man who had first suggested that John should be arrested, and who was one of those rational-minded individuals who never abandoned an idea that they have once formed—"you come along to the station-house. We'll make sure of you, anyhow."
               Finding that it was useless to contend with such pig-headedness, John quietly yielded, and was led away in triumph to the station-house. The charge was duly taken by a stolid functionary, entered in proper form, and the blind man found himself the occupant of a police cell. Not the sole occupant, however. By a small bribe to one of the subordinates, backed, in all probability, by a naturally reluctance to come into collision in any way with so formidable an antagonist, Lion was permitted to share his captivity.
               Alone, except for the company of his one faithful friend, and in no greater darkness than was habitual to him, the blind man still felt a horrible consciousness that he was imprisoned.
               
               He was thoroughly convinced that he could not be detained for a single day on so groundless a charge; but the bare fact of its having been made was dreadful, and the sense of being locked up within four stone walls was like a fearful nightmare.
               Once or twice a policeman looked into the cell; and on one occasion he supplied the prisoner with the means of washing the blood from his hands. Subsequently, he informed him that the body of Mrs. Palmer had been brought in; that she was, quite dead when they had first discovered her, lying by the road-side as he had described, and that both the cottages were completely destroyed. After that, all was quiet in the station-house, the guardians of the peace being probably fast asleep.
               John, however, found it impossible to obtain a moment's repose. All the terrible circumstances of the night passed in review before him, and he lost himself in conjectures as to who could have borne the poor harmless old woman so much animosity as deliberately to murder her, for any idea of its having been done from motives of gain, was put wholly out of the question by the fact of her poverty.
               Suddenly flashed across his mind the recollection of the tramp, towards whom Lion had manifested so great a dislike, and he also remembered that just as the growling of the dog warned them of his approach, Mrs. Palmer was speaking in rather loud tones of the sum of money which she had saved for her own burial.
               When he lighted upon this clue, he could scarcely refrain from calling the police, and urging them to set out again in pursuit of the murderer; for in answer to his anxious inquiries respecting his capture, he had merely learned that nobody had been found in the field, and that a further investigation would probably take place by daylight.
               It was some consolation to be able to throw any light on the affair, and he began to feel more composed, and recalled, with sorrowful satisfaction, the last conversation he had had with his poor old friend. Then he thought of the packet of letters which she had confided to him, and he felt hastily in the pocket where he had placed them, to ascertain that they were safe.
               "How fortunate that I caught up my coat!" he said to himself, as he drew them forth; "if I had run down without it, these papers would have been burnt!"
               And here a fresh source of anxiety arose. He had been searched for offensive weapons, on his arrival at the police-station, but his papers had not been taken. In the morning, however, it might be different, and those letters, which perhaps contained important family secrets, might be made public. He had no alternative but to send as early as possible for his brother, who, in his capacity of legal adviser, would be admitted to a private interview, and to, place them in his hands.
               He tried to convince himself that this was also the proper course to pursue in order to establish any rights which might be indicated in their mother's documents. But, do what he would, he could not feel completely satisfied.
               John unfastened the packet, and tenderly fingered the papers. Tenderly and reverentially—for his mother's hand might have traced the characters with which they were, doubtless, covered. I know not whether an impulse akin to self preservation prompted the act, or whether it was simply a desire to possess some memento of the mother whose sweet face was almost his sole recollection among the objects, which he had seen with his external organs of sight,—but after, handling the documents for some time, he selected one—it was the smallest, and the paper was the finest and smoothest—and after carefully folding it into a small compass, he concealed it under the lining of his coat. His sense of touch was so delicate that he was able to do this with the utmost accuracy.
               When this was done, he felt more at ease, and after tying up the rest of the papers, he stretched himself upon the hard mattress which had been laid on the floor for his bed, gave his faithful dog permission to share it with him, and so snatched a brief and troubled sleep.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               BROTHERLY LOVE.
               AS soon as the occupants of the station were astir, John sent a message to his brother, requesting him to visit him immediately. The messenger met William on the road, in a state of deep distress and agitation, which, to his credit be it said, was not wholly due to the disgrace which would attach to himself on account of his close connection with a man accused of murder, but was in part owing to real concern for the dilemma in which his good and kind-hearted brother was placed.
               "It must be a mistake," he reiterated to every person whom he encountered, "it is utterly impossible that John could have any hand in such a dreadful crime. He is the best-tempered fellow in the world; and besides, he was very much attached to poor Mrs. Palmer."
               And so, though the snow was falling fast, he proceeded in his wheel-chair to the police station.
               "Oh, Will! I was sure you would come to me!" exclaimed the prisoner, in a tone which plainly indicated that till that moment he had been doubtful about it.
               "Of course I would come. It was too late when I heard of it last night; but I came away this morning as soon as it was light. How could you doubt that I would come?"
               "I didn't doubt it—I did not really doubt it, Will. But everything seems so strange, that I could fancy the world was turned upside down, and the most unlikely things would take place. Who could imagine that poor old Goody would be murdered? Why, she had not an enemy in the world! And then, who could suppose that I should be suspected of killing her?"
               "You must tell me, straightforward, all that you know about it," said William, taking out a note-book and pencil to make memoranda from his brother's statement.
               "Are we quite alone?" demanded John.
               William replied by bidding the young man who had pushed his chair, to wait outside until he was called.
               "It was hardly wise of you to say that," he remarked, when the door was closed; "the desire for secrecy gives the appearance of there being something to conceal, which may tell against you. You should have intimated your wish in a more cautious and roundabout way."
               "That is of no consequence," replied John, "it is merely a family matter that I wish to speak about in private. As for the charge against me, it can't stand a moment's fair investigation."
               "In these cases, we can never be too cautious in giving the faintest color to an accusation once made. It is far easier to arouse suspicion, than to allay it. What is this family matter that you wish to speak to me about?"
               "Last evening Mrs. Palmer gave me a packet of papers, which had been confided to her by our mother, to be given to me when I came of age. I hardly know why she did not do so three years ago; but I suppose it was from the idea, that so many appear to entertain, that because I am blind, I must be treated like a child. We had some conversation also, which I will repeat to you another time. I am only now anxious to entrust these papers to your keeping, lest they should be taken from me. There they are."
               "What are they?" demanded William, in a calm voice, though his eye glanced eagerly over the: words, Will, and Marriage Settlement, which appeared on two of the documents.
               "I have no idea, but I conclude that they relate to family affairs."
               "Had Mrs. Palmer read them, or shown them to any one?" demanded William.
               "She could not read hand-writing easily; and she was too careful to allow any one else to see them."
               "So—that's well!" said William, opening the Packet. "Now tell me all about the occurrences of last night."
               
               While John related all that had happened, beginning from the time of his being aroused by the dog, and glancing back to the visit of the beggar at the very moment when Mrs. Palmer was speaking of her little hoard, William took a more minute survey of the documents which he held in his hand. As he went on, his naturally pale complexion turned to that of a corpse. His thin lips quivered, and his breathing became so rapid, that he had great difficulty in concealing his emotion from his brother. And all the while his eyes gleamed with fierce delight, yet from time to time glanced eagerly around, to see that no one was near to observe him.
               When poor John's narrative was ended, William allowed a portion of his agitation to become manifest. Pressing his brother's hand in his own, which was cold, clammy, and tremulous, he said, in a low voice: "I must come again, John, I can hardly take all this in at once. I am quite upset by the frightful events of the last two days. First, there was poor Mr. Lonsdale's death, and the fearful amount of labor and anxiety which it entails upon me. And now our dear old friend, our second mother, so horribly murdered; and you, my beloved brother! in this den of iniquity, lying under the suspicion of such dreadful guilt!—O! it is too much for me! Too much, at least, for this wretched fragile body. Ah! were my physical only equal to my mental strength, I could endure all these trials with more composure. But I cannot!—I cannot!—I am now quite ill, and I shall be utterly unfitted for the performance of my many arduous duties, if I overtask my strength any farther at present. As it is, I greatly overestimated my own powers when, in my anxiety to afford you my advice and countenance, I hastened hither, without having broken my fast. May God bless and protect you, my beloved brother!" he added, in a voice that was broken, as it seemed, by sobs. "I will be back again in time for your examination before the magistrate. Rely upon me. If I have to get up from my death-bed I will be by your side throughout this trouble!—God bless you! Henry!"
               This summons, in the same shaky, husky voice, brought in the young servant, and the single word "Home," uttered in a tone of deep despondency, and with his forehead bowed upon his hand, comprised the whole of his instructions.
               For a long time John sat exactly as his brother had left him, with his head inclined upon his breast, and his hands hanging listlessly the right just as William's clammy, nervous gripe had dropped it. Strange, mistrustful thoughts crowded upon his mind; thoughts, for entertaining which he could have hated himself.
               His brother's words of affection had fallen upon his ear, but not upon his heart. He could not help it, yet he reproached himself bitterly for his inability to do so.
               While he was still buried in these painful reflections tions, two policemen entered, to remove the mattress, and summon him to breakfast. They both observed his air of deep dejection and the expression of remorse which dwelt too plainly on his tell-tale face, and they exchanged sharp glances of intelligence, anything but favorable to the prisoner.
               It is difficult, even for a newspaper editor, writing coolly, with fixed principles before him, and the awful and ever-present 
                     conciousness
                     consciousness
                   of being, to a great extent, the guide and regulator of public opinion, to keep in view the rule, that every man must be considered innocent until he is proved guilty; and with people of less regulated minds it is simply impossible.
               It is not therefore surprising, that the two functionaries jumped to the somewhat hasty conclusion that John Morton's guilt was as good as proved of by this fit of deep dejection after the interview with his brother and legal adviser. They likewise, not unnaturally, coupled the prisoner's depression with William's ill-concealed agitation, and were not in the slightest degree astonished when, on being brought before the magistrate, John received a message to the effect that his brother was attacked by a serious illness, which confined him to his bed, but that he had engaged the most able solicitor in the town to conduct his defence.
               Notwithstanding all that this gentleman could do, however, and he exerted himself to the utmost, John was remanded for a week. In vain he protested that the real murderer had been at least half-killed by Lion in the field opposite to the cottages. The field had been searched on the previous night, by the help of lanterns, and signs of the supposed fray discovered; the ground was now covered by deep snow, which rendered farther search impossible for the present. John's proposal to go with the dog and find out the exact spot, was treated with cool contempt, and Lion would accompany no one else.
               The prisoner was therefore remanded for additional evidence, and for the result of the coroner's inquest. It was only for week! Ah! How easy it seems to those who are dressed in a little brief authority, to consign a fellow-creature to captivity for a week. It is but a short time; but how does the prisoner feel it?
               John was taken to the house of Detention, where Lion was not permitted to follow him; so he left him under the care of the policeman's wife, who already had charge of Bessie, and to whom the dog had taken a liking, and went to his new quarters without a murmur.
               He sent no message to William, nor did he even make any inquiries about him. But he felt for the paper that he had secreted, and devoutly hoped that his dead mother's spirit had guided his hand in the selection, and that there was in it the clue to his family and his rightful name.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               WILLIAM MORTON REFLECTS.
               THE time passed drearily for poor John Morton. Liberty was as dear to him, as to those who have greater facilities for enjoying it; and in his own way he appreciated the beauties of nature more keenly than many who can gaze face to face upon her loveliness. Above all, idleness was hateful to him, and on the second day of his incarceration he asked for, and obtained a supply of materials for linking baskets, and the occupation somewhat alleviated the tedium of imprisonment.
               He would not send to inquire after his brother, until he heard incidentally that he was confined to his bed by sickness.
               He heard also that an inquest had been held on the bodies of Mr. Lonsdale and his sister, at which William had not appeared, partly because of his indisposition, and partly because the evidence of The medical man and the people at the turnpike was quite conclusive.
               An event that concerned him still more nearly was the inquest held on the body of Mrs. Palmer. The verdict returned was an open one, of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.
               The woman to whom he had entrusted Bessie was his medium of communication with his brother, and he was not a little pleased and surprised when she brought him a message from William, offering to take charge of Lion. He did not hesitate a moment, but requested her to take the dog to his new quarters without delay, and, if possible, to obtain an interview with William, and to ask him to tell him, by her, what course he had better pursue in regard to his defence.
               Mrs. Smart, after two or three refusals, was at length admitted into a darkened back room on the ground floor, where William Morton lay in bed. His naturally pale face looked ghostly in the dim light, and with a faint odor of medicines that pervaded the apartment, impressed the good woman forcibly with the idea that the patient must be in a very bad way indeed.
               "I've brought the dog," she began, in a low whisper, "and John, he wants you to send word by me, because I may be trusted, what he'd best do about his defence. Them was his very words."
               "Trusted!" replied William in a tone of suppressed anxiety. "He should trust nobody! How much has he trusted to you?"
               "Why, Mr. William, he trusted me to bring that message to you, that's all."
               "Is that all?" responded the invalid, with a sigh of relief, as he wiped imaginary sweat-drops from his pallid brow. "There's no harm done then," he added, in a very low tone, yet not too low to be caught by the quick ears of the policeman's wife. "Attend to this message, Mrs. Smart," he continued, aloud, after a few moment's reflection, "and be sure that you deliver it, word for word, to my—to—to—to John Morton. Tell him that he cannot do better than trust his defence to Mr. Jarvis; and that the only advice I can send him, is, to say as little as possible to any one. I would come to him, if it were possible. You will recollect all that, will you?"
               "Oh yes, Mr. William—every word of it," she replied, "and what's to be done with the little girl? You see, I've no children of my own that she could be with, so it's a great tie to me having her to look after, and not sure of being paid, nor nothing, and nobody as I can exactly say to look to about it. It would come very hard upon me, being as I am only a poor hard-working woman, to have somebody else's child left upon my hands, when I have none of my own."
               "Of course it would—of course it would," said William, thoughtfully, "and I will take care that you are paid for your attention to her."
               "Thank you kindly, sir, I'm sure."
               "Poor little creature!" sighed William, without noticing the interruption, "I must provide for her, now that her father—humph!—Yes, you may feel quite easy about being paid, moderately paid, for taking care of her. But I think it would be better to send her a few miles into the country in some quiet, little village. Do you know of any person who would be willing to take charge of her?"
               "I can't call to mind that I do, at this present moment, sir. But I'll ask Smart. Perhaps he'll know of somebody."
               "Do so, and let me know the result as soon as possible. What clothes has she got on?"
               "Well, sir, she hadn't got nothing on when John gave her to me, but an old bit of a bed-gownd that had belonged to a grown-up person, and outside of that she was wrapped in a blanket. But Mr. John gave me as sovereign the next morning to get her a few things, which I did to the best of my judgement, buying such as I would have got for a child of my own, if I had have happened to have had one."
               "Quite right—quite right, Mrs. Smart. But a sovereign would not go very far, even, for a child's outfit. She must have a small stock of clothes, neat and plain, and nobody can see to that so well as yourself, if you will be good enough to take the trouble. Her clothes were all burnt in the fire, I suppose. She was always neat and clean when I saw her, during the few weeks that poor Mrs. Palmer had her in her cottage."
               He drew a purse from under the bolster, and counted five sovereigns into the woman's hand. Her eyes glittered as the shining coins dropped with a musical chink into her thrilling palm.
               
               "When that is spent," said William, in a languid tone, "let me know what you have bought, and what more is required. I must be left alone now. Every exertion, even the slightest, is too much for me."
               "Thank you kindly sir," said Mrs. Smart, dropping a profound courtesy, "but can't I do nothing for you, sir?"
               "Not now, thank you. But when you come again, to-morrow or the next day, you may be able to serve me. Good-day."
               "Good-morning, sir, and wishing you better, I'm sure."
               And with another courtesy at the door, she made her exit.
               The invalid lay quite motionless till the clang of the outer door warned him that she was gone; then raising himself briskly into a sitting position, he rang the bell, and ordered the servant who answered it, to draw back the window curtains, and place a decanter of port wine by his bedside. The woman, he casually remarked, had brought a message from his brother which compelled him to exert himself.
               After drinking a couple of glasses of the fine old wine, he drew a large pocket-book from beneath his pillow, and while his long, lithe fingers played with the fastening, he meditated on the visit he had just received.
               "That woman may be made a useful tool," he muttered, half-aloud; "how her eyes glistened at the sight of the gold! It would not take much to buy her, body and soul, and there is no one to outbid me. With respect to the child, at all events, she will save me an infinity of trouble and anxiety. And then, if John should be acquitted,—Ah!—As long as that if stands in my way, I can see nothing distinctly. Nothing, but that one point that I must and will attain, at whatever cost!" And his delicate white fingers fiercely clutched the pocket-book and shook it defiantly, as though daring fate itself to oppose his projects. "I wish, however, that I could banish the possible contingency from my mind! But it is impossible! It will intrude, always with the same terrible supposition,—if he should not be acquitted! Well—and if he should not be acquitted—what then? How can I help it, one way or another? They say it is an easy death; and it would certainly simplify matters wonderfully for me. It might be the best thing for himself, poor fellow; for such a state of existence cannot be productive of much enjoyment. I'll not think about that!" he said, with a shudder, as he hastily poured out, and drank another glass of wine.
               He spread out the contents of the pocket-book and proceeded to read over several papers and parchment deeds, with a great deal of care and attention. They were those which he had received from his brother.
               "If—If," he muttered, "still that if! But which-ever way it turns, I think I see my way to make all clear. Should the sole obstacle be removed by the law, every difficulty is at an end. But if it is not so removed, I must employ other measures. I must have his signature here. Forty thousand pounds bequeathed by John Conyers Fortescue to his beloved nephew Henry Conyers Fortescue, to be enjoyed by him for the term of his natural life, and at his death to pass to the said John Conyers Fortescue's dearly beloved niece, Arabella Fortescue, now Arabella Fitzgerald, the wife of Marmaduke Fitzgerald, of Northleigh Hall, in the county of Northumberland, Esquire, for her sole use and benefit, coverture notwithstanding, et cetera, according to the usual form; and so on, to the eldest son of her body—as if we ever heard of souls having sons!—And there we come to the point. This money, this forty thousand pounds, hard cash, and it comes to the eldest son of Arabella Fitzgerald, whom I take to have been our respected mother; without any shackle, or restriction or proviso whatever. No doubt the old bloke thought he would steer it safe past the clutches of our venerated father; and from all I have been able to find out about him, during the last two or three days, he was perfectly justified in so doing. Now this money all comes to the eldest son, therefore the eldest son must draw it out; it can be done by degrees, so as not to call attention to the little game, and the poor eldest son shall have all that he wants, in some comfortable asylum for the blind, while the younger will visit the German Spas, and consult all the most eminent surgeons and physicians, with the hope of recovering, if possible, from the one blemish of his being.
               "There's landed property besides," he added, taking up another document, "which might doubtless be recovered. But Northleigh is heavily mortgaged, and one cannot handle land, as one can funded property. At all events, I must leave that till a future time, when I can feel my way cautiously and safely. I have a delicate game to play, and might lose all by one precipitate step. Though, if the law decides against John, Northleigh Hall—my mother's fortune—everything is mine by right."
               There was a cruel gleam of hopeful avarice in his keen eyes, as he said this.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               JOHN REGAINS HIS LIBERTY.
               IT is doubtful whether the days, and ours, and minutes, which composed the week during which John was remanded, pressed more heavily upon the heart of the innocent captive, or upon the feverish, scheming, restless, avaricious spirit of his brother.
               That William sometimes felt compunctious visitings for abandoning his noble-minded brother in a hand-to-hand combat for his life, can hardly be doubted; but a glance at the will of John Conyers Fortescue sufficed to subdue all qualms of conscience.
               Yet it was doubtless with a grateful sense that he was saved by the fates in which he so blindly trusted, from complicity in a crime, that he heard one morning, that during the night the frost had broken up, the snow had melted, and traces of a desperate encounter between a man and a dog, easily recognizable by the footprints in the soft clay soil, corroborated John's account of the murder. Once on a new scent, the police had started into fresh vigor, and, a few fields off, they came upon the foot of an old stocking, which exactly corresponded with the leg of one that had been found tightly, clutched in both hands by the murdered woman.
               She had, no doubt, lost her life in defending the little hoard which she had accumulated to provide for her burial.
               Following still on the same track, the police discovered that on the day following the murder, a man, whose description answered to that of a tramp who had been seen in Tattleton for some days previously, had called at a lone farm-house, and begged for old rags to bind up his wounds, having been set upon, as he said, by several dogs, at a place a few miles in an opposite direction, and nearly torn to pieces. Inquiries made on the spot, however, proved this story to be false. A farther clue, though a faint one, was obtained to the subsequent movements of the suspected person, and the police were in great hopes of laying their hands upon him, though the long interval which had elapsed since the murder greatly increased his chances of escape.
               The effect of this diversion of suspicion into another channel was, that when John Morton was brought up a second time before the magistrates, he was discharged from custody from the failure of evidence against him, and placed in the witness box.
               
               He gave a plain and satisfactory account of the affair, and answered every question in a straight-forward manner that convinced all present of his entire freedom from complicity in the crime.
               As soon as John was free to depart, he hastened to his brother.
               The house was closed and silent, for the bodies of its late proprietor and his sister still lay in a chamber above awaiting interment.
               "My dear John!" exclaimed William, in accents of vexation, "how could you come through the town in broad day-light, in such a dreadful plight? And to come to this house, of all places! You should have waited till it was dark."
               "I did not know that my appearance was so discreditable," said John, cut to the heart that his brother's first words should relate to his clothes, "but everything was burnt in the fire. As for coming here, Will, I thought only of coming to you; but I will go away again, as you do not want me. I can always get work, thank God!"
               "Nonsense!—nonsense!—Where are you going, you foolish fellow?" cried William, assuming a tone of affectionate remonstrance, which, it is to be feared, he little felt. "Stay where you are, John. But for Heaven's sake don't show yourself even at a front window, till you have some new clothes. I expect the tailor every moment, and he shall take your measure. I suppose you thought me very unkind to notice your appearance before asking about your escape from those idiots of country justices," he added, seeing that the cloud still hung upon his brother's brow, "but, my dear boy, I knew all about that nearly as soon as you did. Jarvis's clerks were trotting backwards and forwards the whole time."
               "Forgive me, Will," said the placable John, clasping his brother's hand in both his own. "I did think it rather unkind, and that's the truth; but then I did not know that you had heard anything of the proceedings."
               "I should have been shamefully indifferent to your fate had I not made myself fully acquainted with them at every step," said William, gravely. "And no stronger proof exists of the terribly painful interest I felt, than the fact of my having been laid on a sick-bed in consequence. And now I feel myself so much restored by the turn that affairs have taken, that I really think I shall get up, in spite of the doctor's prohibition."
               William accordingly arose and dressed himself with the assistance of a servant, declining John's proffered aid; and after a plain but comfortable dinner, they sat quietly talking by the fire-side.
               Never had the behavior of the younger man towards his brother been so kind and considerate, and John's warm heart expanded in the genial rays, like a flower in the sunshine.
               As he passed his hand mechanically over the paper that had belonged to his mother, his conscience reproached him for having abstracted and secreted it from dear, good, kind Will. However, as he felt for the hole in the coat-lining through which he had inserted it, he almost accidentally asked his brother if he had read the papers which Mrs. Palmer had given him, and what were they about.
               "I glanced hastily over them," replied William, "and they seem to be merely common-place letters and accounts, of no earthly interest to any one. I have not had time to read them through."
               John's hand dropped.
               "I should like to hear them, nevertheless," he remarked.
               "Of course—that's quite natural," said William, "and I'll read them over to you one day."
               "Is there any mention of our real name?" demanded the elder.
               "Oh! That's one of poor old Goody's bits of romance," said William, laughing; "as far as I can see, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that we have a right to claim any other name than that we have borne all our lives."
               "I am rather sorry for that," observed the blind man, musingly.
               "Why should you be sorry for it? Morton is a good name enough."
               "Aye—there is nothing amiss with the name,—but still I should like to be rid of it, somehow, after the disgrace that has been attached to it; though they say that's all wiped off now."
               "It is easy to say that," said William, bitterly, "but I never knew a case in which a character that had once been tainted by a criminal charge, ever completely recovered its place in public estimation."
               "It is impossible that anybody in their senses could believe me guilty of this horrid murder!" cried John, in a state of dreadful agitation; "you surely can't mean that, Will?"
               "You forget how very few people are in their rational senses. During the past week popular opinion has been equally divided on the question of your guilt or innocence; and now, though you are legally absolved from even a suspicion, there is no lack of charitably disposed people who are ready to set down your acquittal to my influence with the magistrates."
               John's candid face betrayed his incredulity.
               "It is indeed ridiculous," continued William, reading, and replying to the expression of his brother's countenance "and can only be accounted for by the exaggerated reports that have got abroad respecting the large fortune that Mr. Lonsdale has left me. They imagine that I have been bribing somebody. Now, I should like to know how I could have raised a sufficient sum to bribe an English Justice of the Peace? From an intimate acquaintance with Mr. Lonsdale's affairs I happen to know pretty nearly what I really shall come in for. There is this house—that is to say, the few unexpired years of the lease. There is the furniture,—plain and old-fashioned. There is the business, depending for its value on the caprice of the clients. And, finally, there is the residuary legateeship teeship, consisting of the scrapings, and pickings and odds and ends, that may remain after all the other legacies are paid; and which may amount to a hundred or two, or may dwindle down to a twenty pound note. I had hoped to be able to hold out here, till I could gather up the old connection or from a new one, and so keep on in the old place. But after this unfortunate affair of yours, John, I fear it would turn out a losing speculation; so I have almost made up my mind to convert everything into money, and go to London. Having a little capital at my command will give me a sort of independence, and enable me to hold my ground till I get a first rate appointment, such as managing clerk; or I might get admitted as junior partner in some respectable firm; but that depends on the amount I can produce, so I must not be too sanguine."
               "But why abandon this capital business, ready made to your hand, where you would be your own master?"
               "No, no. I cannot stay here. My feelings are over-sensitive, perhaps. But the fact is, I cannot remain in this town a day longer than necessary."
               "And all owing to my misfortune!" sighed John, in a tone of deep contrition.
               "Don't speak of that, my dear boy. I assure you such a thought never enters my head. I see the necessity for certain actions; but I don't blame the innocent cause. Besides, there is another inducement which we must not overlook. You will have educational advantages in town which you can obtain nowhere else. You can read the raised type pretty well, but you have no command of books here, as you will have in one of those magnificent institutions for the instruction of the blind, of which I have read so much, and to which it has long been my greatest ambition to be able to send you."
               "Dear Will!" exclaimed his grateful brother, "and you never said a word about it to me!"
               "Where would have been the use of raising hopes that might never be realized? No, John; that is not my way. And you have frequently, I doubt not, thought me unkind, and snappish, and exacting, when I have, in fact, been irritable simply because I could not see my way clearly to the attainment of this darling project. Now, however, your splendid talents will find the opportunity of expanding themselves. They have the knack, too, in those Institutions of teaching blind people to write."
               "That will not be very difficult for me to learn, I think," said John, his handsome face glowing with pleasure at his brother's unwonted, and unexpected kindness. "I can form all the letters pretty well, I believe."
               "Aye—and you can write your name very well too. Let me see if you have lost that accomplishment. Here are pen and ink and a sheet of paper."
               The blind man scribbled the page over with his own name and his brother's, written in perfectly legible, though rather straggling characters.
               
               "Why this is excellent!" exclaimed William, steadying his voice with an effort, while his blanched lips quivered, and his restless eyes glanced uneasily around. "Now try if you can write other words, as I dictate them. Here are some names in the newspaper. Write Jacob Smith. Very good indeed! Now write John 
                     Fortesque
                     Fortescue
                   Fitzgerald. Stop—there's no space on that paper—write it on this." And he took from a drawer a slip of paper with a government stamp on it, and placed it with a trembling hand before his brother.
               "Fitzgerald!" repeated John, thoughtfully. "How do you spell it, Will? It is very strange!" he added, dreamily, "I never heard that name before to-day, and yet it sounds familiar to me! How can you account for it?"
               "Easily enough," replied William, testily. "I remember its occurring in some story book that I used to read to you. But pray don't trifle now, John; I have a serious object in view, while testing your ability to write."
               "Well then," said the imperturbable John, "tell me how you spell Fitzgerald."
               But without waiting to be told, he wrote the name in the middle of the paper, spelling it with an s instead of a z, and so spoiled a stamp which would have rendered valid a power of attorney, and which cost, I believe, thirty-six shillings.
               William ground his teeth, for he hated every expense that did not minister to his own comfort or pleasure.
               "Hallo!" exclaimed John, feeling the stamp, "what's this?"
               "It's an old office stamp," replied his brother, taking it from him, and biting his lips with suppressed vexation. "Now write it again—in this place," and he adroitly substituted a similar paper for the one John had damaged,—"write it as I tell you, John Fortescue Fitzgerald."
               "You know that I can write John well enough; so I'll write Thomas."
               "My dear boy!" exclaimed William, laughing spasmodically, as he arrested John's hand in the act of spoiling another stamp, "don't I tell you I am putting your writing to a certain test?—Write exactly as I dictate. The very facility with which you write 'John Morton' may render it difficult for you to form other combinations of words. Fitzgerald and Fortescue are both rather difficult names to spell. Now pray oblige me."
               Good-natured John complied with his brother's whim, and signed the name of John Fortescue Fitzgerald to a paper which, when filled up with certain legal forms and phrases, would become a power of attorney, authorizing his brother William to act for him in all matters of business, and giving him entire control over the sum of forty thousand pounds, then standing in the funds in the name of the said J. F. F.
               Had William caused his unsuspecting brother to commit a forgery?
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               REMOVAL.
               THE next day the remains of Mr. Lonsdale and his brother's widow were consigned with great ceremony to the family vault in the churchyard of St. Mary Magdalene, at Tattleton.
               In the absence of any relatives, William Morton, in a handsome Bath-chair, hung with black, officiated as chief mourner.
               At nearly the same hour the mangled remains of poor Mrs. Palmer were carried to the little parish church of Upton-on-the-Hill. Her savings to pay for her funeral were gone. She had lost her life in defending them, as the old stocking, part of which was held in her dying grip, went far to prove. But the coroner and jury had raised among them nearly the amount requisite to bury her, and William Morton ostentatiously contributed the remainder, so that her funeral was quite as respectable as she had anticipated.
               In consequence of the circumstances attending her death, a large concourse of the lower orders followed her to the grave, though she had but two real mourners. These were John Morton and Lion; and it was difficult to say which seemed the more sincere in his grief.
               When all was over, John returned to his brother's house. William was already there, having had a much shorter distance to go, and was recruiting exhausted nature with a savory little lunch and a few glasses of wine; for, as he had shown even in his days of poverty, he had a keen appreciation of the good things of this life; and, in short, wanted nothing but opportunity to become a perfect gourmet. He invited his brother to join him, but John's heart was too sad to suffer him to eat. He drank a glass of wine, however, and tried to swallow a morsel of bread, which nearly choked him. The funeral had strongly impressed upon him the fact—which his own troubles during the week had partly obliterated—that his kind old friend, the protectress of his childhood, was indeed dead.
               "Poor old Goody!" he said, with a deep sigh.
               "Aye, she's gone," said William, in a tone that sounded almost impatient, "and as no amount of sighing and moaning can bring her back again, the less you sigh and moan, the better for other people, brother John."
               John was pained at his brother's levity; but as he always credited him with good motives, where possible, he set his present manner down to a desire to rouse him out of his gloomy reflections; and in order to second William's intentions, he asked him some questions about Mr. Lonsdale's funeral.
               
               "It went off very well—very well indeed," replied William, as though he were speaking of some performance that had been got up for the public amusement. "The service is very tedious, but I had the best of it there, for that Bath-chair is uncommonly comfortable. I must have one made like it, only with a few improvements that I can suggest. I was thinking them over while the clergyman was reading those interminable prayers."
               "Do they use the same service for the rich that they do for the poor?"
               "Of course they do, simpleton."
               "I thought it very solemn and impressive."
               "That's natural, because you were obliged to listen to it, and you have so little to occupy your mind, that everything you hear makes an impression on you, and amuses you."
               A fortnight elapsed, during which John remained an inmate of William's house, and much to his own vexation, in a state of idleness; for the young lawyer had become all at once far too aristocratic in his ideas, to suffer his brother to follow the humble calling of a basket-maker.
               But if John was idle, William was certainly busy. All Mr. Lonsdale's affairs were set in order, and the house and business sold to Mr. Jarvis, who was delighted at this opportunity of extending and improving his connexion. Mr. Lonsdale's private papers, clothes, &c., together with the trunks that had belonged to his sister-in-law, were all placed ready for departure, and one morning, before the town of Tattleton was astir, the two brothers started by an early train for London.
               I hope there may be some of my readers who will here ask the question, "What became of Lion?"
               I am sorry to be obliged to reply that Lion was separated from his master. John naturally desired that he should accompany him, but William overruled this wish by representing the extreme inconvenience of taking so large a dog into lodgings; but promised that as soon as they were settled in town, Lion should be sent for. To Mr. Jarvis he said, "You can keep the brute, if you like. He is a capital yard-dog. But if he is in your way, give him to some one else, or have him shot. He'll never be sent for."
               As soon as they arrived in London, William began to carry out his pre-arranged plans, which were near being disorganized, however, by John's urgent desire to return to Tattleton, and resume his old occupation of basket-making. The turmoil of the great city was inexpressibly distressing to him. He felt as though he were in the vortex of a whirlpool. While in town, one area railing was exactly like another,—and the noises were forever moving, varying, and unceasing.
               There was but one object, or series of objects, which counterbalanced all these miseries. These were the bridges, which gave him a good idea of the breadth of the river by the time it took to walk across them.
               
               This was an immense source of delight to the blind man; and he even went so far as to say that the acquisition of this idea was worth coming to London for. William smiled superciliously at the enthusiasm of the man who could love nature so well without seeing her; but he turned his brother's folly to his own advantage, and whenever John became so maddened by the hubbub that it seemed almost impossible to prevent his returning forthwith to Tattleton, the wily lawyer hired a boy, and sent him on a walking tour among the bridges.
               About a week after their arrival in town, William informed his brother, with every appearance of feeling the warmest interest in his future comfort, that he had at length found an Institution where he could be received and taught all that it was possible for him to learn.
               "I am sorry to say, however," he added, "that you will be obliged to work to support yourself."
               "I never expected anything else," replied John, cheerfully; "what can I wish for better than plenty of work?"
               "You might naturally expect that I should support you, and leave you all your time for study."
               "Not I, Will—not I!" exclaimed the other, interrupting him. "You well know that I never desired a life of idleness."
               "Yes, yes, I know that," said William, interrupting him in his turn; "but though you may not feel it as a hardship to be compelled to work for your living, I feel the hardship of not having it in my power to render you independent."
               "Rather say dependent, brother Will, if I subsisted on anything but my own labor, or my own property."
               "Property!" repeated William, hastily, while an expression of acute, anxiety shot across his thin features, "What property do you mean?"
               "None at all, since I possess none," replied John, cheerfully; "and therefore I will make myself independent by labor; and if, in the course of years, I save money by that labor, I shall possess property, sha'n't I?"
               "Ah! I see," said William, laughing, "I see where your property is situated. A very pretty castle in Spain at present. And that reminds me that the sooner we set out to lay the foundations of the edifice the better. It is very good of you to be so contented and cheerful under difficulties, my dear brother. I wish I could feel the disappointment as little as you do."
               "I don't understand what you mean, Will," said John, with an air of perplexity. "What disappointment can there be, when all is as well, or better than we expected? If we had known a month ago that Mr. Lonsdale would die, that our house would be burnt down, and everything we possessed burnt with it, should we not have said that we must be left beggars on the face of the earth? Yet through Mr. Lonsdale's kind remembrance of you, you are enabled to bring me here, and obtain an entrance for me into this Institution, where I shall be able to study, and work, and be independent, while you, but you have not told me yet what your prospects are; only I know they must be better than when you were only a lawyer's clerk."
               "Not so good—not by any means so good," replied William, sighing profoundly; "if I could have remained at Tattleton, and nursed up Mr. Lonsdale's business, I might indeed, in the course of some years, have made something of it. But I was obliged to part with it at such a sacrifice that the proceeds are now almost expended."
               "Almost expended!" 
                     exlaimed
                     exclaimed
                   John, in consternation. "Oh! Will! Will! what have you left to live upon?"
               "I have the promise of an excellent situation, which now don't laugh at the idea of such a poor cripple travelling about,—will compel me to go abroad. My expenses will be paid, and I shall have the advantage of visiting one or two places in Germany where there are mineral springs which may have a beneficial effect on my lameness. I shall come back, no doubt, as poor as I set out but it is worth trying for the sake of the waters."
               "And I shall be able to send you some money to help you, Will," cried his brother eagerly. "Of course I can earn more than will suffice for my own wants, just as I did at"—he checked himself suddenly, and blushed. He was on the point of reminding his brother quite inadvertently, that he had supported him while a boy, and to a great extent after he became a man, in their old home at Tattleton.
               A spiteful, malicious glance, shot from William's eyes; but his voice as low and dulcet, as, laying his hand caressingly on his brother's, he said, "I do not think I shall require any assistance, dear John; but if I do, you may rely upon it, I will not hesitate about letting you know of my necessity."
               "You have not told me," said John, anxious to change the subject, though he acknowledged his brother's acquiescence by a warm pressure of the hand—"you have not told me your reason for not keeping Mr. Lonsdale's business for yourself."
               "Why should you want to know?" said William, gloomily. "And yet, it is perhaps best that you should, in case that you might ever entertain the idea of returning to Tattleton. I left the town because I could not remain in it after our name had been stigmatized by the awful charge which had been brought against my brother. You are innocent, John! I know that—and you need not repeat it. You were acquitted of the charge also or rather the accusation was withdrawn. But there is a true old saying, that where mud is thrown, some will stick. And for the future, our name is a marked one in our native place; and, though they held aloof, out of compassion for me, let me tell you once again, John, what you were so loth to believe when I told you of it after your release, there are many in the town who still believe you guilty, and as long as the actual murderer remains undiscovered, the number will increase. Not for worlds would I have you return to Tattleton. As for myself, if I had had to crawl out of the town on my crutches, with but one penny to buy my first crust upon my weary journey, I would have set forth alone, and a beggar, rather than remain there in comparative comfort. Will you give me your solemn promise, John, to remain quietly at the Institution, and above all, not to attempt to return to Tattleton, or communicate with any one living there, until my return from Germany?"
               "Why should I promise not to do what I have not the remotest intention of doing? There is no need to give any promise, Will. You know as well as I do, that there's no chance of my going to Tattleton, or leaving the place where I can work and study in peace."
               "I can suppose that you are sufficiently alive to your own interests to follow my advice," said William, "and therefore a formal promise may be dispensed with. The time is drawing on when we shall have to part, John. The manager of the Institution is to call for you at twelve, and it only wants ten minutes of the hour. Is there anything else you wish to say before he comes?"
               "Yes, yes!" exclaimed John, eagerly, "how are we to communicate with each other?"
               "I hardly know," said the other, thoughtfully.
               "I have reflected on that point, and cannot come to any conclusion. We cannot communicate when apart, with any sort of privacy, as a third party must always intervene to read my letters and to write yours. Under these circumstances it will be best to reduce our correspondence to a minimum, and agree not to write, unless in a case of extreme emergency. Such a case is certain not to arise on your side, as you will be stationary and safe. Therefore, let it remain thus—that if any remarkable circumstance occurs, I will immediately write to you."
               "Let it be as you will," said John, rather sadly; "but I hope, my dear brother, that you will remember that the slightest improvement in your strength will be a remarkable circumstance to me, and the most interesting that you could possibly communicate."
               "I'll not forget. Such an event would be too important to myself for me to overlook it."
               "There is yet another point on which I should like to be satisfied, Will. That dear little child, Bessie, what has become of her?"
               "She was quite safe and well when I last heard of her," replied William, without a moment's hesitation. "In accordance with instructions, I had received from her—from those, in short, who had the right to dispose of her—I sent her to her natural relatives. She arrived safely, and as I told you, was well and happy the last time I heard of her."
               "Whose child is she?" asked John, simply.
               
               "I cannot answer that question, without violating the confidence reposed in me by a dying man," said William, with a solemnity of manner that was intended to put a stop to farther questions. "Hark! there's a knock at the street door! That is Mr. Simpson, no doubt. He promised to be punctual."
               The clock on the mantel-piece struck twelve, and Mr. Simpson was shown in. He was a man of a sort of semi-appearance, with a plausible manner, and an anxious expression of face, as though his whole life were devoted to the eager pursuit of some object.
               He was introduced to his new pupil, and at a hint from William's, eye, professed to be in a hurry. William desired to cut the leave-taking as short as possible.
               John was deeply agitated, and desired to kiss his brother at parting, but William pushed him back, whispering, "Don't be so childish."
               That was quite enough.
               "Good-bye, Will," said John, in a strong, manly tone, without a quaver in it; "if I don't hear from you in a few days, I shall conclude you are off without accident. God bless you, old fellow! And I trust you will derive all the benefit you expect from the German waters."
               He walked straight down stairs, Mr. Simpson followed, and they drove off in the cab in which the latter gentleman had just arrived.
               And so the brothers parted, for the second time.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               WILLIAM ASSUMES A NEW CHARACTER.
               WILLIAM listened till the sound of the wheels was lost in the general noise of the street. Then ringing the bell, he desired the servant to bring him the bill for the lodgings, and to request the driver of the Bath-chair to be in readiness.
               He was quite in a hurry to be gone; and as soon as he was seated in the chair, and the attendant had dispersed the mob of idle boys who had of course collected to witness the operation, he breathed freely, and glanced eagerly and hopefully around. His luggage, consisting of Mr. Lonsdale's handsome trunks and portmanteau, with the plates bearing that gentleman's name carefully removed, though no others were substituted, was next brought out and placed on a cab. He took the cabman's number, and directed him to take the luggage to an old-fashioned, but highly respectable hotel, where it was to be placed in certain rooms on the ground floor which he had already engaged. He also took the precaution of paying the man. handsomely before he started, so that no questions might be asked respecting the place from whence he had come.
               "What name, sir?" asked the cabman, looking for labels.
               "They'll know me best as the lame gentleman," replied William, with a faint laugh, "there can be no mistake about me, unfortunately. I almost wish," he continued to himself, as he followed the cab—"I almost wish that I had sent it first to a railway station, and so entirely broken the trail. I must think well about the name. The battle is now beginning in earnest, and the results of every movement must be carefully weighed and considered. A step, such as I contemplate, once taken, can never be retraced. And it must be taken, or finally abandoned as soon almost as I enter the doors of that hotel. Shall I wait till after dinner, and think it over quietly then? No—I'll decide first. John Fortescue Fitzgerald, Esq., or William Morton Fitzgerald, Esq., will enjoy his dinner more, and probably be more respectfully waited on, than plain Mr. Nobody. "I'll go into the Regent's Park for an hour before returning to the hotel, Smith," said he aloud.
               "Very good, sir," responded Smith.
               "Go slowly," said William, when they reached a tolerably quiet part of the Park, "I want to reflect at leisure on a difficult subject."
               The pace was slackened, and William's meditations were not interrupted.
               It would be difficult to follow the workings of that busy, toiling brain, through all the devious windings that it threaded during the long silence that ensued. There was an object which he was bent upon attaining; and there were two ways of reaching it. Whichever he might choose, he foresaw that it was beset with difficulties and dangers, and his interest was to select that which seemed least likely to end in failure. This was the subject that occupied his thoughts; this was the problem that he was bent upon solving.
               Instead of following out his various processes of reasoning, I will simply state the case, and the conclusion at which he ultimately arrived.
               The object which he had in view was the undisturbed possession of upwards of ¥50,000, the principal and interest of a legacy which had been left to his mother, with a reversion to her eldest son, by an uncle, who, as William had ascertained since he came to London, had died about the period of his own birth.
               The two modes of attaining this object were either to forge a power of attorney, empowering him to act for his brother, who, on account of his blindness, could not be supposed capable of transacting business for himself, or to ignore theoretically his own existence, and practically that of his elder brother, and by claiming to be the veritable eldest son of his mother, to inherit the property in his own right. It is needless to say that the information respecting this rich inheritance had been conveyed to him by the documents that John had given him in the police cell.
               The objections to these two modes of proceeding were these:
               To the former—that forgery was an ugly word, involving, if discovered, still uglier consequences. A second reason was that there was some landed property to come to the eldest son, which he could not become possessed of by a power of attorney, nor by a forgery, but only by being the eldest son. It was merely an old tumble-down Hall, and a few hundred acres of worn-out, impoverished land; but William's avarice was insatiable, and his habitual prudence had much ado to restrain him from risking all the richer prizes by grasping at this poor shadow.
               The objections to the second course were, that it presented greater complications and risks of exposure, by the chances of inquiries being made at Tattleton, by an inhabitant of that town seeing him in London using his brother's Christian name—by John taking it into his stupid head to go to that equally stupid old west country town; altogether the balance at last turned decidedly in favor of the forgery as being by far the simpler and neater proceeding of the two.
               "And after all," he reflected, "no one could prosecute me for it but John himself, and he would never do it. What if I could induce him to go into a monastery in Belgium, where they would keep him safe as long as I paid them well! No, no, I must have nothing to do with that. He would not prosecute me for forgery, and even the charming, British public would say nothing, unless the facts were thrust in a startling manner under their very noses; but woe unto me if they caught me in the act of interfering with his personal freedom! They'd be oft me, full cry, like a pack of hounds. Let John remain where he is. He is very comfortable; and he is really incapable of any enjoyment beyond what he will have in that excellent Institution. Of what use would all this money be to him? What could he do with it? Nothing. Now I can both use it and enjoy it, and as I am quite as much my mother's son as he is, it is just as much mine by right, as his. I see that my first idea was correct, and as I have his own signature to the deed, I really don't see how it could be made out to be a forgery at all.
               "Back to the hotel now, Smith, as fast as you like."
               "Very good, sir," responded the man, and moved briskly southwards.
               "Stop at this watchmaker's shop, and request some one to come out and speak to me,"
               He selected an expensive watch, with, chain and appendages; requested that some trivial alteration should be made, which would take about a quarter of an hour, after which it was to be sent to the hotel, and paid for.
               On his arrival at his hotel, he was lifted into his room by Smith and the porter, and Smith was dismissed for the day.
               
               "What is the gentleman's name?" demanded a waiter, as he went out.
               "Don't know," replied Smith.
               The waiters eyed each other dubiously. A few moments later the watchmaker's parcel arrived, addressed to William Morton Fitzgerald, Esquire, and the waiter who was called in to get the change saw nearly a hundred pounds paid for the trinkets.
               This was duly reported, and William Morton Fitzgerald, Esquire, sipped his wine after dinner with the agreeable 
                     conciousness
                     consciousness
                   of having assumed his new name, and started in his new character, in a quiet, unobtrusive way, that would be sure to escape remark, or comment of any kind.
               He had many subjects for serious reflection during that after-dinner cogitation; many nice questions to settle in his own mind, before they were carried out into action. By a single inadvertency or oversight in the present stage of his proceedings, all his projects might be delayed or even thrown into disorder; and that was what he desired, above all things, to avoid.
               One of his first steps, he resolved, must be to deposit the proceeds of the sale of Mr. Lonsdale's house and business in some substantial bank, where his money would be taken as a sufficient guarantee for his own respectability. He thought longingly of Coutts, or Drummond's; but their rules were too strict; they would demand an introduction, which he could not obtain; so he prudently abandoned the idea till a future occasion.
               "I am laying the foundations of my fortune," he murmured to himself, "and not a stone must be misplaced."
               As soon as his banking account was opened, he intended to use the power of attorney which poor John had 
                     unconciously
                     unconsciously
                   signed, to sell out ten thousand pounds' worth of stock, and place it in the bank in his own name. He would take no more at present, for it was his determination to be cautious in all things. Then, as he had no wish to give up the profession of the law, he must take measures to have his real name entered on the rolls, a matter of some little difficulty as he had been articled to Mr. Lonsdale as William Morton. There are few things, however, that ability, backed by money, will fail to accomplish; and he speedily saw his way out of this dilemma.
               He must take a house also, in such a locality that it would serve as a professional, as well as a private residence; and so constructed that there would be ample space for offices on the ground floor, without encroaching on the dining-room, which was to be a model of its kind.
               This house must be secured before he went abroad, for it would take some time to fit it up according to his designs, the chief of which was to have a lift constructed from the ground floor to those above, so that he could pass from one set of apartments to another without the indignity and ridicule of being carried up and down stairs.
               In fact, William Morton Fitzgerald had a great many irons in the fire; but as it is not a very grateful task to record the proceedings of an utterly selfish and unscrupulous man, especially when they are attended with unvarying success. I will dismiss the entire subject by saying that, with his usual good fortune, he managed his hot irons so adroitly as to mould them to what form he pleased, and accomplish all his wishes, without once burning his fingers.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               CHANGE OF SCENE.
               THE events which I have hitherto related occurred in the month of November, and the scene now changes to a villa in the neighborhood of Brixton. The time was early in June of the following year, and a young lady, assisted by the housemaid, has just accomplished the equipment, in full evening costume, of four little girls, who are immediately handed into a fly at the door, where their mamma already awaits them.
               As they drive off, the young lady, who is evidently their governess, smiles, and kisses her hand to them, and hopes they will enjoy themselves; but as soon as they are fairly gone, she turns back into the house, and yawns with an air of weariness.
               "It must be quite a treat to you, Miss, to have an hour's rest," said the housemaid, "such an owdacious set of children I never came near."
               "All children are troublesome, Susan," replied the young lady, "but my rest is not come yet. I have all their clothes to put away."
               
               "I'll put them away, Miss. Don't you trouble about them," said the good-natured girl. "I have my evening out every other Sunday, you know, besides a whole day's holiday sometimes; and I'm sure you have had nothing but an odd half-hour now and again for the whole year that I've been in the house."
               "You are very kind, Susan; but it is my duty, and I must do it."
               "Leastways then I can help you, Miss," said Susan, following Miss Harley up stairs.
               "I am sorry to hear that you are going away, Susan," said Miss Harley. "I was quite surprised at it too; for Mrs. Neale was speaking so highly of you last week, that I thought she would never like to part with you."
               "Oh! it's me gave Missus warning, Miss."
               "That seems still more surprising," said the young lady. "Is it not to your interest to remain as long as possible in one situation?"
               "Yes, Miss, of course it is, if the situation is an out-and-out good one. But I've got an excellent character, and if I can get another place where there's more wages and less work, I should be a fool to stop. So, you see, Miss, I'm going away to better myself."
               The girl went down stairs, and Miss Harley sat at the open window of her bedroom, enjoying the unwonted feeling of repose and quiet. She liked that window,—though the room to which it belonged was only a back attic,—better than any in the house, for it commanded a view, between and over some other houses, of the Surrey hills, blue and indistinct in the distance. How she wished that the term of her temporary release from thraldom would suffice to take her to them, that she might explore their dark recesses, and breathe the fresh free air upon their summits! But her plagues would be back, in five or six hours at the utmost. Should she take the opportunity of going out for walk?—Where?—Along dusty roads, and past houses—houses—houses, as though the whole surface of the earth were let out on building leases? No. She would sit at her window, and watch the sunset, on the hills, and enjoy to the utmost the unaccustomed sense of repose.
               She placed her pillow at the back of an old rocking-chair that had been thrust into her room as lumber, and lulled herself, by a gentle movement, into a state of dreamy beatitude.
               The dolce far niente, however, soon palls upon a young and vigorous nature, accustomed moreover to habitual activity.
               Miss Harley began to think, and Susan's words came back on her mind suggestively.
               "Going away to better herself!" she repeated half aloud. "Not a bad idea, either. Why should not I go away to better myself?" she continued, starting upright in her chair, and withdrawing her dreamy glances from the hills. "Surely I also might have a chance of getting 'better wages and less work.' More work I could not do, for I have those four spoiled children to wash and dress—to teach them—wash and dress again, and take them out walking—teach them again, watch over them at meal times-wash and dress again to go into the drawing-room, then wash and undress, and then—sit down to mend or make their clothes! And after six blessed days of this mill-horse round of labor, there is no rest for me on Sunday. The washing and dressing goes on as usual, varied by the constant watchfulness they require to keep them out of mischief during service at church—then I have to teach them the catechism, collects, verses, and thirty-nine articles; (and O! how devoutly do I wish that Sidney Smith's dream were true, and that there really were thirty-nine muses, and only nine articles!) and not content with that, I must teach in the Sunday-school morning and night. On the whole, I think Sunday is the worst day out of the seven. And Mr. Neale preaches about the blessed day of rest, and Mrs. Neale is what she calls a professing Christian, and yet they will work a poor wretch of a governess to death in that way, and pay her only twenty pounds a year! Stop, though! I am not dead yet. And while I've got the strength and spirit left to do it, I'll follow Susan's example, and go away to better myself."
               At that moment she heard Susan moving about in the adjoining room.
               "Susan!" she said, opening her door, "can you bring me a newspaper?"
               "Yes, Miss, certainly. Which one would you like? Cook's got Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper down stairs, shall I fetch you that? It's a beautiful paper—so amusing! It's got every particular about all the murders in it."
               "I don't want an amusing paper, Susan," said Miss Harley, smiling at the housemaid's idea of the amusing. "I should prefer the Times. That part that has the advertisements in it."
               "Yes, Miss, I'll see if I can get it," replied Susan; "but master always keeps the papers in his study till the boy comes for them, just as if he was afraid we should any of us get a peep at them. We should not eat them if we did, I dare say."
               Susan flew down stairs, and presently returned with the Times advertisement sheet.
               "Here it is, Miss," cried she, in triumph; "just as I got down stairs the newsboy came for it, so I slipped this part under my apron, and gave him the other, and I told him this was mislaid, but I'd look it up and bring it around in an hour. Will that do, Miss?"
               "Yes, Susan, and I am greatly obliged to you," said Miss Harley.
               Now if this young lady had been a model governess, or had profited as she ought, by the preachings and teachings of her pious employers, she would have improved the present occasion by reading Susan a lecture upon the sinfulness of telling even a white fib. But Miss Harley, having profited without hesitation by the girl's kindness, would have considered it a piece of consummate impertinence to do anything of the kind.
               She sat down to examine the advertisements, but did not find much encouragement in the study. There were so many ladies advertising for situations—some professing to teach an almost impossible list of accomplishments, others with certificates of ability from colleges and professors, others offering their services in return for a comfortable home—that Marian Harley began to think it might be wiser to keep those ills she had, than fly to others that she knew not of.
               She turned over the paper with a sigh and a smile. With a sigh, at the apparent hopelessness of any prospect of "bettering herself;" with a smile, at her own folly, in having indulged a presentiment that she would find something of vital importance to herself among those advertisements.
               What a mass of wants and wishes were collected there! Houses to be let, horses to be sold. One tailor advising gentlemen not to run tailor's bills; and another frantically assuring the public that he is himself, and not "another gentleman of the same name."
               "Next of Kin Wanted," caught her eye. There is always something attractive in those announcements. The idea of property going about and seeking for an owner, is at once tempting and tantalizing, and suggests a sort of vague idea that we may ourselves have overlooked the existence of some aunt or uncle, who is now appealing to us, from the tomb, through the medium of a lawyer, and the Times.
               What must be the feelings of those who really find themselves wanted? What were Marian Harley's feelings when she read what follows?—
               "Next of Kin Wanted. If Miss Marian Harley, niece to Mrs. Martha Blake, of Upton Manor House near Tattleton, in the county of Somerset, Spinster, deceased, will apply to William M. Fitzgerald Esq. No. — Wimpole Street, Cavendish Square, London, she will hear of something greatly to her advantage."
               "Why, that's my aunt!" screamed Marian, springing up wildly.
               "Did you call, Miss? Oh! dear! dear! What's the matter?" cried Susan, running in from the next room.
               "It's my aunt! My aunt Martha Blake! She's dead—and there's all her property, the beautiful cedar trees and all, coming to me. Oh! Oh! Oh! It all seems so strange. I don't think it can be true! This will be bettering myself! I was going away to 'better myself!' Ha! Ha! Ha!"
               And she fell upon her bed with a wild hysterical laugh.
               Susan ran into her own room, and brought out a glass of water with a little sal volatile in it.
               "Drink this directly, Miss," she said, in a tone of authority, "and don't you go on like that, no more. Here's Master coming up, I do believe, to see what all the noise is about."
               
               "Is he?" cried Miss Harley, starting up, and looking quite collected again. "Don't let him see me like this, Susan. Shut the door—I'm all right now."
               Susan went to the door, looked out for an imaginary "Master," and observing, "He's altered his mind, I suppose—he's gone back again," brought the glass to Miss Harley, and begged her to drink the contents.
               "It is very foolish of me," said Marian, complying, while her teeth rattling against the glass showed how much her nerves had been shaken: "I am very silly; the joy was too much for me."
               "What was it, Miss, if I may make so bold as to ask?" demanded Susan.
               "Look here!" showing the advertisement, "this Mrs. Martha Blake was my aunt; my mother's only sister. I never saw her, but I know she never forgave my mother for marrying against her wish. She was twenty years older than mamma, and had brought her up, and wanted her to marry the clergyman. But papa was a sailor, and so she liked him better, and ran away with him. And Aunt Martha never forgave her, and never would see her again. And now, you see, she's dead, and she must have made a will, I should think, and left Upton Manor to me, or they would not advertise for the next of kin. And I am the next of kin, Susan! Oh! It is such a pretty place! I've got a picture of it—it has been in our family for hundreds dreds of years, and there are two beautiful cedar trees on the lawn"—
               The cedar trees seemed to have a strong tendency to cause hysterics, for Miss Harley's voice began to quaver again when she named them.
               "I wouldn't build my hopes too high, if I was you, Miss," said Susan, anxious to check this excessive, though very natural excitement. "The advertisement doesn't say anything about the house, and all that; and so, you know, it may only be a legacy, or something of that sort."
               "That's very true, Susan. Thank you for putting it in that light. I was half-beside myself with joy, to think of those ce—ce—cedar trees."
               "Well, Miss, and after all, you know, you can't tell that you won't have them till you've seen the lawyer, no more than you can tell that you will have them," said the prudent Susan, when she saw the tears filling Marian's eyes, as she realized the idea that those ancestral trees might never be hers after all;—"and now, don't you think you had better write a letter to that lawyer? It'll ease your mind a bit, and I'll post it when I take the newspaper back."
               "You are quite right, Susan. It is too late to call on him this evening, so I will write, and ask him what benefit I am likely to derive from Mrs. Blake's estate. I shall have the note ready by the time you have put on your bonnet and shawl."
               Marian Harley's note to our old acquaintance, William M. Fitzgerald, was simply a statement of her relationship to the late Mrs. Blake, and a request to be informed of the advantage she was likely to derive from that circumstance.
               When it was gone, she felt so restless and uneasy that she almost wished for the return of her little torments, that her mind night be forced away from the harassing speculations that beset it.
               They came in due time, and she had never found them so troublesome, so cross-grained, so difficult to manage. However, they were at last all got into bed, and then the governess was fain to lay her own throbbing head upon her pillow.
               When she opened her eyes the next morning, Marian's first impression was that she had been under the influence of a powerful dream; but the housemaid's assiduous attentions, and the evidence of her own memory, speedily convinced her that it was a delightful reality to the extent at least of having been advertised for, and that something greatly to her advantage was to be the result. The question was, whether a lawyer would consider a few hundred pounds as something greatly to anybody's advantage. "I should," thought Marian, "for it would make me independent of my employers. I could leave this horrid place where I am so over-worked and tormented, and I could afford to wait till I met with something much better. Or, I might take a school; or perhaps I may have the dear old house."
               And here she relapsed, into a day-dream, and committed all sorts of blunders with the children's lessons.
               They were all late at morning prayers, and Mrs. Neale rebuked the governess sharply for her want of punctuality. Miss Harley took the reprimand with the utmost apathy, in fact she scarcely seemed to hear it. Whereat, Mrs. Neale drew down the corners of her spiteful mouth in a manner that promised something pleasant for Miss Harley by-and-bye, and went to prayers in anything but a Christian-like frame of mind.
               It is much to be doubted whether the monotonous family prayers, the same that she had listened to every day for the last two years, conveyed the slightest meaning to Marian's mind on that occasion. When the droning tones of Mr. Neale's voice ceased, and Mrs. Neale's sharp voice began to give orders to the servants, she knew that the performance was over, and rose from her knees still listening in imagination to the sighing of the wind among the branches of those majestic cedars, which were growing there when her ancestors built Upton Manor House, in the reign of Elizabeth.
               Mrs. Neale, favored her with one of her most unamiable scowls, and looked about for something to find fault with.
               "Perhaps, Miss Harley," she began, in a tone of dignified satire—"perhaps you will condescend to come down from the clouds, where you appear to have been staying, all the morning, and bestow a little attention upon your earthly duties."
               
               "Oh yes, certainly!" replied Marian, with cheerful, alacrity. "What is, it?"
               "What is it, indeed!" repeated Mrs. Neale, with withering sarcasm—"only that the young ladies' pinafores are untied. That is all, Miss Harley."
               "Come here, young ladies, and have your pinafores tied," said Marian, with provoking nonchalance.
               "I can't think what's come to the creature!" muttered the mistress of the house, commencing the operation of making the tea, in such a state of indignation that she nearly upset the urn. "Such impertinence! I never!"
               Marian's imperturbable placidity continued during the whole of breakfast time, and the little blunders she committed were innumerable, while she was completely impervious to all Mrs. Neale's shafts of anger or ridicule.
               During the morning's lessons it was the same; but the children made no complaints, as she let them do just as they liked.
               At noon, which was their usual time for taking a walk, they were all ready to go out, when the postman brought a letter, addressed to Miss Harley, Honeywood Villa.
               It was a large, important looking letter, in an official blue envelope, sealed. with a large seal, and stamped with the initials W. M. F. It was from the lawyer, Mr. Fitzgerald, couched in most respectful terms, and requesting an immediate interview.
               Mrs. Neale being from home, it was impossible for Marian to ask her permission to go out, which she would have very probably denied. Miss Harley therefore took the matter into her own hands; and having consigned the children to Susan's guardianship till their mamma's return, she stepped into a cab, and drove rapidly to Wimpole Street.
               Unlike the usual habits of young women of her class, Susan had kept her own counsel respecting the advertisement; and she very much enjoyed the perplexity of her fellow-servants at this unheard-of proceeding on the part of the governess, and their various and extravagant conjectures respecting the object of her sudden journey.
               Marian in the meanwhile reached the place of her destination, and was ushered, by a grave looking elderly man-servant, out of livery, into the richly furnished dining-room. Everything in this large apartment bespoke wealth, governed by a correct and severe taste. All was handsome, costly, and substantial; nothing was superfluous or meretricious.
               Marian looked attentively around her, and strove to form an opinion of the man she was about to see, and on whose communications her future fate depended. She came to the conclusion that he must be an elderly, or at least a middle-aged man, and was framing imaginary speeches for him and herself, when the grave man-servant returned, and requested her to follow him into the next room.
               
               Very much to her surprise, she found herself in the presence of a remarkably handsome young man, who was seated at a library table covered with papers.
               The servant announced Miss Harley, placed a chair near the table, and withdrew.
               "Pray be seated Miss Harley," said Mr. Fitzgerald, gracefully waving his hand towards the chair; "and also I must beg you will excuse my apparent rudeness in not rising to receive a lady. I cannot help it. I am lame."
               "Oh! sir, pray don't mention it," said Marian, hastily; "but be so kind as to tell me if I am the person for whom you advertised?"
               "I have not the slightest doubt that you are," he replied, smiling, and showing a beautiful set of pearly teeth. "You tell me in this letter that your mother was the younger sister of Mrs. Martha Blake; that she married a certain James Harley, a captain in the East India Company's service; that you are the only offspring of that marriage; and consequently, I may add, you are the heiress of the deceased lady, Mrs. Martha Blake."
               "And shall I then have Upton Manor, and the—the—cedar trees?" exclaimed Marian, clasping her hands, while tears of joy gathered in her eyes, and her voice faltered on the last words.
               "Only prove satisfactorily that you are yourself, and not an impostor, and I will put you in immediate possession of the Manor of Upton-on-the Hill, and the—the—cedar trees," he replied, mimicking her, but not ill-naturedly. "I remember to have heard that there are two of the finest cedars in the county on the lawn at Upton."
               "Oh yes! my mother used to talk about them so! She was so fond of them! And I think she would not have died if she could have seen them, and been near them," said Marian, fairly giving way to her emotions.
               "Singular young woman," thought cynical William, "she thinks more of a couple of old trees than of the rich meadows, and the rents. Simple-minded, easily managed,—half a fool,—and rich. I think she'll do."
               What he meant by the latter part of his unspoken soliloquy, will be seen hereafter.
               "Now that you have indulged your very natural and beautiful feelings, dear young lady," he said aloud, with hypocritical sentimentality, "let us proceed to business. No doubt this sudden brightening of your prospects,—for I conclude," he continued, parenthetically, "that they are brightened?"
               "Of course they are!" cried Marian, giggling hysterically. "I am only a poor drudge of a governess to four horrid, spoilt children!"
               Mr. Fitzgerald touched a little gong that stood on the table at his elbow. The elderly servant instantly answered the summons, and at the single word "Wine," retreated for a few seconds, and then returning, placing decanters and glasses on the table.
               
               "Pour out a glass of sherry for Miss Harley," said the lawyer. "Excuse the liberty I take in selecting for you, Madam. I chose it as the most likely to steady your nerves. That will do, Saunders."
               The servant retreated at the hint; and Marian drank the wine, and felt less disposed to giggle and to cry.
               Mr. Fitzgerald led her on kindly step by step; examined the documents that she had brought with her; produced others which he had by him; and made out her claim so satisfactorily, that nothing remained but to go through a few technical forms, and to hand over to her the title-deeds of her ancestral property. This, he said, would probably be accomplished in a week or two.
               "And now," he said, when all was ended, "it seems a pity that the Lady of the Manor of Upton- on-the-Hill should go back to the drudgery of being governess to those four horrid children. You must let me be your banker, Miss Harley."
               "What do you mean sir?" demanded Marian, innocently.
               "I mean that though you are entitled to a good sum of money, you cannot touch it before these legal forms are gone through. Therefore I offer to lend you some for your present use. Will two hundred pounds suffice?"
               "You are very kind, Mr. Fitzgerald,—but suppose anything should happen that I should not get this property?"
               "Suppose nothing of the sort!" he answered laughing. "Give me your acknowledgment for whatever I advance, and even if you were run over and killed on your way home, I could still claim repayment from the estate. Say then,—will two hundred be enough for your immediate expenses?"
               "If you are quite sure that it will be safe," she began, with hesitation.
               "When did you ever hear of a lawyer offering to lend money unless he knew it to be safe?" he demanded, gayly.
               "Then a hundred—or fifty pounds, if you will have the kindness."
               He wrote out a cheque for the sum he had himself named, and handed it to her with the remark that she would just have time to get it cashed if she presented it at the bank at once.
               Then summoning his servant, he desired him to send for a fast Hansom for Miss Harley, to take the number, and to tell the driver to go quickly to Drummond's.
               Marian rose to depart, and timidly offered her hand to the friendly lawyer. He took it eagerly, and pressed it warmly between his own, while he pronounced an elaborate and fervent aspiration that she might be blessed with long life and health, to enjoy the fortune which he had been the happy means of securing for her.
               "A neat little speech that!" he said to himself, after she was gone. "I hope she will think of it, think she'll do!—I'm very sure she'll do."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               MONEY MAKES FRIENDS.
               WHEN Miss Harley returned to the house which had been her abode for two years, but which she had never called nor looked upon as her home, she was met by a perfect storm of angry invectives from Mrs. Neale.
               "Such unheard-of conduct!" exclaimed that lady, at length, sinking upon a chair, quite overcome with her own violence. "To go out for five hours without asking permission, and to leave me to take care of those tiresome children all that time! I never heard of such conduct, Miss Harley! I never heard of such conduct! I am quite overpowered with fatigue; you have made me quite ill, Miss Harley. I don't know when I shall get over it!"
               And she began to whimper over her own wrongs.
               "Then what must it have been for me, Mrs. Neale," said Marian, quietly; "does it not strike you that I must have been much more fatigued, when I have had those tiresome children to take care of every day, and all day?"
               "How dare you call my children tiresome?" cried their mother, starting up, furious with passion.
               "I merely repeated your own words. But I quite agree with you, that they are very tiresome children."
               "I really am at a loss to understand you, Miss Harley," said Mrs. Neale, her anger becoming absorbed in her amazement at the quiet self-possession of the poor dependent governess.
               "It means simply this," responded Marian, unruffled as ever; "that as I am going to leave you, Mrs. Neale, I can afford, for once, to speak my mind freely to you about your children, to whom you do more injury during the few hours they are with you, than any governess can rectify during the remainder of the twenty-four."
               "You are going away!" repeated Mrs. Neale, not noticing the latter part of Marian's speech; "then I suppose you have been about another place this morning!"
               "Yes," replied Marian, laughing, "that was precisely the business that took me out."
               "Don't flatter yourself that I'll give you a character, Miss Harley!" cried the other lady, "for I shall do no such a thing! After such conduct, you can't expect it. So you needn't send anybody to me."
               "It is not of the slightest consequence, my dear Madam," replied the imperturbable Marian, "for I have no intention of sending any one to you, as I do not require a reference."
               
               "Then you're going to get married!" cried Mrs. Neale, her features actually swelling with spitefulness. "I see how it is—you're going to get married! you've picked up some fellow or other."
               "Pardon me, Mrs. Neale," interrupted Marian, with great dignity, "I cannot permit any one to use such expressions to me."
               "You—can't—permit!" echoed Mrs. Neale, aghast at her assurance.
               "No, decidedly I cannot; and what is more, I will not permit it."
               Mrs. Neale sank back in her seat, unable, for the moment, to utter a syllable.
               "Now, my dear Madam," said Marian, taking advantage of the temporary silence to address the speechless little woman, "would it not be far more rational to ask me quietly where I have been, and what I intend to do, instead of jumping to all sorts of unfounded conclusions, and imagining all sorts of unlikely answers to imaginary questions? As I see that you are quite overcome by the excitement into which you have so foolishly worked yourself, I will tell you all, without being asked. I am neither going into another situation, nor going to be married; but I am going to take possession of an estate that has belonged to my family for three hundred years. The last possessor was an elder sister of my mother's. She died about a year ago. I saw an advertisement for her next of kin. I went to the lawyer this morning, and I return to your house, no longer the poor governess, but the Lady of the Manor of Upton-on-the-Hill, at your service, Ma'am."
               She made a low courtesy as she uttered the last words, and was a good deal surprised, and not a little amused, to find herself, when she rose, clasped in Mrs. Neale's most affectionate embraces. At any other time Marian Harley would have felt the utmost contempt for such a bare-faced act of Mammon worship; but she was now too brimful of happiness to be capable of entertaining a resentful feeling; so she only laughed, and received the lady's demonstrations civilly, though without any strong manifestations of delight or cordiality.
               Mrs. Neale then ran off to tell her husband, who immediately seized upon Marian, and improved the occasion by preaching to her an extempore sermon of an hour's duration.
               Patiently and respectfully Marian heard him to the end.
               "I am greatly indebted to you, Mr. Neale," she then said, very demurely, "for the excellent advice with which you have favored me. My answer to it is four-fold. Firstly,—I am not yet in actual possession of this property, and we must not forget the proverb, there's many a slip, 'tween the cup and the lip.' Secondly,—there are cottagers on the land, who will naturally claim my first attention. Thirdly,—I do not expect to have more than a moderate income. And fourthly,—if it proves to be a great deal more, I'll build a model lodging-house before I'll build a church or chapel, because I think that people should be housed a little better than pigs, before you can expect to preach them into being Christians. And now, my dear Sir, I'll add a fifthly,—as there's luck in odd numbers,—and say, that I want to make everybody about me as happy as I am myself, so I'll take the children out and give them some presents, though their mamma says they are very tiresome children, and I fully agree with her."
               Without waiting for an answer, which might entail a continuation of the sermon, Miss Harley left the room briskly, and proceeded to carry out her good-natured project.
               "My dear," said Mr. Neale, in a tone of deep solemnity, as soon as the door closed behind her, "I tremble to think that the spiritual well-being of our beloved little ones should have so long been under the influence of a person of that young woman's heterodox and latitudinarian ideas. I trrr-emble to think of it!"
               "Oh, my dear! I'm so sorry to hear you say that," replied his worldly-wise little wife, "for I was going to offer to let Emma go with her, by way of company, you know. It would only be prudent, my dear. One cannot tell what may happen. A young person like that, coming suddenly into property, is sure to make her will very soon, just for the importance it gives her, and who can she leave her money to? She has no relations I understand, and if she has a dear child with her, what is more likely than that she would remember her—if it was only a hundred pounds, or so, it would always be something, wouldn't it?"
               "My love, you are always right," said the reverend gentleman, saluting his better half; "and Emma's principles, as you say, are too well-founded to be shaken by the flippancy and frivolity of such a giddy-pated young person as this Miss Harley. Act according to your own discretion, my best and dearest. It was for the younger children that my fears were aroused. Emma is older, and is too like her mother for there to be any danger of her principles being undermined."
               With which gallant speech he left his wife free to do her little bit of 
                     avaracious
                     avaricious
                   wire-pulling.
               On that day 
                     Marion
                     Marian
                  , the heiress, was of course invited to dine at the table of her ci-devant employers, where Marian, the governess, had never been allowed to sit.
               At first she felt disposed to decline the honor; but the irrepressible good humor which seemed flowing through her veins instead of blood, would not suffer her even to assert her dignity. She laughed and accepted.
               After dinner Mrs. Neale proceeded to put her little project for Emma's advancement into execution, by proposing, quite as a favor to Miss Harley, that that young lady, just ten years old, should accompany her to Upton Manor, because she would feel so lonely after being accustomed to so much life and bustle.
               
                  
                     Marion
                     Marian
                   knew too thoroughly the character of the woman she had to deal with, to feel a moment's doubt as to her object in making this proposition; and she put a decisive veto upon it immediately.
               "I really don't know how to thank you sufficiently for all the kindness that you have shown me this afternoon, my dear Mrs. Neale," she began; "especially for this crowning mark of confidence, in offering to place your favorite child under my care. But just imagine yourself for a moment in my place. Suppose that for two mortal years you had been chained like a galley-slave to four children, whom you have yourself," she added with an insinuating smile, "discovered this afternoon, to be very tiresome; don't you think you would like to go somewhere, where you would neither see nor hear any children for a month or two? Besides, joking apart, I shall have so very much to do, and so much business to attend to, that I cannot possibly take advantage of your kind offer for some time to come."
               There was no answering this decision, and Mrs. Neale was not at all sorry when, on the following morning, "that hateful, upstart, conceited, satirical minx," as she termed Miss Harley, took her departure.
               Marian went first to Mr. Fitzgerald, to ask his advice respecting her present and future movements.
               As her presence would be required in town for a week or two, pending some legal proceedings, he recommended her to board for that period with a friend of his, a widow lady of the highest respectability, under whose auspices and chaperonage she might, with advantage, indulge in the gayeties of society, and visit places of public amusement. Marian expressed her satisfaction at the proposed arrangement, and intimated her wish to call on this lady without delay.
               "If you will favor me with your company for ten minutes longer," he replied, striking the gong, "I shall have the pleasure of introducing her to you. I foresaw what you would require, and have already been in communication with her. Present my compliments to Mrs. Mitchell," he said to the servant who answered the summons, "and ask her to favor me with her company for a few minutes. Mrs. Mitchell lives only half a dozen doors off, Miss Harley, so you will not have very for to come for legal advice, or for cheques, till you are entitled to draw your own. I fear I was not quite disinterested in my anxiety to secure you as an inmate of her house."
               He uttered the last sentence in a low and tender tone, and his voice, so sweet and mellow, trembled and vibrated with an expression of such deep pathos, that Marian felt her heart beat with unwonted emotion. She wished to speak—to break through the silence that was fast becoming painfully constrained; but she could not frame a sentence, nor think for the moment of a subject for conversation. She looked up timidly, and saw that Mr. Fitzgerald was resting his head upon his hand, with his eyes cast down mournfully. He seemed to be aware that she had looked at him, for he suddenly raised his head, saying, with a very apparent effort at cheerfulness, "You will find Mrs. Mitchell a most agreeable person, Miss Harley. In manners and experience she is a thorough woman of the world, though her heart is as fresh as that of a school-girl. It is rare indeed to meet with such a combination. Although so much your senior in point of age, I flatter myself that she will prove to you a delightful companion, and I trust she may induce you to remain with her for some time. I assure you I consider myself most fortunate in having secured her as your chaperone. I have arranged all the terms with her, (subject, of course, to your approval,) and you are to have command of the whole house, exactly as if it were your own, and she were your hired companion."
               "Oh, sir," cried Marian, almost alarmed at such a prospect, "that is much more than I should like to bargain for. I am not made so purse-proud by my sudden good fortune, that I should at once throw off all my long acquired habits of submission to the will of others, and want to be mistress over a lady who is kind enough to receive me into her house. I must confess, however, that I shall feel very great pleasure in entering into possession of my own house—of dear old Upton Manor, where my mother passed her childhood."
               "And of sitting, under the shade of the cedars?" he suggested, with a sly smile.
               "You may well laugh at me, Mr. Fitzgerald," responded Marian, blushing. "I must have appeared very silly, I know. But my mother used to talk so much about those trees—they were so associated in my mind, even from my infancy, with the house, that they really were the first things that I thought of. I have not even inquired whether the house is habitable or furnished."
               "It is furnished in a comfortable, old-fashioned style, exactly as your aunt left it a year ago. Since that time it has been in the care of an old and trustworthy servant, who held the post of house-keeper to Mrs. Blake for a great many years, nearly thirty, I believe."
               "That must be old Mrs. Farncombe!" exclaimed Marian, greatly delighted; "it will be like meeting a relation almost!"
               A slight contortion, almost like a spasm of pain, passed over William Fitzgerald's handsome brow; but it instantly cleared again, as Mrs. Colonel Mitchell was announced, and a spruce little lady, dressed in a becoming morning costume, sailed lightly into the room.
               "How are you, my dear Mr. Fitzgerald?" said the little sylph, enthusiastically shaking his hand in both her tiny gloved ones. "But I need not ask you,—for you are always well. And is this Miss Harley?" sailing towards Marian, who stared with amazement to see this little butterfly, instead of the grave elderly lady whose image the lawyer's words had conjured up. "Do let me shake hands with you, you dear, fortunate girl! And am I to have the extreme pleasure of acting as duenna to Miss Harley?" continued the volatile lady. "Oh! do make haste, and say yes, or I shall be so disappointed!"
               "I am fully prepared to say yes, if you will allow me an opportunity of doing so," said the lawyer, gravely; "and respecting the terms, I have already told Miss Harley that I have made every arrangement with you, and that you will come to me for settlement. And to yourself, Miss Harley, I need hardly add, that as soon as you require more money, you have only to send to me for what amount you think proper. Unless," he added, with a slight hesitation of manner—"unless you will do me the favor, and confer on me the, honor—the happiness of a personal visit."
               "A great deal of difficulty there will be in that!" exclaimed Mrs. Mitchell; "why, we shall be popping in every day—you'll have to forbid us the house!"
               "Indeed, Mr. Fitzgerald," said Marian, as she shook hands with him, "I shall be very happy to call sometimes, if not intruding on your time; besides, I shall have to come on business."
               "Yes—that's it; you'll have to come on business," he repeated, with mingled sorrow and bitterness. "Good morning."
               He scarcely spoke to Mrs. Mitchell, who retreated treated, chattering all the time, and followed by Marian, sorely puzzled, and rendered rather uncomfortable by the lawyer's singular behavior.
               The cab, with Miss Harley's luggage, stood at the door. It was quickly transferred to Mrs. Mitchell's, only a few doors off; and that lady herself conducted Marian to the handsomest bedchamber in the establishment.
               "And now, my dear Miss Harley," said the mistress of the house, suddenly changing her lively, rattling tanner for one of perfect gravity, "we must talk matters over seriously. Fitzgerald has given me a hint of your affairs, nothing minute, you understand; no unnecessary tittle-tattle, or gossip. He told me you had suddenly come into a handsome fortune; but that you were so inexperienced, and had lived in such retirement from the world, that you had probably formed no ideas upon the subject of dress and fashion, and that you might possibly like to profit by my experience."
               "I shall be very grateful for your advice," said Marian, frankly, "for Mr. Fitzgerald is quite correct in saying that I know nothing about it. Did he not tell you that I have been only a poor governess?"
               "Oh, my dear! He has too much delicacy to even hint at such a thing."
               "I don't see that there would have been any indelicacy in telling you so," said Marian; "there is no more disgrace in having been a governess than there is merit in inheriting a fortune. I should never be ashamed of anybody knowing what I have been."
               "You are a girl after my own heart!" exclaimed Mrs. Mitchell, with a slight return of the enthusiasm; "that is just what I should do under similar circumstances. And now, my dear, let me see the extent of your wardrobe."
               "I think it will be hardly worth your while to examine the rest, when I tell you that I am now wearing the best dress that I possess," said Marian.
               "Then that decides me at once," said Mrs. Mitchell; "I know now what ground I stand upon. We will go first to an outfitter's, and order two or three dozen of everything."
               "No," interposed Marian, decisively, "I never have bought ready-made linen, and I never will."
               "But, my dear girl! why not? The work is excellent."
               "That may be. But how are the poor work-women paid? The greater part of the profits goes into the pockets of the shopkeeper. It will only be waiting a little longer for them, and I am really in no hurry."
               "Well, I must say I think you are very foolish, my dear. What can these people be to you? Or why should you care whether they get paid a little more or less for their work?"
               "It is not so very long ago since I was hard worked myself, and I have not yet ceased to sympathize with those who are still more oppressed pressed," said Marian, gravely, "so that point is settled, if you please."
               "Very well, my dear; it must be as you wish," said Mrs. Mitchell, giving way at once when she saw that Marian was quite determined. "We will have lunch first, and then do all the shopping we can till dinner-time."
               While they were at lunch, a message arrived from Mr. Fitzgerald.
               "Master's compliments, and his brougham is at the door, in case the ladies would like a drive."
               "Now is not that kind and polite? He is so thoughtful!" exclaimed the little widow, "and he is generally so lively and agreeable too. But what ailed him to-day, I cannot imagine. One would almost fancy he had fallen in love."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               A DIPLOMATIC DINNER.
               MARIAN HARLEY was not one of those surprising beauties who would have attracted every eye, even in the costume of a beggar. In her formal simple dress, and with the subdued manner entailed by her dependent position, none but a close observer would have remarked the symmetrical proportions of her figure, or the elements of beauty that lurked in her face.
               But when, after several days of assiduous shopping, interrupted by long interviews with dressmakers and milliners, she came forth, full-fledged, gorgeous in silk attire, with sweeping robes and coquettish bonnets, French boots, and irreproachable gloves, and all those little et ceteras which go to the composition of a well-dressed woman, even Mrs. Colonel Mitchell, who had watched the gradual progress of the transformation, was lost in astonishment. The greatest change, however, was the internal well-spring of happiness that irradiated her face, gave elasticity to her step, made her laugh, a carol of joy, and, better than all, rendered her heart a sanctuary for gratitude and benevolence.
               Marian was in fact so supremely happy, that the day did not seem long enough for her to dispense as much happiness as possible all around her. She was not forgetful of her duties, in the meantime; and was very desirous to go to her little estate and look after the well-being of her poor tenants. But as she was compelled to remain for awhile in London, every instinct of her nature prompted her to enjoy herself. So she went with Mrs. Mitchell to theatres and concerts, had a few friends at home once or twice; and then came a serious affair,—a dinner party, with a little carpet-dance in the evening, at Mr. Fitzgerald's.
               When she entered Mr. Fitzgerald's elegant drawing-room, Marian found just nine guests assembled, making, with herself, Mrs. Mitchell, and the master of the house, exactly the favorite number, twelve.
               Mr. Fitzgerald was there, smiling, courteous, talkative and delightful; and Marian was wondering in her own mind how he would get down stairs into the dining-room, and thinking how much better it would have been for him to have been first found by his visitors at the head of his own table, when dinner was announced, and the subject of her speculations, after gayly apologizing to the lady who seemed to claim priority over all the others, for not offering her his arm, appointed his substitute, and paired off all the others, remaining alone in the drawing-room.
               "Will not Mr. Fitzgerald dine with us?" asked Marian, rather timidly, of her cavalier.
               "Oh yes!" he replied, "we shall find him in the dining-room. He goes up and down by means of a lift, which spares him the annoyance and indignity of being carried."
               "Poor man!" sighed Marian, "what a terrible thing it must be, to be so lame. He has been so for a long time, has he not? At least so Mrs. Mitchell tells me."
               "All his life, I understand. Yes—I told you so, There he is."
               And there, when they entered, seated at the head of his splendidly appointed dinner-table, was the bland and gracious Mr. William Morton Fitzgerald.
               If William possessed a genius for anything besides taking care of his own interests, it was for giving dinners. He selected his guests with the same delicate tact and appreciation that dictated his choice of dishes and of wines.
               They all harmonized; and after the first natural feeling of restraint wore off, Marian felt that she had never been in more delightful society. She was placed near the host, who exerted himself to keep up the flow of conversation, and frequently addressed himself to her. She was flattered by his attentions; she was amused by his remarks; but as the dinner progressed, she felt an 
                     unacount-
                     unaccountable
                   able longing growing upon her to, see her own pretty home at Upton Manor.
               When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room they were almost immediately followed by the gentlemen. About thirty more visitors had already assembled, many of whom were already known to Marian as friends of Mrs. Mitchell's, and while she was still occupied in receiving and returning their salutations, she became suddenly aware of the approach of Mr. Fitzgerald, propelling himself in his beautifully constructed chair, which he moved easily by means of a contrivance on the wheels.
               "Don't be alarmed, Miss Harley," he said, smiling, "I am not going to ask you to dance. I must leave that pleasure to more fortunate men. But I may, I trust, ask you, without much risk of a refusal, to spend some of your intervals of rest in the chair by my side. Will you do so?"
               "Oh! Certainly, Mr. Fitzgerald," said Marian, quite pained by the tone of humble entreaty in which he uttered the last words, "I will go there at once."
               "Not this moment," he replied, in a low sweet voice. He turned and retreated to his habitual place, beside a table covered with books and elegant trifles. As he did so, a dark scowl passed over his handsome face, and he muttered, "Little fool! As if I want to be paraded by her, for the amusement of every jackanapes in the room!"
               Not a word nor a glance, however, escaped the keen senses of the watchful little widow. William Fitzgerald might be playing a deep game—but she was playing a deeper. Mrs. Mitchell was not a widow for nothing.
               In a short time Marian seated herself in the easy-chair, which was always placed in readiness for such of the guests as desired to enjoy a conversation with the host.
               As may well be imagined, it was seldom vacant, and on the present occasion a baronet rose to give place to the young heiress.
               "I have not had an opportunity of speaking a word to you in private all the evening, until the present moment, Miss Harley," said William, though I have been desirous of doing so, in order to tell you that to-morrow, by twelve o'clock, I shall be in a position to surrender into your own hands the guardianship of your property."
               "And shall I be able to leave London then?" demanded Marian, eagerly.
               "How anxious you are to leave London! Can we not do anything to render it endurable to you?"
               "Endurable! I should think, indeed, that it was endurable!" returned Marian, with her merry laugh. "I enjoy myself here immensely. But still—perhaps you may think me very childish,—but I do wish very much to see my own house."
               "And the cedar trees! Really, Miss Harley, if you had a lover, he would have good cause to be jealous of those cedar trees. I could find in my heart to send down an emissary to set fire to them."
               "I did not think you could be so unkind as to tease me so unmercifully about them," said Marian almost pouting. "If you could love anything like that yourself, you would understand my feelings and sympathize with them."
               "What!" he exclaimed, so fiercely that she turned pale beneath his angry glance. "Do you mean to insinuate that, because I am a cripple, I have not the feelings and affections of a man?"
               "Oh! no, no, no!" she replied, while the tears started to her eyes. "I could not say such a thing. I meant only that lawyers are always too wise to waste their affections upon inanimate objects. If you had been a painter, or a poet, it would have been quite different."
               "Your excuses are lame, Miss Harley," he said, laughing bitterly, "and in that respect are all the better suited to their object. The analogy does not hold good throughout, for I at least am true."
               He turned and addressed a lady who had approached the table, and Marian seized the opportunity of stealing away, feeling very uncomfortable and very guilty.
               "What is amiss, my dear?" whispered Mrs. Mitchell, gliding up to her, where an intervening group shut them from Mr. Fitzgerald's view. "I saw that there was something wrong between you and the Grand Bashaw, but I refrained from coming to your assistance because any interference would probably have only made matters worse. And when he is put out, he lets everybody feel it."
               
               "It was a mere trifle,—a heedless expression of mine, which he chose to construe into a reflection on his lameness. As if any one with an atom of tact or delicacy could allude in any way to such a subject!"
               "Ah! poor fellow!" sighed the widow, "it's a great pity that he is so sensitive. Yet he will make an excellent husband, I have no doubt."
               "Husband!" repeated Marian, her eyes wide open with astonishment. "My dear Mrs. Mitchell, what can make you say that? You cannot seriously believe that any woman would like to marry him!"
               "Not any woman, certainly. She must be possessed of a very superior intellect, as well as a very tender heart."
               "Yes, he might be accepted from compassion," said Marian, thoughtfully; "that is, if he ever ventured to make an offer. But I think he is much more likely to be taken for the sake of his money."
               "As an encumbrance, eh?" suggested the widow, giving an odd sidelong glance out of her bright black eyes.
               "No—I would not say such a cruel thing for the world."
               "And yet it is quite possible that some one might do it."
               "If some one does, I hope she'll have the grace to hide it from him," said Marian, "and the prudence too; for his wife would not lead a very happy life, if he suspected she had married him for anything except his own merits."
               "You are right," replied Mrs. Mitchell, nodding her head, confidentially; "he will require a great deal of managing."
               And she looked very much as though she mentally promised him what he required.
               Some one now began to play on the piano, and inspired by the enlivening tones, the company made arrangements for a dance.
               "I saw you talking to her," he said, in a low tone, "though you fancied you were hidden from my view."
               "Oh dear, no! I never supposed that you did not see us, because I know you have the faculty of seeing everything, and of knowing what everybody in the room is saying and doing," said the lady, with a little giggle of admiring amazement. "I did it to humor her, poor girl, because I saw that you had frightened her, and she would speak out more freely if she thought she was out of your sight."
               "Well—and what did she say?"
               "Oh! a series of nothings," replied Mrs. Mitchell, raising her shoulders slightly—"girl's chatter, you know. She thinks this—and she doesn't think the other."
               "And what is the result in your mind? What do you think?"
               "The result, to my mind, lies in a nutshell. This girl's weak point consists in her inability to say 'No,'—a foible which is strongly (or perhaps I should say weakly) seconded by a nervous dread of giving pain to any one. It won't do, as you often told me—it won't do to tell the people of their failings to their very noses; so of course, acting on your wise counsels, I tell the silly girl that all this folly and weakness is benevolence, and regard for the feelings of others—true politeness, and so on, But that is her weak point, next to her vanity. And that passes everything I ever met with. The amount she has spent on dress during this last week—There—it's nonsense to say it exceeds all I ever spent during my whole life, because I really am so very economical, and even when I had ample means, I never spent more than was absolutely necessary. But Miss Harley's wardrobe"—
               "But, my dear Madam," interrupted William, "she has been by no means extravagant in her demands for money."
               "Very possibly, my dear Sir! But can she not obtain credit to any amount? I only hope and trust that her property may be considerable, or she will quickly reduce herself to beggary. Though there is always the prospect of a wealthy marriage for her; which perhaps she was thinking of when she said"—
               Mrs. Mitchell suddenly checked herself; but Mr. Fitzgerald eagerly inquired, "What did she say?"
               "At some future time, my good friend, I may tell you," said the widow, "but not now. What I have to say to you now is the result of my conversation with Miss Harley. Her weak point, as I said before, is her dread of giving pain. You may work upon her sympathies to any extent."
               "Humph!" responded Mr. Fitzgerald, looking very grim. "What! excite her compassion for my infirmity—make her pity me?"
               "Not with those ferocious looks, my dear friend, or you will frighten her again. No—speak of your lameness in a subdued, patient manner."
               At this moment Marian came towards them, and the widow, smiling to her, while she sighed to Mr. Fitzgerald, rose and went towards the piano.
               "I knew you would come. I knew I need not send to remind you of your promise," he said taking Marian's hand for a moment, and pressing it tenderly, while a fascinating smile overspread his countenance; "yours is not a nature to bear malice, especially against one who has so much cause as I have to claim indulgence for my hateful outbursts of suspicion and ill-temper. Picture to yourself what I must sometimes endure, even in a scene like this, and delighted as I am to witness the enjoyment of others. But to be tied here to this chair by a hopeless infirmity,—to feel within me the bounding pulse of health and youth, and not to be able to join in any of the amusements that I am so pleased to offer to others—these are the things that I feel. Wealth, you may say, compensates for much that is amiss; but for what purpose should I accumulate wealth? For me the sweet delights of married life must be a dead letter, unless I can meet with some woman, superior to the little prejudices of her sex—some woman of noble heart and exalted intellect, whose refined soul will enable her to read and appreciate my soul and mind, instead of estimating me, as a foolish worldling would do, by the exterior advantages of the body. I think I have met with such a woman, Miss Harley. Until very lately I despaired of doing so; but there hast come across my path"—
               Marian had been gradually getting very uncomfortable under the flow of Mr. Fitzgerald's eloquence. She had had no experience in love-making, but women instinctively know what is coming when a man gets into a rigmarole speech of the above description, and she longed for an excuse for making her escape.
               When a blundering coxcomb came up and interrupted Mr. Fitzgerald's speech by asking her to join in the polka, she thought him an angel of light come to her deliverance, and hastily apologizing to her host for her abrupt departure, started off with her bewhiskered partner. She danced with him till he was compelled to give in; and when she returned home, shortly after, she cried herself to sleep, she knew not wherefore.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               MARIAN'S JOURNEY TO TATTLETON.
               MARIAN awoke the morning after Mr. Fitzgerald's dinner party, less happy and satisfied than she had felt since she knew she was a lady of fortune; but with this feeling of discomfort came an increased desire to go to Upton Manor.
               She made every preparation for her departure, and then set off to undergo what she dreaded would prove the painful ordeal of her final interview with the lawyer.
               To her great satisfaction, however, she found him calm, self-possessed, and business-like; and quite free from that nervous, excitable manner, which had distressed her so much on the previous evening. As the conference progressed, her spirits rose; and she took her departure quite gayly, after confiding her title-deeds; &c., to the care of her legal friend, and complacently receiving his elaborate and complimentary adieu.
               "I am so delighted to see you looking yourself again, my dear," said Mrs. Mitchell, as Maria reentered that lady's drawing-room; "you looked so terribly woe-begone this morning, that it made me quite wretched to see you. I could almost imagine that you had just received an offer of marriage, you have such a radiant air. Now, do tell me,—you know what an interest I take in, all that concerns you,—has Mr. Fitzgerald proposed?"
               "How can you talk so about that poor man?" said Marian, quite pained by what she supposed to be a heartless jest; "I cannot laugh at his dreadful misfortune."
               "Laugh!" repeated the widow, "I assure you I am in serious earnest. It is easy to see that he is in love with you, so why should he not make you an offer?"
               "I cannot bring myself to believe you are right," said Marian, "and yet I am very glad that I have seen him for the last time. To confess the truth, there was something in his manner yesterday that made me very uncomfortable, and aroused a suspicion that it might be as you say. But this morning his behaviour is perfectly composed and collected, so I see that I was mistaken, and I shall go away quite happy."
               "You are an incomprehensible girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Mitchell; "why on earth should it give you pain to see that he is in love with you?"
               "Why—of course it would be much more distressing to refuse him, than to refuse any other man," said Marian, impatiently; "surely you can understand that! He would think it was on account of his lameness."
               "But why should you refuse him?"
               "Pray don't say any more about it, Mrs. Mitchell. The subject is unpleasant to me, and very indelicate towards Mr. Fitzgerald. The reason why you see me so much more cheerful than I was this morning, is that my mind is now relieved from all anxiety about it. So there let the subject drop."
               She had scarcely spoken the last words when the page brought in a letter, which Marian opened, mechanically, and began to read.
               In a moment she uttered a cry, flung the letter from her, and burst into tears.
               "Oh! How cruel! How dreadfully cruel of him!" she exclaimed, passionately. "Why should he inflict this pain upon me and himself? He might have spared us both. Could he not see it was of no use?"
               "What is it, dear?" cried the widow, snatching up the letter, which she did not hesitate to read. "Why, this is an offer of marriage from Mr. Fitzgerald! Surely you will not refuse him!—He's rolling in riches!"
               "I don't care for that," sobbed Marian. "I don't love him, and I can't marry him; and it is dreadfully unkind of him to ask me, when he must know I cannot accept him. Oh! how shall I tell him? I cannot bear to inflict pain, especially on a person who must feel it so acutely!"
               
               "Pray, my dear, be advised by me," said Mrs. Mitchell, soothingly; "think well about it, before you decide. Consider all the advantages of such a match."
               "I do not require one moment's consideration, Mrs. Mitchell. The only point on which I have the slightest necessity to deliberate, is how to word my refusal in the most conciliatory terms."
               "At least defer it till you are in the quiet of the country. Write a polite, formal note now, and tell him he shall have his answer in a week. That pledges you to nothing, you know."
               "I should feel that it pledged me to accept him, that's all," replied Marian; "the only honest and ingenuous course is to tell him the truth at once. The difficulty would be as great, or greater, if I deferred it for a week."
               "I am confident you will regret this precipitation," said Mrs. Mitchell; "when you know more of the world, you will see what an excellent chance you have thrown away."
               "I do not love him," said Marian, in a tone of expostulation; "it would be very wrong to marry any one without love."
               "Oh! what sentimental nonsense!" cried the widow. "Excuse my plain speaking, my dear Miss Harley; but it is really lamentable to see you sacrificing the solid blessings of life to the romantic dreams of childhood."
               "I possess enough of the solid blessings, as you all them, without sacrificing my happiness to gain more. My mind is quite made up. I shall write this painful letter at once, so that I may have nothing to spoil to-morrow's enjoyment."
               Marian intended to make her letter very brief, but she found it, nevertheless, extremely difficult to write; and after many attempts, it was quite late in the evening before she produced one that entirely suited her idea of what such an epistle ought to be.
               The train by which Marian intended proceeding to Tattleton left the London terminus at seven o'clock in the morning. She therefore bade adieu to her hostess over night, so as not to disturb her slumbers unnecessarily and it was with renewed cheerfulness that she found herself seated in the railway carriage, and just starting on her journey. She quietly surveyed her fellow-passengers, and wondered whether any of them were going to Tattleton.
               There was an old gentleman who appeared savage at having had his rest broken at an unreasonable hour, and was striving to finish his nap under difficulties on the journey. There was a dissipated looking young man, who apparently had had no sleep at all during the night, and was now taking it quite comfortably in his corner. And seated opposite to her was a short, stout gentleman, of about fifty, with slightly gray hair, a sharp nose, sharper eyes, a comical, mobile mouth, and a bronzed complexion, that looked as though he had resided for some time in a very warm climate.
               
               His keen eyes "took stock" of Marian while she was furtively surveying the other two; and the result of his observations was, that as soon as her shy glance was directed towards himself, he began to talk to her. He liked her appearance, and experience had taught him that if people begin talking as the train starts, they have a good chance of getting along very sociably; whereas, if they pass over the first hour in silence there is every possibility of their reaching the end of a long journey without uttering a syllable.
               "Would you like the window up, Ma'am?" he demanded, officiously handling the strap.
               "Oh, no, thank you—not on any account," she replied hastily; and then added, with a mental resolution to change carriages at the next station if he took her at her word, "that is, unless you are afraid of taking cold."
               "I hope that my appearance does not convey the impression of my being an invalid," said the sunburnt stranger. "I assure you, I rather pride myself on being the reverse,"
               "I could not imagine any other reason for wishing to have the window shut," said Marian.
               "My dear lady, you entirely misunderstood me. I prefer above all things, an abundance of fresh air. As an inhabitant for many years of a tropical climate, I have learnt to enjoy it as the greatest luxury. As a medical man, I know that it is the prime essential for health. But if a lady expresses a wish, all that I can do is to obey."
               "Yet I think, if I had preferred partial suffocation to this delicious morning air, you would have been wise enough to escape from the carriage on the first opportunity."
               "I might have sought safety in flight, certainly; or I might have taken the nobler part of remaining, to combat the giant Ignorance. In the case of a lady, possessing the very remarkable reasoning powers indicated by your phrenological development, I should decidedly have taken the latter course."
               "Can you also detect through my bonnet a remarkable development of vanity?" demanded Marian, laughing. "You must at least suspect its existence, or you would not offer up so much incense to the hidden deity."
               "Nay, I assure you there was not the remotest suspicion of flattery in my observation. If you are not sufficiently versed in phrenology, to know that I am quite correct, I appeal to your internal consciousness for corroboration. You do not feel like a fool, do you?"
               "Not quite," replied she, dryly, "whatever others may imagine me to be."
               A low laugh acknowledged that he was vanquished. But like a skilful general, he only gave way at one point, to renew his attack at another. He was naturally an inquisitive man, and he felt curious to know where this young lady was travelling, all by herself.
               As the whole line was well known to him, he first began to talk of the various scenes of interest through which it passed; but she was evidently wholly unacquainted with them. She must therefore be on her way, for the first time, to some particular station, and his object now was to find it out. He named one after another in a cursory way, but without exciting a gleam of interest on her quiet, happy face, until he came to Tattleton.
               "We shall arrive there shortly after eleven, I think," said Marian.
               "Precisely at eleven, according to Bradshaw, madam," replied the stranger, satisfied that he had at last discovered the place of her destination, "but we must allow them a few minutes grace. Tattleton is a delightful town. I think it the prettiest in the county; for though it cannot boast of a cathedral, it has two remarkably fine Gothic churches, and the country around is charming. But perhaps you know it well?"
               "No," she replied, "I have never been there. Is it a lively town?"
               "Pretty well,—pretty well,—for a country place, and not near the sea. During the assizes, for instance, and the races, and when the militia are called out, it is full of bustle and activity. And even at other times, the good folks contrive to keep themselves alive. You must know it is a tremendous place for gossip, and the population is quite large enough to supply abundance of material, without being so numerous as to render any considerable section philosophically indifferent respecting specting what Mrs. Smith says about Mrs. Brown, and Mrs. Grundy about everybody."
               "From your account, it seems to be a desirable place of residence," said Marian, ironically; "a sort of compound of a wasp's nest and a whispering gallery, I should imagine."
               "Pray don't let me convey a false impression," said her fellow-traveller, eagerly; "it is a very pleasant place, and the strongest proof that I really think so, is the fact that I live there myself from choice. Not in the slightest degree from necessity, I assure you; but entirely from choice. Being unattached, both professionally and socially, I am free to roam where I like, but I prefer a fixed residence at Tattleton."
               "That indeed proves your appreciation of its merits," said Marian. Then reflecting that she might extract some useful information from this talkative stranger, she added, "Among a townful of gossips there must be some preeminent professors of the art and mystery of injuring other people's characters. Can you tell me who are the chief representatives of Mrs. Grundy at Tattleton?"
               "Ah!" he replied, shaking his head slowly, "there you tempt me upon ground, on which, though no angel, I really fear to tread. Had I been a fool as (pardon me) you possibly expected to find me, I might have answered your apparently artless, but really diplomatic question, by mentioning some name which, it is just possible, you might have recognized as that of a friend. But your humble servant rather prides himself on being a man of the world."
               "But in this instance your worldly wisdom is at fault," said Marian, interrupting him, "I assure you I do not know so much as the name of a single person in Tattleton."
               "And yet you are going there!" said the stranger, with a quick, inquisitive manner, that showed how anxious he was to discover the object of her journey. A gesture of assent being her only reply, he was compelled to fall back on general conversation, in order to draw her out to afford him some foundations on which to raise guesses.
               "Yes,—our dear little town can boast of many a attractions; though, if you are going there for pleasure, you have chosen about the dullest time of the year, as many of the best families are either in London, or are gone to the seaside."
               "Indeed!" said Marian, with great apparent interest. She devised his purpose, and determined to make no admissions that might give him a chance of attaining it; and such a remark certainly committed her to nothing.
               "We possess one of the most singular social institutions that I ever met with," continued the gentleman, talking away to, throw her off her guard; "in the centre of our town there is a rather spacious market-place; and in the centre of that is a paved space, where, in full view of the greater part of the population, the gentlemen have a habit of walking, up and down, puffing their cigars, and talking." 
               "Do you think it wonderful for gentlemen to smoke and talk?" asked she, with an assumption of simplicity. "I have known several who did little else."
               "Oh! that is not the wonderful part of my story. It is that every choice bit of scandal which circulates through the town, can generally be traced to the Parade, as this favorite promenade is called."
               "And that is far less marvellous to me than the smoking and talking phenomena," she replied, with an air of provoking placidity; "idle men are always more inveterate gossips than idle women; because, however idle a woman may be, she has always some little occupation, even if it be nothing more intellectual than crochet. But the thoroughly idle man has no earthly resource except smoke and scandal."
               "I'll bet a little wager," thought she, "that I've fallen in with the veriest Paul Pry in the place. What fun it would be to make him suspect me to being a member of the Swell Mob!"
               This idea had no sooner entered her head than she commenced acting the part which she desired to assume; asking innumerable questions concerning the leading families of Tattleton, and appearing to make mental notes of his replies.
               Yet it was not till they actually arrived at Tattleton tleton station that she succeeded in awakening his 
                     supicions
                     suspicions
                  .
               Her luggage was all directed to be left at the station till called for; but instead of looking after its safety, as she undoubtedly would have done under other circumstances, she left it to the care of Providence, (and the railway guards and porters) and walked straight out of the station. Her fellow-traveller had to seek and claim his luggage; during which operation, Marian, consulting no one except a guide-post, jumped over a stile, and amused herself for awhile by watching through the hedge his fruitless endeavors to discover in which direction she had disappeared.
               Then, following the pleasant field-path, under the shadow of a row of branching elms, she bent her steps towards "Home."
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               HOME AT LAST.
               MARIAN HARLEY had ascertained, before leaving London, that Upton Manor was just three miles from the station, and that it could be reached by pleasant shady lanes and meadow pathways.
               She had therefore resolved to walk to it, instead of rumbling along the dusty high-road in a hired fly, encumbered with luggage. This arrangement enabled her to carry out her practical joke upon her inquisitive fellow-traveller, without involving her in the smallest amount of scandal on its discovery. A good deal of ridicule would fall upon him, and that would be all. She well knew the full value of her position as Lady of Upton Manor.
               It was the twenty-sixth day of June. The sky was without a cloud. The intensely blue vault brought out in strong contrast the vivid green of the trees, and the rich red and yellow tints of the meadows, where the sorrel and buttercup strove for mastery, till the scythe—fatal emblem of Time,—should blow then both to his iron rule.
               
               The birds were silent in the deep hush of the noon. Only the grasshoppers,—those little red republicans that no tyranny of the hot sun can silence,—chirped unceasingly amid the tall grass; and the corn-craik uttered his monotonous, but pleasing note; and where a lime-tree offered its dense and fragrant shadow, the bees, like Anglo-Saxon traders, working where others seek repose, kept up the perpetual murmur of business.
               Marian walked quietly on. She knew that, at a short distance before her, a distance that her little feet, with their little steps, were gradually lessening,—lay her home. Her own—her mother's home.
               Her talkative companion was forgotten; Tattleton might have been hundreds of miles away.
               She wandered on through a little wood where the wild strawberries grew in profusion.
               At the farther end a gate opened into a shady lane, beyond which there was a hay-field, where the laborers were turning the fragrant burthen of the teeming earth.
               A boy carrying a small keg of cider slouched lazily along the lane.
               "Whose field is that, my lad?" said Marian. "Thick theere?" replied the young clown, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder, "he do belong to the Manor, he do."
               "Thank you," said Marian; then added, when he was out of hearing, "My field! My hay! Oh! It smells sweeter than ever before any hay could smell! I think I am going crazy! or I'm going to have a new kind of hay-fever!"
               With a laugh at herself, she hastened through the gate. The lane led her on and on, through sweet windings where the wild rose still bloomed, and the honeysuckle wooed her with its delicious fragrance.
               Another scene of rural life met her gaze. Six or seven cows stood cooling themselves in a pond, while an old man dozed beneath a tree.
               "How far is it to Upton Manor?" she demanded, without any regard for the veteran's slumbers.
               "Mayhop half a moyle," he answered, rousing himself with an effort.
               "Whose cows are these?" she continued.
               "They do belong to the Manor," he replied.
               "What, to Mrs. Blake?"
               "Noa—she be dead."
               "Who do they belong to, then?"
               "I dunno. They do tell that there be some young ooman a-comin' to th' Manor. But I dunno for sartain sure how it be."
               "And this road will take me to the Manor, Will it?"
               "Eees—you keep straight on—you can't miss it, no how."
               She went on as he directed, but with the thought still busy in her head:
               "My cows! I think their breath was sweeter than ever the breath of cows smelt before! My old peasant! Alas! I cannot educate him into anything superior to what he now is. But I can make his poor home more comfortable—I can smooth his passage to the grave!—Oh! Merciful Father! Let me not be so entranced by my own happiness, that I forget that I should be but the medium for transmitting to others the blessings which Thou hast given me!"
               This was the substance of the prayer that swelled her grateful heart as she approached the gate of Upton Manor.
               It was not a carriage-drive with a lodge beside it. It was an unpretending little gate, leading into a shrubbery. You passed over a rapid brook by a narrow foot-bridge before you entered it; and then you found yourself on a trim lawn, in front of an old-fashioned, long, low building, with heavy mullioned windows, an entrance door in the centre, and a projecting wing at each end.
               Marian's eyes glanced over all this. They even took in the cat, who lay in the doorway with her kittens, the latter too lazy in the intense heat, even to play. And then her eyes turned to the two cedar trees—the trees her mother had loved.
               There they stood, with their vast arms outspread, as though bestowing a blessing on her who came for the first time to the abode of her fathers.
               Marian went beneath their shadow, and again prayed earnestly that she night not be led away, by the very intensity of her own happiness, to neglect or forget the duties which the change in her position entailed upon her.
               Feeling exalted by the act of prayer, she went into the house. The cat yawned at her approach, but would not stir.
               The central apartment was a specious entrance hall with a handsome staircase leading to the upper story, and a gallery running round it.
               To the right she found a large sitting-room, with its old-fashioned furniture arranged in perfect order.
               To the left was a similar apartment, which appeared to have been less used, though the shelves, many of which were loaded with books, proclaimed it to be the library.
               Marian seated herself in an easy-chair, near one of the open windows. The deep stillness of the midsummer noon brooded over everything, within and without, only broken occasionally by the hoarse cry of a distant hay-maker to the docile team, or the buzzing of a stray bee that made the circuit of the silent room, and hummed itself out again. The very grasshoppers were mute,—the very aspen leaves were motionless. Only man and the bee were still at work.
               Outside, on a sweeping bough of one of those cedar trees which she had been so anxious to behold, a stately peacock basked in the sunbeams.
               "And this little Paradise is mine!" murmured Marian, while tears of joy and gratitude filled her eyes; "this is the room where my mother passed so many happy hours in her childhood. Those are the books that she used to read; sometimes in this very chair perhaps, and often among the branches of those dear old trees! Oh! if she were only living now to enjoy it as her own! And it should be her own, though she always said Aunt Martha would never leave it to her, but that I should some day possess it. Yet I would give it to her if she still lived! For it is all mine! How sweet the new hay smells! That is mine! The cedars are mine! The peacock is mine! All those lovely sweet-scented flowers are mine! It is all mine! Oh! I shall go crazy on the bump of acquisitiveness at this rate. It will never do. It is mine to do good with;—mine, to improve;—mine, to hold in trust for the benefit of others. I must not forget that. And yet—Oh! it is delightful to possess all this,—and to have the power of doing so much good! I must find somebody to speak to, or I shall begin to doubt all about it. Already I don't quite know whether I am myself or somebody else. I don't like this feeling at all."
               Yet it was a very natural one. During the previous day she had been too much agitated by Mr. Fitzgerald's letter, and too much occupied by the necessity of writing a suitable reply to it, to be able to eat anything. The bustle of her early departure had prevented her taking any breakfast, except a cup of coffee; she had subsequently had a long journey through the fresh air, and a walk of three miles. The consequence was, that she was faint with hunger, though the variety of pleasurable emotions which she experienced prevented her becoming aware of it.
               She arose, and the faintness left her; and, after glancing into another room beyond the library, occupying one of the wings, and forming a pleasant summer parlor, she proceeded to the large old kitchen, which lay at the back of the house.
               That was indeed something like a kitchen! A huge fireplace, as large as many a London bedroom, yawned at one end; and, midsummer notwithstanding, a heap of wood ashes smouldering in its midst, showed that nothing but the stimulus of a faggot was required to send a roaring blaze up the wide chimney.
               A long oaken table, so substantial that it had probably not been moved for a century, stood in the middle of the room, and the beams were thickly hung with hams and sides of bacon, many of which were also visible within the chimney, in the process of smoking.
               Strong heavy chairs and settles were hanged neatly round the walls, a large old-fashioned eight day clock ticked solemnly in a corner; the dresser and shelves exhibited an array of bright utensils of brass, copper and tin, with crockery that looked as if it were washed every day, whether used or not. In fact the very genius of cleanliness presided over the place, while the more ornamental graces were represented by a row of flower-pots filled with fuchsias and geraniums, that adorned the long, low, diamond-paned casement.
               
               Still no human being was visible; and animated life was only represented by an old sheep-dog that lay extended by the hearth, a cat rolled in a ball among the flower-pots, and the inevitable cricket chirping among the ashes.
               The old dog raised his head as she entered, seemed satisfied with her appearance, for he lowered his fragmentary ears, and moved as though by a wild stretch of imagination, he supposed himself to be wagging the tail that nature or art had denied to him, and stretching his legs, resigned himself again to somnolency.
               "This is like coming into the Castle of Indolence, or the palace of the Sleeping Beauty," said Marian. "I wonder where I shall find anybody awake. I'll go back to the library, and ring the bell."
               Instead, however of returning to the library, she entered the room on the opposite side of the entrance hall, which had been her aunt's usual sitting-room, and placing herself in a high-backed chair that stood near a work-table, she gave a vigorous pull at the bell-rope.
               Her summons was responded to by a shrill scream from the direction of the kitchen, followed by loud exclamations in a female voice.
               "Oh! my goodness gracious me!" it exclaimed, "that's the Missus's bell! Jane! Sally! come! for goodness' sake! I daren't for my life go in alone! Come, girls! Come! Make haste! Oh dear! Oh dear! What can it be?—; Jane! Make haste! Leave them things alone, I tell 'ee!"
               "Lauks! Missus what be the matter?" demanded another voice.
               There—I don't know!" replied the first speaker "but I heard the Missus's parlor bell ring as plain as I hear you speak! I did indeed; and look there! It's not done shaking yet!"
               Acting on this hint, Marian pulled the bell again, more sharply than before. A double scream responded; and the two first voices were heard in rapid but almost indistinguishable colloquy, when they were joined by a third, to the owner of which the terrible phenomenon was explained.
               "Now I do say it be a mortal shame, Mrs. Farncombe," said the new comer, "it's bad enough of she to ring you up o' nights, without setting to at that same work in the daytime. But Lord ha' mussy! it may be some strange folk that has comed in, and wants to say zummat to somebody. Let's go in, all three on us, one old ooman's ghost can't do we no harm. Besides I beant afeered of ghostisses in broad day light. Come along."
               "You go, first then, Sally, as you bean't afeared," said Mrs. Farncombe, "I don't blush to own that I feel mortal bad."
               Steps in the passage and the apparition of a rosy-cheeked country girl peeping in at the door, 
                     fol-
                     followed
                   this avowal.
               "It beant the old Missus," whispered the girl, drawing hastily back, "it be indeed a young lady."
               Mrs. Farncombe entered at once, on this comforting forting announcement. She was a tall, stout active dame, about sixty years of age, with a fresh, hale complexion, a keen hazel eye, and features that still bore the traces of considerable beauty.
               "Lord bless us, and save us!" she ejaculated, as Marian turned her smiling face towards her, without uttering a word. "If I don't think it be—please, Ma'am, what may you please to want?" she added, apologetically.
               "Is the Mistress of the house at home?" asked Marian.
               "If it beant her own voice!" exclaimed Mrs. Farncombe, advancing. "Well, Ma'am, I do make so bold as to hope she be—Oh! Miss, do 'ee tell us, beant you our Miss Marian's daughter?"
               "Yes, I am!" cried Marian, starting up, "and you, I know, are dear Mrs. Farncombe! My poor mamma used to tell me all about you, and how good you always were to her!"
               And she clasped the old friend round her neck, and kissed her like a child, and finally laid her head on her broad bosom, and sobbed.
               "There—there—" said the old lady, soothingly, "the last time I ever set eyes on your dear mother, was the night she ran away, and she kissed me just like that, and she says, 'Nursey,' says she, 'I'll come back to you some day,' she says,—but she never did, and I know she never can now, for she's dead and gone, poor soul! But I seem that she's back now, you be so like her, my dear!"
               "There! I've done crying now," cried Marian, wiping the tears from her sparkling eyes. I don't know why I did it, for I feel so happy!"
               "Lord love ye! And so you ought to be!—But why didn't you send to say as you was a coining, honey? I'd have had something ready for you, for I'm sure you must be hungered; and I've got nothing in the house."
               "Nothing in the house!" exclaimed Marian, "and all those hams and sides of bacon hanging up! Are they only wooden things put there for show?"
               "Well—but who'd give a young lady bacon for dinner?"
               "You will, I'm sure, if I ask for it. Besides, have you no bread? No eggs? No cheese? No butter? No milk? No nothing?"
               "Oh, yes," replied the old lady, laughing, "we've ha' got plenty of them things."
               "Then give me something to eat directly, for I'm famishing with hunger. I should like some eggs and bacon above everything."
               While this savory, but homely dish was in course of preparation, Marian wandered over the rest of the house, and selected her sleeping-room avoiding that in which her aunt had died, and choosing the one that had been occupied by her mother.
               In the afternoon, having sent one of the men with a cart to the station for her luggage, she went out into the hay-field, and enjoyed the immense satisfaction of raking up some of her own hay, and watching the operation of stacking it.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               BLESSINGS OF COUNTRY LIFE.
               DURING several days Marian was exceedingly busy. She visited every cottage on her little estate; acquainted herself with the characters, families, habits, occupations, wants and wishes of all her humble tenants; made a survey of all her own fields and other possessions; collected quite a small library of books on agriculture, farming, gardening, the management of cattle, poultry, pigeons, geese, &c., which she studied at every spare moment; and, in short worked as hard as a Prime Minister.
               When Sunday came she went to church. Not to St. Mary Magdalene's, at Tattleton, as Mrs. Farncombe wished her to do, to show off one of her handsome London made robes and Parisian bonnets, but to the old family pew in little Upton church, and attired in a simple muslin dress, and plain straw bonnet.
               This event had been anticipated by some of the good people of Tattleton, several of whom had walked or driven to the lowly village church in the expectation of getting a peep at the heiress, the news of whose arrival had caused a profound sensation in the town.
               The intelligence had been, in the first instance, possessed by the station-master, who obtained it from the driver of the cart, when he fetched the handsome trunks directed "Miss Harley, Tattleton Station—To be left till called for," which had already excited some interest among the railway officials. The station-master having formerly held a lieutenant's commission in her majesty's army, was free of "the parade," and being often in possession of scraps of exclusive information, (officially obtained) which he was generally ready to communicate, his appearance on the Tattleton Scandal Exchange was always welcome.
               On the morning of Marian's arrival he had carried the intelligence of the supposed arrival of a certain Miss Harley, apparently a person of importance, as his contribution to the group of loungers who usually awaited him as he passed by on his way to dinner. But he found few to give ear either to his report or his speculations, so absorbed were they all in a piece of news just communicated by Dr. McCorquodale, of his having travelled from town with a most suspicious character, who, he had no doubt, was a pioneer of a gang of London swindlers, sent forward to obtain information from unwary fellow-passengers and others, previous to the arrival of her accomplices.
               "Which way did she go when she left the station tion?" demanded Captain Clarke—the Tattletonians gave him this title by courtesy.
               "Ah! that's just what I should like to know!" replied Marian's gossipping fellow-traveller. "I saw her walk straight away, without looking for any luggage, which, I take it, was a strong proof that she had none; for, you know, if she had had any, it is not in woman's nature to avoid making a fuss about it. I was then obliged to take my eyes off her for a moment, in order to secure my own portmanteau, and in that short interval she disappeared. She did not come up by the omnibus, for I was in it myself, and should have seen her; and she did not walk along the road, for I kept a sharp lookout for her. Now, the question is, which way did she go?"
               No one being able to throw the smallest light upon this important point, every one was naturally ready with an opinion; and in the midst of the confusion of tongues Captain Clarke hurried away, partly to attend to his duties, and partly to interrogate his subordinates respecting the mysterious lady, so as to be beforehand in obtaining any information they might possess concerning her, if any of the town loungers should come to the station on the same errand.
               Nothing, however, could be gleaned from them. There was the cancelled ticket, easily distinguishable from that which had been in the pocket of Dr. McCorquodale, which smelt strongly of tobacco, while hers was fragrant with some delicate perfume fume. These two were the only "through" passengers from London, and one of the porters recollected receiving the ticket from a lady who was a stranger to him. But as he was also a stranger, he took no notice of her, and did not remark which way she went.
               At about five o'clock the cart from Upton Manor House arrived for Miss Harley's luggage.
               "Who is Miss Harley, Sam?" asked Captain Clarke of the messenger, whom he knew well.
               "Whoy, she be our young Missus. Don't 'ee know?"
               "No, indeed, I did not. What! old Mrs. Blake's niece?"
               "Eees, zure."
               "When do you expect her to arrive?"
               "Whoy, don't 'ee know she comed this mornin'?"
               "No, did she though?" exclaimed the station-master, highly excited, all at once. "Dressed in black silk, was she? With a straw bonnet? Came by the seven-thirty from Paddington?"
               "Noa,—they do tell I she comed from Lunnon. She walked into the house as quiet as a mouse about noontime, and frit Mrs. Farncombe and the mides (maids) terrible, wi' ringing of the old Missus' parlor bell."
               "But was she dressed in black silk?" urged the Captain.
               "Well now, I can't zay for zure and sartain; but it were a zummut black, for thinks I that's a vuunny color for a purty young mide to be dressed in; only, mayhap, it's mourning for the old lady."
               "Dressed in black—came from town—walked to Upton!" said the station-master triumphantly to himself; "if I don't roast McCorquodale! There's the lady's luggage, Sam. How many packages did you say?"
               "There should be zix on 'em," replied Sam, "and there they be, zure enough. I wonder what's inside of 'em now! It's mainly onpossible for one young ooman to put all the clothes upon her back that them gurt chestisses would hold."
               "All clothes, nevertheless, Sam, I'll be bound. Look sharp, and your weak mind will be astonished at what will come out of those trunks. That's it—put them in carefully. Good-day!"
               It may be imagined with what glee the station-master indemnified himself for the small attention which the male gossips had vouchsafed to him in the morning, and tantalized them with his special information before he confided to them the grand discovery he had made.
               It may also be imagined how very small poor Dr. McCorquodale was made to appear, before his victorious adversary had done with him.
               I must also leave to the imagination of my reader, the various forms which the whole story took as it circulated through the town.
               On one point alone everybody was agreed,—the heiress of Upton Manor had arrived, and taken possession of her property. On another point also the utmost unanimity prevailed—everybody wanted to see her. Consequently those who, judging probably by themselves, supposed that she would come to Tattleton on Sunday, to show herself to the greatest number of her neighbors, crowded the principal church in the town; while several who expected that she would drive in, loitered on the road to Upton; and others, who judged by her former walking exploit that she would prefer coming through the fields, went on foot to her parish church, thinking they would thus catch her in any case.
               At Upton church their curious eyes were gratified by the sight of a neat white bonnet, and a rather handsome, very serious face. Marian was conscious that many, indeed most of the congregation looked hard at her; but she was not aware till Mrs. Farncombe afterwards informed her of the fact, how many among them had come expressly from Tattleton to catch a glimpse of her.
               Had she known this earlier, she would hardly have been able to preserve so calm and unmoved an exterior during the service.
               The only person with whom she had formed an acquaintance during her few days sojourn at the Manor House, was the curate, and him she had invited to dine with her; but as she walked quickly through the churchyard, uncomfortably conscious now that people were covertly watching her, she encountered her talkative railway companion, who raised his hat, and saluted her with a profound bow.
               
               Marian had no wish to involve herself with promiscuous acquaintanceships; so she merely recognized his civility by a slight inclination, and turned into the side-path which led to the Manor House.
               "I wonder whether any one has told her that you took her for a swindler," remarked Captain Clarke, to the somewhat discomfited doctor, "she looked deucedly inclined to cut you."
               "Oh! nothing of the kind, my good friend, nothing of the kind," replied Dr. McCorquodale confidently, "she smiled most graciously, I assure you, though you did not see it. I consider that her recognition of me was highly flattering. And I should hope that no one would be so foolish and ill-natured as to repeat to the lady my little practical joke about the swell mob."
               "It was no practical joke, Dr. Mac," joined in another Tattletonian, who had been one of the most devout believers in his alarming story; "you were thoroughly convinced of the truth of what you said; so much so, indeed, that you half-persuaded me that there might be something in it, and you well know that I am not easily taken in."
               Dr. Mac's good humor was completely restored by the sly laugh that greeted this assertion, for the speaker was well known as the easiest dupe in all Tattleton.
               The appearance of the clergyman, proceeding from the vestry towards the gate leading to the Manor House, dispersed the group of gossips, while it afforded them fresh matter for speculation.
               "Going to dine with her, I'll lay a guinea," said the gentleman who did not believe in his own gullibility—"hardly prudent that, I think, in so young a lady."
               "The clergy always look after the leaves and fishes," returned Dr. Mac, sententiously; "out of every hundred well-to-do widows and spinsters, you will find that ninety-nine are caught up by curates. At least that has been the result I have arrived at, after a pretty long, and tolerably extensive experience of the world. What is your fall opinion, Popham?"
               Dr. Mac's worldly experience was a trump-card with which he always managed to take up his adversaries' tricks, whenever he had a difference with his fellow-townsmen; and his superiority, in this respect was so well-known, and so generally acknowledged, that any appeal to it, and tacit challenge to the others, was sure to end in a triumph for himself. In the present instance they all agreed that the clergy were fortune-hunters to a man; and McCorquodale chuckled to himself at having turned them off from his blunder about the lady swindler.
               Marian, in the meantime, all unconscious of the comical gossip of which she was the subject, was doing her best to entertain and enliven her guest, whose quiet, melancholy face, when she had met him in the cottage of a sick villager, and the information she had subsequently obtained respecting him from Mrs. Farncombe, that he was only the curate, that he had been at Upton for nearly a year, that he was very poor, and that he was generally believed to be engaged to a young lady in London, because he wrote regularly twice a week to a Miss Smith, and received a letter written in a female hand every Monday evening. It was further supposed that his melancholy arose from his marriage being delayed on account of his poverty, and the precarious tenure of even his present poor curacy.
               "Here is a splendid opportunity for making somebody share my happiness!" thought Marian, "How can I best set about it?"
               After a little reflection, she decided to ask him to dinner on Sunday, and afterwards, under the soothing influence of a bottle of her aunt's fine old wine, to endeavor to win his confidence.
               There was no service at Upton church in the afternoon, so the poor parson was quite at the artful lady's mercy, and as soon as the substantial, homely dinner was over, she invited him to the shade of one of her favorite cedars, to finish the repast with a dessert, furnished by her own garden.
               "You are fond of fruit Mr. Hunter," said Marian, observing how he lingered dreamily over the flavor of a strawberry; "I have such an abundance that I really don't know what to do with it, so I shall take the liberty of sending you some. And vegetables too—how are you off for them? Have you a good garden at the parsonage?"
               "There is a very large garden, Miss Harley, but as I could not afford to cultivate it, I have let it off to a gardener, at a very low rent, however, in consideration of his liability to be turned out of possession at any moment, if the curacy should pass out of my hands."
               "Is there any likelihood of such an event?" asked Marian.
               "It is always doubtful," he replied, with a sad, patient smile. "The rector has a nephew who is fond of fieldsports. The country round here is full of game, and if the young man should express a wish to use Upton parsonage as a shooting box, my claim would not be regarded as any impediment."
               "That would be perfectly scandalous!" exclaimed the young lady, warmly. "What! turn out a minister who does his duty, and attends to the poor, in order to give up his house for the pleasure of a racketty sportsman! I am new to these matters, Mr. Hunter, and do not know what interest I may possess as Lady of the Manor. Will you, therefore, inform me whether I have any power to prevent such a violation of right and decency?"
               "Not during the life of the present incumbent, Madam. After his death the living is, I believe, at your disposal."
               "Take some more strawberries, Mr. Hunter," said Marian, starting away from a subject on which she did not wish to express herself clearly just at present; "I like to see you eat them. You seem to enjoy them so much."
               "I am ashamed that you should have noticed it, Miss Harley," he replied, blushing deeply; "and yet, perhaps, as you are so full of sympathies yourself, you will understand and pardon my weakness. While dwelling on the delicious taste of the fruit I was thinking of a very dear friend who is far away, and to whose palate I wished I could convey the enjoyment by the sympathetic power of mesmerism?"
               "Can't we send her some? What is the distance?"
               "Too far, I fear, for the execution of your kind wish," he said, his eyes sparkling, however, at the bare idea. "She is in London."
               "Miss Smith," thought Marian. "This wine," she said aloud, running away again from the subject as soon as she had brought him up to it, and filling his glass as she spoke, "is, I understand, of a very fine quality. I am quite unable to form any opinion about it myself, further than to know that it is very nice. What do you think of it? Gentlemen are always judges of wine. Especially gentlemen of the clerical profession, I have heard."
               "That is no doubt true of the bishops and rectors, and other church dignitaries," he replied, with a real hearty laugh, "but we poor curates have very few opportunities of cultivating our tastes in this way. All that I can say of the wine is just what you said—it is very nice."
               "Then let us drink to your speedy promotion, Mr. Hunter. I wish you may speedily have a living, and all that can make you happy."
               "Thanks—thanks!" he murmured. "God only knows how fervently I echo that wish—yet not for myself, but for another."
               "There is another, then, whose happiness depends on you?" said Marian, fixing her eyes keenly on the curate's face. "Oh! Mr. Hunter! don't be shocked at my abruptness! You are startled—but pray pause, and hear me out, before you set me down for an impertinent, meddling creature, and decline to answer my question. I know I am but a young woman, and have no right to pry into your family secrets. I know I am inexperienced, and may jump straight at the matter I have at heart, with less tact and circumspection than a worldly person would. But believe me, my object is to use the means which Providence has so mercifully placed at my disposal, to diffuse happiness and comfort on all around me. So please forget I am young and inexperienced; think I am an old lady—your mother—your grandmother, if you will—who wants to know why your are always sad—why you think sorrowfully of some one who is far away—and what can be done to remove the causes of your sadness? You do not know, perhaps, that I have eaten the bitter bread of dependence—that I have been obliged to submit to the tyranny of a coarse mind, and that my prosperity dates but from a few weeks ago. It is on that account that I can feel so strongly for sufferings that may perhaps resemble my own. But you must tell me— I may guess, but cannot know with any certainty. So pray confide in me. Think I am your grandmother!"
               "You completely overpower me, Miss Harley," faltered the curate, in whose breast the wildest hopes arose as the enthusiastic girl uttered, with wonderful volubility, her well-intentioned, but fearfully illogical speech; "the cause of my sorrow lies in the one word, Poverty. I am a curate, with a salary of forty pounds a year."
               "And she?" suggested Marian.
               "And she,", he added, with a heavy sigh, "is wasting her youth, her health, and her strength, in a London dressmaker's establishment."
               "She shan't stay there a day longer!" cried Marian, starting up; "come in and write to her at once. There's plenty of time. I'll send the letter to Tattleton if the post has gone from here. Or would you rather take the first train to-morrow and fetch her? Or will you go to-night?"
               "My dear lady,—you take my breath away!" said Mr. Hunter, rising too, but leaning on his chair for support; "before I take so decisive a step, I must know what the result will be. What is to become of her if she gives up the present miserable pittance,—which is at least a certainty."
               "Yes, true—you are wiser than I am," said Marian, quieted down by his gravity; "I ought to have explained myself; and after all, she might not like the position that I wish to offer her. I am alone here, Mr. Hunter. I require a lady as companion panion. Will your friend undertake the office? The duties will not be irksome, and the salary is sixty pounds a year. There now—is that more business-like?"
               "It is thoroughly business-like, Miss Harley," he replied, quitting his chair, and grasping her hand with a force that made her wince, "and I will write at once, as you suggested."
               "Why not go, as I suggested?"
               "It will be best to write," he said hurriedly, "it will give her time for reflection."
               "But if you are there, she will have the opportunity for discussion, which is better than solitary reflection."
               He blushed and still hesitated. Marian read his thoughts in a moment, and bidding him await her return, she ran into the house.
               "There is another reason why I very much wish you to go to-night, instead of writing to-morrow," she said, as she returned with a little packet in her hand. "I am very apt to judge of others by myself, Mr. Hunter; and I know that when I first went to a situation, I should have been so glad if my employers had offered me a little money in advance; therefore I want you to take charge of a quarter's salary for Miss—what did you say her name was?"
               "Smith—Lucy Smith," he replied, uttering the name tenderly and lovingly; "how kind—how very considerate you are, Miss Harley! How can I thank you sufficiently both for Lucy and myself!"
               
               "My good sir, is it not just what you would do for me, if our cases were reversed? Then why make a wonder of it? It is very simple, I think; and it also seems very simple to me that, as you are going a journey on my business, I should pay your travelling expenses," and she laid the little packet on the table. As the curate remained silent, Marian raised her eyes timidly to his face, fearing that she might have pained him by not being sufficiently circumspect and delicate in her ministration; but, his moistened eyes, and the mingled feelings of delight, gratitude, affection and admiration, which his countenance expressed, showed that the emotions which kept him silent were pleasurable and not painful.
               "I will go," he said at last, with an evident effort, and in a husky voice. "I cannot find words to thank you. At some future time I trust I shall be able to prove my gratitude; but not now—I 
                     can-
                     cannot
                   find utterance for my feelings now. Oh! God bless you, Miss Harley! I believe you have saved my Lucy's life."
               "Now, run home and pack your carpet-bag," said Marian, with the playful authority of a sister, "tea will be ready on your return, and then we shall have plenty of time to drive down to the station in my pony-chaise. You must try to persuade Miss Smith to return with you to-morrow, if possible; though of course she is the only person who can decide about the feasibility of leaving her present situation at an hour's notice. However it may be, you must let me know, either by letter or telegram, that I may send the chaise to meet you. The walk would be too much for her, perhaps."
               "Thoughtful in everything!" said Mr. Hunter. "I will return in ten minutes."
               "Poor fellow! he is quite overpowered," said Marian to herself, as after slipping her packet into his breast pocket, he hastened with uneven steps out of the garden. "Was the wine rather too strong for him, I wonder? Or, is it only the pleasure of freeing his Lucy from her thraldom? Perhaps it is the effect of both. I know I should never have had the courage to bolt out my proposal as I did, if I had not taken a glass of it. I wonder what the living is worth, and whether it really is in my gift, and how old the present incumbent is? I must find all that out, and then ask the opinion of other parishioners, for it would never do to give them a rector whom they don't like. Though I can't well see what they could object to in Mr. Hunter."
               As she thus soliloquized, Marian Harley was feeding the peacock with biscuit. Rousing herself from her reverie, she ran into the house and gave directions for tea to be prepared, the pony to be harnessed in time for the mail train, and some refreshment to be got ready for Mr. Hunter's consolation on his journey.
               All her little plans were duly carried out; and as she drove in silence to the station, wondering in her own mind when the automaton by her side would recover the use of his tongue, and hoping it might happen before he was required to preach another sermon, the curate began to talk.
               "Miss Harley," he said, "suppose you were not to like my poor Lucy when you see her?"
               "Do you think that what I propose will be of service to her?" was Marian's counter-question, "do you think I intend it as a kindness?"
               "How can there be two opinions on that point?" he replied, warmly. "You intend it as a kindness, and it will be, in this world, her salvation."
               "Then rest satisfied about my liking her. I shall be sure to like her, unless she is a very disagreeable person. Is Miss Lucy Smith a very disagreeable person, Mr. Hunter?" she asked, with a ridiculous drawl.
               "She's the sweetest girl that ever lived!" he exclaimed.
               "Then I've no doubt we shall get on very well together," said Miss Harley. "By-the-bye—have you brought a railway rug?"
               This sudden leap from the heights of sentiment to the flat level of common-place, threw the enthusiastic lover into a fit of laughter; but it also elicited the fact that the careful young lady had brought a warm wrapper for him in the carriage.
               Marian saw him off, all smiles and hopefulness, and drove quietly home, with a spirit as calm and peaceful as the unclouded sky above her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               MORNING CALLS.
               MISS HARLEY's appearance at church being taken by the good country folks as an official announcement of her residence at the Manor, she received a number of morning calls on the following day.
               Among others, Dr. McCorquodale presented himself, in the favorable position of escort to Mrs. Bowyer, the wife of the Rev. Mr. Bowyer, rector of St. Mary's, Tattleton.
               Marian's gracious reception convinced him that she had, as yet, heard nothing about his having spread a report that she was a member of a gang of swindlers; so, considering that in this case, decision in taking the initiative would be the better part of valor, he gave her and the assembled company a humorous, though I am sorry to add, not a strictly correct report of the panic he had created by his description of the mysterious lady with whom he had travelled from London.
               While the tide of gossip was at the flood, a telegram gram was brought in, which Marian left unopened on the table beside her.
               The conversation which just before was so lively, now sensibly flagged. Ladies began a sentence, and forgot what they were about to say, as their glances fell upon the sealed envelope. In fact they could scarcely keep their eyes off it at all; and even Dr. McCorquodale's sharp, jackdaw optics were frequently directed towards it. Mrs. Bowyer at length came to the rescue.
               "Now, my dear Miss Harley;" she began, "why do you stand on so much ceremony with us? We were all friends of your late Aunt, and we hope to be friends of yours, so why should you treat us as such total strangers?"
               "What do you mean, Mrs. Bowyer?" demanded Marian, naively.
               "You must be dying to read your telegram, and yet you leave it there, unopened, out of politeness to your visitors."
               "Is that it?" said Marian, laughing; "the outside of it is enough for me, I assure you. I know quite well what it contains. Nevertheless, if it will afford you any satisfaction, I will peep into it."
               As she did so, they all watched her.
               Dr. Mac walked to the window and made some remarks upon the improvements in the shape of fresh flower beds, and a tank for gold fish, that Marian was making in the garden.
               The eager gossips, meanwhile, could make absolutely nothing of their hostess's unmoved countenance nance as she glanced at the telegram, and laid it down again.
               "If this place were mine," said Mrs. Nettleship, who was a cousin of Mrs. Bowyer's, and the widow of a barrister, "I should have that great tree cut down, and the shrubbery beyond cleared away, and the hedge cut down quite low, so as to get a good view of the road."
               "Cut down one of the cedars!" exclaimed Marian perfectly aghast at the proposed sacrilege; "I would not have a single branch of either of them touched! Oh! do come out and look at them, and then you can examine my little fish-pond,—do you not know that of all trees, the cedar is the most musical? I suppose it is from the horizontal growth of the boughs, but whatever may be the cause, the effect is certain. And you would have me do away with this glorious anthem of nature's own composing!"
               They had been about half an hour in the garden when a carriage stopped at the gate, and an elderly lady, tall, thin, dark, hook-nosed, and hawk-eyed, accompanied by a gentleman who, though apparently not more than thirty years of age, and with his features that every one must own were incontestably handsome, was yet undeniably fat, sauntered up the path towards the house.
               "I'll introduce them," said the rector's lady, rushing forwards. "My dearest Miss Grimshaw! I am so delighted at this opportunity of rendering you the delightful service of introducing you to our charming young friend,"—
               "The old cat's worth a heap of money," whispered Dr. Mac to Marian.
               "And it is such an unexpected pleasure to see you out of your own domicile"—
               "It's done for some purpose," said Mac, as before, "for she never comes out, for fear of spoiling that lovely bonnet which she bought in the year one."
               "Let me have the pleasure of presenting you to our charming young friend, Miss Harley, though I can only claim to be a friend of one hour's earlier date. But I am sure she will excuse me. We are both old friends of her dear departed Aunt, Miss Grimshaw,"—and here Mrs. Rector's handkerchief was hoisted half-mast high, i.e., to her eyes—"and so it is not as though we came to her as utter strangers. And permit me also, my sweet young friend, to present to you our dear friend, Miss Grimshaw's nephew, Mr. Littleboy."
               "I am very happy to see you, Miss Grimshaw," said Marian, offering her hand to the stiff-backed old spinster; "your name is quite familiar to me, from having often heard my mother speak of you. Have you come far? Perhaps you will walk in, and take a little refreshment."
               "We have only come from Tattleton, and I do not require anything, I assure you. My nephew had better take something; he is so very delicate. Do you feel faint, Theodore, dear?"
               "Yes, Aunt," replied the interesting youth, in a lachrymose tone, "the heat of the weather is dreadfully oppressive! I shall be very glad to accept Miss Harley's kind offer, for I feel that I require a little support."
               "Do you really find this weather too warm?" said Marian, leading the way towards the house, closely accompanied by Mr. Littleboy, who seemed to have suddenly had a little animation infused into him—"I find it delightful!"
               A substantial luncheon had been spread during their absence, and the whole party sat down to it, amid exclamations of "Dear me! Quite unexpected, I'm sure!" "This is really delightful!" "What charming hospitality!" "Oh! you really shouldn't, Miss Harley!" and "Oh! I say! ain't this stunning neither? I am so precious hungry!" from the one boy of the party, Mrs. Bowyer's youngest hopeful, a fine lad of fifteen.
               "Oh! for shame, Harry!" cried his eldest sister.
               "There's nothing to be ashamed of, Harry," said the young hostess, passing her arm through that of the boy, "except that you should have told me you were hungry."
               "I had a mind to," he replied, "you looked so jolly good-natured."
               "Oh! Harry!" cried his sister again, "when will you leave off that horrid vulgar slang? You'll quite shock Miss Harley."
               "Not at all," said Marian; "sit here by me, Harry, and remember always to tell me when you are hungry."
               "Oh! and won't I neither? Now I know you are such a brick!"
               In the meanwhile Marian had kept an eye upon the "delicate" youth. He was one of the first to enter the dining-room, and he hovered round the table for a minute, with an expression of the greatest anxiety upon his bloated face, until he finally settled down before a game-pie of promising aspect; and even then he cast uneasy glances to right and left, to see whether he had not abandoned some dish that might prove even more savory. On the whole, he found that he could not have chosen more judiciously; and though he had (slightly) pushed a lady on one side to gain that vantage ground, he could not but own to himself that it was worth the exertion.
               When once the attack upon the good cheer commenced, everybody seemed ready to do justice to it. Even those who had exclaimed with the greatest earnestness that, "Really now, Miss Harley, I don't require anything!" or, "I really could not touch any refreshment for the world!" when once they had yielded to temptation, showed some of the finest appetites.
               Marian watched with increasing amusement, the performances of the delicate invalid.
               Every one ate heartily, but Mr. Littleboy managed to dispose of more than all the other eight or nine put together. And all the time his aunt appeared to labor under the delusion that his appetite required to be tempted with dainties. And yet he never appeared to eat very fast. He shovelled enormous pieces into his mouth, and bolted them almost without the preliminary of mastication.
               All conversation was soon cut short by a commotion among the company, caused by the interesting invalid falling asleep in his chair, and nearly tumbling into his neighbor's lap!
               "If this man stuffs and gorges himself as he does, he'll go off in a fit of apoplexy, as sure as my name is Phineas McCorquodale!" exclaimed the excited voice of the late army-surgeon, while he loosened the stock of the plethoric Littleboy, and vigorously dashed cold water in his face.
               "What are you about, you brutal man?" screamed Miss Grimshaw, stuffing her handkerchief round the throat of the half awakened gourmand, at the imminent risk of strangling him, "you will give him his death of cold! His chest is so delicate!"
               "Madam!" roared the doctor, twitching the 
                     handerchief
                     handkerchief
                   out again, "if he had more to do with cold water, and less with beer and brandy,—if he would eat the proper quantity to keep him in health, and not gobble up enough to feed a parish"—
               "Oh! you insulting creature! I've no patience with you! What do you know about him? I, who have reared him from infancy, understand his constitution better than anybody—I know that he requires support."
               
               "The best thing we can do," interposed Marian, "is to leave Mr. Littleboy entirely to the care of his aunt, who doubtless understands these attacks better than any one. If you require any assistance, Miss Grimshaw, my servants will attend to your wishes. Come, ladies, shall we return to the garden?"
               She drew the half-reluctant doctor away from the very uninteresting patient, in whom, however, he seemed to find some professional attraction, saying, as she did so— 
                     
                        "'My Lord Sebastian,
                        The truths you speak do lack some gentleness,
                        And time to speak them in.'
                     
                   Can you not see, my good sir, that kind Miss Grimshaw believes too devoutly in her interesting little pet, to be able to take in good part your very just, but rather mal à propos remarks? It is perhaps very presumptuous in an inexperienced person like myself, to venture on offering an opinion to a learned professor—can you forgive me?"
               "Forgive you!" repeated Dr. Phineas McCorquodale, gently pressing the hand that rested lightly on his arm; "Ah! what might not be the life of the happy man who could always have such a sweet, sage counsellor by his side, to call back his wandering steps when he goes astray!"
               "When a gentleman pays a compliment, instead of answering a straight forward question," said Marian, gayly, "I always understand that it would be inconvenient to answer the question truthfully. Therefore I consider myself duly rebuked for my impertinent interference."
               "Who could dream of rebuking you?" sighed Dr. Mac, pressing her hand again, more tenderly than before, while his little gray eyes looked unutterable things; though it must be confessed, as he had just been eating very heartily, as he was constitutionally plethoric, as he had barely recovered from a violent fit of angry excitement, and as his military stock was both tight and high, the effort to twist his head round far enough to fire these larboard shots at the lady by his side, imparted to his countenance somewhat of the expression that one might expect in that of an amorous lobster.
               Marian did not withdraw her hand in a hurry, She simply ignored the pressure, and treated his compliments as jokes.
               "I must go back for a moment, Mrs. Bowyer," said Marian, as they reached the ladies, "or that kind-hearted Miss Grimshaw will think I have run away from her."
               "Kind-hearted Miss Grimshaw!" repeated the clergyman's wife, with a giggle, "Oh! dear! pray excuse me; but you make me laugh so, to hear you call her kind-hearted!"
               "I'm sure she must be very kind-hearted," replied Marian, who having been warned of the character of the Tattletonians, was resolved to speak in praise of everybody—"her devotion to her poor sickly nephew is quite beautiful."
               "She is fond of him, certainly, but she has not a good word for any soul besides," observed Miss Sedgeley.
               "Miss Grimshaw's whole life and energies," said Dr. McCorquodale, sententiously, "have been devoted to one pursuit,—the rearing of pigs. And though we have only had the benefit of inspecting one specimen of her peculiar system of rearing that inelegant and gluttonous animal, yet I am sure we must all agree, that in that instance she has perfectly succeeded in producing an unmitigated pig."
               Every one laughed heartily at this sally, and no one with more apparent enjoyment of it than Miss Sedgeley. But Marian, protesting against it as a libel, which she would not countenance by her presence, took the opportunity of running back to the house.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               A RAY OF SUNSHINE.
               AS Marian reëntered the house, she was met by Miss Grimshaw, who, seeing her coming across the lawn, hastened out of the dining-room.
               "Pray excuse the liberty I have taken, Miss Harley," she began, apologetically, "but I need hardly say that, in the case of an invalid. I have got my poor nephew to lie down on the sofa, and I hope in a short time he will feel quite better. I could not have anticipated one of these attacks to-day, or I would have deferred our visit."
               "I am sorry for your sake, Miss Grimshaw," said Marian, gravely, "that your nephew should be subject to attacks of this nature. It must be a constant source of anxiety to you, especially if he ever goes out to dinner, or anything of that sort, without you to take care of him."
               "Oh, as for me, I assure you I don't begrudge any trouble that he may cause me," said Miss Grimshaw.
               While Marian was puzzling her wits to find some other topic for conversation on which to engage her visitor, whose range of ideas was extremely limited, the clock over the stables striking four, with its clear, sharp tone, effected the diversion for her.
               "Oh dear!" exclaimed the anxious aunt. "I had not the faintest idea it was so late! Dear! dear! I must wake him up."
               They had wandered out into the garden during their colloquy, and Marian was now so near the open window of the dining-room that she could not but hear what Miss Grimshaw said to her nephew to rouse him from his lethargic sleep.
               "Theodore! Theodore! Wake! Wake, dear! It is four o'clock, and we shall be late for dinner."
               "Eh? What?" he exclaimed, rousing himself with an effort. "Why do you let me sleep so long, Aunt? Let us go directly."
               "Stop a moment, my dear, while I tie your neckerchief; I was obliged to loosen it, you know. And your hair is all disordered."
               "Never mind my hair."
               "But you must have your hair put right. How can you expect to make a favorable impression on the heiress if she sees you such a figure?"
               "I am acquainted with your designs already, my lady," said Marian to herself, as she moved from the window; "but I don't wish to take a mean advantage of you, nor to disgrace myself by listening."
               In a short time the aunt and nephew emerged from the house; the latter looking more disgusting and unwholesome than ever. His flabby fat face was swollen and sodden with sleep, and after going through the ceremony of shaking his flaccid, oleaginous paw, Marian manifested her antipathy by skipping upstairs and washing her hands.
               "No more visitors to-day, I hope!" she soliloquized, as she gazed on the lovely prospect from her bed-room window. "It is very pleasant to do the honors of one's own house; but too much of it would be very wearisome. What funny people they are! And I suppose all the unmarried men will, as a matter of course, be captivated by 'les beaux yeux de ma cassette.'"
               The telegram which had so agitated the feelings of the ladies of Tattleton, was merely an announcement from Mr. Hunter that he and Miss Smith would arrive at the station by nine o'clock that evening. In the soft summer twilight, therefore, Marian was walking up and down the garden path, now listening to the nightingales, and now straining her ears to catch the sound of the returning wheels of her pony-chaise.
               She was very anxious to see Miss Lucy Smith, as, upon her being an agreeable person or otherwise, depended, in a considerable degree, her own domestic comfort for some months to come. She was determined 'in any case,' to make the best of it, however; and the new-comer must have an exceptionally bad temper to resist a systematic course of optimism. On one point Marian was fully satisfied, and that was, that she could never utterly regret having done a kind action.
               The rapid pat-pat of her pony's hoofs, and the roll of the light wheels, at length broke upon the stillness of the evening, and she walked down to the gate, and waited.
               The carriage stopped. It was too dark in that shady spot to see distinctly, but she heard the murmur of voices.
               "Is that you, Mr. Hunter?" cried Marian, in a cheerful, ringing tone.
               "Yes, Miss Harley, we are here, all safe, though rather tired," replied the curate; and almost at the same moment Marian heard a soft, low voice—belonging evidently to one who was inexperienced in the treacherous carrying power of the still country air,—saying "Oh Sidney! What a pleasant voice she has! I'm sure I shall like her!"
               "Give me your hand, Miss Smith," said Marian, "I will conduct you into the house while Mr. Hunter makes his arrangements. Here is a little bridge; but don't be afraid. I'll not lead you into the water. The luggage will go round to the back of the house, Mr. Hunter, so you had better leave it all as it is, unless you have anything very precious to bring out."
               "You have all that I value most under your own care, Miss Harley," he said, following close behind them. "Your generous help," he added in a whisper, "has come not a day too soon; and, I hope, not too late."
               
                  
                     Marion
                     Marian
                   made no answer; for the doubt expressed in his last words was but an echo to the fear that had arisen in her own mind, as she clasped the little attenuated hand, and felt what a weak, fragile creature was walking beside her, hardly able to utter a few flurried words of thanks and gratitude.
               Arrived in the library, she led her visitor up to the large bright lamp, held her at arm's length, and made an unceremonious, but by no means rude survey of her. She saw a delicate, pale girl of about her own age, with a countenance that was deeply interesting from its habitual expression of patient suffering, and which might, in health, be pretty. But it was so prematurely haggard, the sight was so evidently failing from overwork, the nervous energies were so overtaxed, and the physical powers so prostrated, that the kind-hearted hostess inwardly repeated the curate's prayer that help might not have come too late.
               Hope, however, is so potent an auxiliary in combating disease, that no wise physician will frighten it away with long faces and croaking commiseration.
               Marian smiled cheerfully, and obeying her fine womanly instinct, she folded the poor little homeless, trembling girl in her robust arms, imprinted an honest kiss upon her brow, and said, in that confident tone which ignores the possibility of defeat, "We will make a strong woman of her yet, Mr. Hunter!"
               "If any one can work that miracle, under God," said the curate, "I fully believe that you can, Miss Harley. But"—
               "No buts are allowed in this house, Sir," interrupted the lady peremptorily. "Help me off with this dear child's cloak and bonnet. Then she is to have some supper, and go quietly to bed. There's to be no questioning, no talking, no bother of any kind, to-night. You and I can talk over our supper, and then Miss Lucy will be able to judge whether my voice is really as pleasant as she thought it in the lane."
               "Oh! Miss Harley," faltered the poor girl, "how kind you are!—Did you indeed hear me? I did not intend it."
               "Which made the praise worth having," replied Marian, leading her towards the dining-room, where a nice hot supper was by this time spread under Mrs. Farncombe's superintendence.
               When the meal was ended, the happy though anxious lover returned to his own humble abode. Lucy Smith was consigned to a neat little white bed, more soft and comfortable, and what is of far more importance, in a more airy room, than she had occupied for years; and Marian Harley sat down by the kitchen fire, now stirred into a blaze, to consult with the old housekeeper on the best means of restoring her visitor to health and strength.
               "It's no good a-forcing of her appetite, you know, Miss," said the authority; "what we must do is to make her do things that will make her hungry, and then she'll take to her victuals kindly enough. The finest thing in the world for chest complaints is to go among the cows; let her follow them up, and breathe their breath, and the smell of the hay and all, and it 'ull do her a world of good. And when she's strong enough to get up early in the morning, if she'll only go out just at sunrise, to the camomile bed, and wash her face with the dew off the camomile flowers, in one month she'll have the loveliest complexion as ever anybody set their two blessed eyes upon."
               
                  
                     Marion
                     Marian
                   laughed at this simple charm, the real secret of which was so palpable, but smoothed the old woman's indignant brow by promising to adopt it herself as soon as Lucy could accompany her.
               "She has a very troublesome cough," said Marian, "and for that I will send for a doctor tomorrow."
               Accordingly on the morrow the carriage of the principal medical practitioner of Tattleton arrived at the Manor; and as soon as he was gone, Marian ran to Mr. Hunter with the joyful intelligence that he had unhesitatingly pronounced the patient to be quite free from any organic disease. Her lungs were sound, and her cough proceeded only from extreme debility, and would leave her as she gathered strength.
               So Miss Lucy was duly handed over to Mrs. Farncombe's mode of treatment, and in a week was so much benefited by it that she was able to commence her visits to the camomile bed.
               
               About this time also, Marian produced a correspondence which she had been carrying on with the rector, wherein he agreed to confirm Mr. Hunter in the curacy, at an advanced salary, as Miss Harley, supported by the suffrages of her co-parishioners, intended to promise him the reversion of the incumbency.
               The countenance of the young curate, always a welcome sight among the poor, was henceforward like a ray of sunshine, when he entered their cottages. And Lucy Smith too, as she went among them, at first in Marian's company and afterwards as her messenger on errands of mercy, won her way into all their hearts, especially when it became known that she was soon to be permanently settled among them, as their parson's wife.
               Marian's life seemed thus to have settled down into a state of calm and peaceful monotony that, though not at all dull, was certainly far from exciting. She was perfectly contented and happy in her narrow circle, and the society of the neighboring town afforded her sufficient amusement when a little variety was needed.
               In fact she was in that condition of uninteresting comfort in which, had I told a story about her, I might conscientiously leave her at the end of the third volume. But I have told no tale about her yet. She was but two and twenty; and the troubles and sorrows of life had not yet clouded her horizon.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               HOW JOHN MORTON LIVED.
               I TRUST that my readers have taken a sufficient interest in the patient-hearted, loving, and ill-used John Morton, to have felt some desire to know what has been his fate during all these weary months.
               The asylum in which he had been placed was a private speculation. The proprietor professed to receive a limited number of blind, deaf and dumb pupils, whom he undertook to instruct in general knowledge, and also in useful trades and occupations. He likewise guaranteed a profitable market for all articles manufactured by his inmates. No doubt he fulfilled this part of his agreement to the letter; but by far the greater portion of the proceeds of their labor found its way into his own pocket.
               Thus it happened that although John Morton worked assiduously at his trade of basket-making, and although his goods were of the most beautiful and delicate description, he failed to realize as much money as he got for less labor of an interior sort at Tattleton. It is true that his expenses were heavier. A variety of items was always tacked on to his weekly account, and he had besides to pay for the hire of books, and a reader to read them to him. At the commencement of his sojourn at Marchmont House he had seized with avidity on the idea of reading for himself by means of the raised characters; but he speedily found his mistake when he discovered that, besides the Bible, the library contained little but a selection of tracts, addressed to intellects barely on a par with that of an intelligent child of six years old. John Morton would have relished the society of the intelligent child, and found instruction and wholesome exercise in answering the eager questions of the fresh young mind. But the dismal lucubrations of these old minds aping puerility, thoroughly sickened him, and John quickly threw them by.
               It is bad enough for a person of cultivated intellect to have his readings controlled in any way, but when this control is exercised by the narrowest bigotry, it becomes utterly intolerable.
               It was only his anxiety respecting his brother that induced John Morton, as I must continue to call him, to remain so long at Marchmont House; for he found his residence there to be in no way advantageous, either as regarded his pecuniary profits, or his intellectual culture.
               One night he dreamed he saw his mother, of whose face he retained a perfect recollection, standing ing by his bedside. She gazed on him, as he had last seen her, with her large loving eyes, and said in solemn tones, "My son, arise, and return to the home of thy youth. Thou wilt meet a friend on the way."
               He awoke with the voice still ringing in his ears, and the impression of the vision so strongly imprinted on his imagination, that for a few moments he almost believed that the sense of sight had been restored to him.
               Again he slept, and again the vision appeared to him, and uttered the words that had roused him from his former sleep.
               Once more the singular dream was repeated; and now so vividly that he resolved without hesitation to obey the behest so mysteriously conveyed to him, He found it no easy task, however, to put this determination into practice. Mr. Simpson, without making any formal objections to his departure, interposed so many obstacles to it, probably in the hope of deterring him altogether, by wearying him out, that it was several days before John took a final leave of Marchmont House.
               It is needless to say that he confided to no one the singular dream which had impelled him to return to Tattleton. In the first place, he held the name of his mother as too sacred to be bandied about in the coarse raillery which would be used to make him abandon his project; and secondly he shrewdly suspected that Mr. Simpson would not hesitate to make out a case of lunacy against him, rather than suffer so profitable an inmate to leave his house. As it was, he had to act with great caution in order to avoid such a catastrophe, and he entertained strong misgivings that two strangers, who were introduced to him by Mr. Simpson on the day after he first announced his intention of quitting the establishment, were no other than two "mad doctors," called in to give—if their consciences would permit them—a certificate of his insanity.
               If it were so, however, that and all other devices failed before the power of John Morton's calm, strong will; and one fine morning in July, he found himself with a small sum of money and a very moderate stock of delicate little baskets, fairly on his dark and lonely march back to Tattleton.
               It was a formidable undertaking to walk, blind and alone, over a hundred and fifty miles of unknown 
                     conntry
                     country
                  . But his heart was light, and his courage was high; and though in quitting London, he broke off all connection with his brother—for he carefully abstained from leaving any clue to his future movements—the process of gradual alienation had been so long in existence that there was scarcely a pang left for the final parting.
               He left Marchmont House shortly after daybreak, so as to be able to traverse the noisy and tumultuous city during a period of comparative calm. The young man whom he had employed to read to him had volunteered to accompany him for a few miles, and this assistance he gladly accepted cepted, for the solitude of a moor or a forest would have been easier to traverse than the labyrinth of the London streets.
               It was still early when, after breakfasting together at a little wayside inn, his guide parted from him on the great high-road leading westward. For the next few hours he felt very lonely; but the farther he receded from the metropolis the more kindly aid he received from the people with whom he came in contact. Sometimes a pedestrian, going the same way, would take him by the arm, and lead him along at a much faster pace than he could accomplish with the help of the slender hazel wand with which when alone he felt the ground before him. Sometimes a little child's hand would be placed in his to guide him safely over a cross road, or past a brook; and gentle childish prattle would beguile the tedium of a weary half-hour.
               No one could pass him by without remarking his tall, well proportioned figure, his dignified bearing, and singularly handsome face. The goodness of his dress forbade the offer of pecuniary aid; but many a lady stopped him to ask, apologetically, if those beautiful little baskets were for sale. The result was invariably a purchase; and when, as often happened, the remark was made, that he was "surely charging too low a price for them"—which remark he always set down as an offer of charity in a delicate disguise, when it was far more probably a tribute to the extreme beauty of which he was utterly unconscious he consistently replied that the price he asked was their fair market value, and he would take no more.
               If afterwards the fair Samaritan volunteered to lead him a while on his road, he might have observed, had he been able to see, that this seldom occurred in the midst of a town or village, or where she was likely to have the curious eyes of any friends upon her movements, but in some secluded lane or by-road, by following which, with her kind guidance, he might avoid a mile or so of the hot and dusty highway.
               At night he sought out a homely lodging, stipulating only for cleanliness; and then, if a supply of materials could be obtained, he renewed his stock of baskets; or if there were a demand for them, he remained in the place for a few days, and worked at his old trade.
               During the whole of this journey, which, at the outset, had promised to be so dull and wearisome, he enjoyed a sense of contentment that surprised himself. It might have been wholly due to the feeling of recovered freedom, for rules and restraints had crept upon him so gradually at Marchmont House, that at length his sojourn there had become little short of an imprisonment; but he subsequently attributed it to that mental exaltation which, with some persons, is a forerunner of great good fortune, and with others of the most terrible disasters.
               Which it was to be in John Morton's case, will be seen hereafter.
               Owing to frequent interruptions, deviations from the direct route, and his necessarily slow rate of travelling, it was nearly three weeks after his departure from London before John Morton found himself within eight miles of Tattleton. The familiar country dialect fell, like the voice of an old friend, upon his ear; the familiar names of places brought up reminiscences of childhood; the very air seemed to bring to him the odors of flowers that he had loved and gathered in his youth. And yet now, for the first time, his spirits sank—his heart failed him, and he began to ask himself why he was returning to Tattleton? Had he not left it a disgraced and suspected man? Might he not still be pointed at as the murderer of his poor old friend? And what had impelled him to return? A dream!
               It was not yet too late to turn aside, and continue his wanderings elsewhere. But then he thought of his dog—the only creature that truly loved him. He must go on to Tattleton to find Lion, and then he would roam away, he cared not whither.
               There was one inducement besides; he was anxious, if possible, to ascertain, the fate of little Bessie.
               At first, his habitual reliance on his brother's probity, had stifled any doubts that arose respecting the truth of William's account of her parentage. Later events, however, by gradually undermining that implicit faith, had permitted his doubts to spring up again; and by reflecting carefully upon every trifling incident connected with her that he had treasured up in his memory, he arrived at a tolerably clear conviction, that if Bessie were placed, as he feared she was, in the care of some poor cottager, a very grievous wrong had been committed.
               But how to rectify that wrong?—How even to discover the child?—As these questions arose in his mind, he felt the full amount of his misfortune in being blind and poor. He had no eyes to find the little creature, and no money to pay for other eyes to seek her.
               These thoughts pressed heavily upon him as he walked along beneath the scorching rays of the August sun. The atmosphere felt oppressive and though he went from one side of the road to the other, he could find no shade. There was not a breath of air stirring, otherwise he could have known to a certainty, not only whether he was in the neighborhood of trees, but what kind of trees they were, from the sound of the wind among the branches. He stood still, and listened. He heard the hum of insects, but not reverberating from any object near at hand, as it would be if he were close to a tree, a hedge, or a rock. The grasshoppers chirped loud, and their noise faded away into the distance. He imagined that he must be in the midst of an extensive moor. There were no odors
                     hat
                     that
                   told of cultivated land around. The rich, warm 
                     oma
                     aroma
                   of the corn-field was wanting, and the delicious scents from the fresh grass after the hay has been carried. In place of these came the perfumes of the gorse, the heather, and the wild thyme, mingled with the turfy, marshy smell of uncultivated ground. The larks were singing overhead, but they sing everywhere, and the voices of other birds were missing, except the monotonous note of the chiff-chaff, and the occasional twitter of the swallow. At length the melancholy cry of the peewit came to him from a distance, and then he knew that he was right in his conjecture. He was alone on a wild moor, of what extent he could form no conjecture, as it was more than an hour since he had encountered a human being.
               The feeling of intense loneliness and desolation deepened upon him, accompanied by a weakness and lassitude, such as he had never before, experienced. He groped his way to the side of the road, and sat down upon a low bank, quite resigned to the death which seemed rapidly approaching. His strength was gone; the buoyant spirit which had hitherto sustained him was entirely dissipated; even his ideas became confused; he thought he was still at Marchmont House, and that his journey was merely a feverish dream. The smell of the wild herbage on which he reclined recalled him to himself, and to the consciousness of an intolerable thirst that tormented him. He sat up and listened, hoping to catch the sound of a running brook, or of the step or voice of a fellow-creature. Nothing was audible but the gnats, the grasshoppers, and the peewits.
               We none of us feel quite resigned to die, and leave a work unfinished. If we have a debt to pay, or a good work to do, we cannot consent to let go our hold upon life without a struggle. So John Morton argued. He owed a duty both to Lion and to Bessie, and therefore, though he would have been content to die, as far as his own interest was concerned, he shouted as loud as he could for help. No human voice replied, but there was a faint bark of a dog, followed by a prolonged whine, and a rustling movement among the heather bushes.
               "Lion! Lion!" cried John Morton, starting to his feet.
               There was another feeble, but joyous bark, a nearer rustling among the bushes, and a gaunt, fleshless skeleton of a dog stumbled down the bank, and fell at his feet.
               The miserable condition of the poor animal was but too apparent, as his master passed his hand along his flank, where every rib stood out in horrible prominence.
               "Oh! Mother! Mother!" murmured poor John, as he clasped his faithful dog to his heart, and shed over him a flood of bitter teats—"you said I should meet a friend on my way, and I have indeed met my only friend!—It is best so! We will die here together, my faithful Lion! Better to die under. the free vault of heavens than in a close stifling room. Better to die with the one creature that loves me, than surrounded by indifferent strangers!"
               A partial oblivion fell over him, from which he was aroused by a violent shivering convulsion which passed through his body, and seemed even to be communicated to the dog. He was not left long in doubt as to the nature of this shock, for almost on the instant a tremendous peal of thunder rattled overhead, and then rolled away majestically into the distance.
               The electric disturbance did not, however, restore to the traveller his wonted strength. On the contrary, he felt more and more enfeebled, and when after a time, like the opening of gigantic flood-gates, the rain rushed forth from the over-charged clouds, he could only stretch his arms over his companion, and bow his head before the terrific storm.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               A PARTY OF PLEASURE.
               MISS MARIAN HARLEY created quite a sensation in Tattleton. Parties of all kinds were given in her honor and she, unfeignedly pleased with the kind receptions which she met with in every direction, was nothing loth to issue invitations in her turn. In fact she behaved like just what she was—a natural, unaffected, well-meaning girl, who, being excessively delighted at her good fortune, was determined to prove her gratitude by extracting from it the utmost possible amount of rational enjoyment, both for herself and others.
               Lucy Smith continued to improve rapidly in spirits and health, under Marian's fostering care. She was just now busily employed in making her wedding outfit, with the help of a seamstress from the village, an assistance which she was very reluctant to accept, as she felt already that her office of useful companion was useful to no one but herself.
               Marian had been very busy for several days, rummaging among the stores of Mrs. Martha Blake, from which, without in the slightest degree curtailing the liberal scale of her own establishment, she set aside a sufficiency of household linen, &c., to set up the moderate ménage of the parsonage very comfortably. She had talked over the old rector, and prevailed upon him to put the house into repair; and as soon as the painters and paper-hangers were gone, she was constantly calling Lucy away from her work, to accompany her in an invasion of the parsonage, to which she would forthwith proceed, followed by Sam, carrying a carpet, or a bundle of curtains, or some heavier article of furniture, which was always submitted to Lucy's approval with the stereotyped question, "Do you think that will do for the present, dear?"
               Marian must not be considered mean or stingy for thus furnishing her friend's house from the hoards of her own, instead of buying new articles, for she was not extremely rich, and she had an abundance of projects in her busy brain for the improvement and comfort of the poor cottagers on her little estate, which would demand more than all the ready money at her disposal, for their accomplishment. She explained this frankly to Mr. Hunter and Lucy, and finding that their delicacy would not be wounded by such a proceeding, she set to work, heart and soul, to make their new home comfortable with the least possible expense.
               It was about a week before the thunder-storm alluded to in the last chapter, that Marian hastily entered the little parlor beyond the library, which was exclusively devoted to the mysteries of millinery and dress-making, and summoned Lucy to perform the only duty of her situation that she ever exacted from her. This was to prevent her being left tête à tête with any of the aspiring bachelors, whose attentions unmistakably indicated what an American might call matrimonial proclivities.
               "Dr. McCorquodale is in the drawing-room, Lucy," she said, "will you go and talk to him till I come? Tell him I will be with him in five minutes."
               Within the specified time Marian was listening to his message, for he came as an ambassador from several families in Tattleton to solicit her cooperation in getting up a pic-nic to a point of great interest, situated about ten miles on the other side of the town. This was a lofty hill which commanded a magnificent prospect, and being crowned with an old beacon tower, of which the lower arch still remained in tolerable preservation, though long abandoned by any inhabitants, save bats and rats, it was a favorite site with pleasure parties, bent on playing at "roughing it."
               The Bowyers were going. They had engaged a large van, which would accommodate a fair sprinkling of gentlemen "unattached," besides their own numerous tribe of grown-up daughters. The Jarvises were going, and so were Mrs. Nettleship and Miss Sedgeley. Mr. Littleboy had surprised prised every one by the alacrity with which he had accepted the proposal that he should join the party; but nobody expected that he would be in time, especially as his aunt pleaded an unavoidable engagement, which would put it entirely out of her power to accompany him. Many other families were mentioned as being among the elect on this special occasion; but Dr. Mac did not once mention with which group his own lot was to be cast, and Marian plainly saw that he was fishing for a place in her basket-carriage.
               "I suppose," observed Marian, thoughtfully, "that each division will bring enough and to spare of eatables and drinkables for its own members, and then we can all reciprocate. My own party will be rather small. There will be Miss Smith, Mr. Hunter and myself. I can't bring Sam, because there'll be no room, as the hamper must be tied on the seat, besides which we shall have to stow things away in every available corner. Do you think you will be able to manage, my dear Lucy?"
               "I am certain I shall like whatever arrangement you make," replied Lucy, with a sweet, happy smile.
               "How often am I to tell you that flattery is strictly forbidden, you naughty girl!"
               "There is no flattery in that, I am sure. I merely meant that you always do make me comfortable, and that is only the simple truth."
               "I shall have but a small party of my own," continued Marian, "so I shall provide for the possible short-comings of the larger ones. By-the-bye, will there be any boys in the party?"
               "I am sorry to say that there will probably be six or seven of those pests of society," replied the doctor.
               "They may have been the pests of society a long time ago, when you were a boy," she replied, very quietly, "but the present race of boys are a glorious set. Take my devoted little lover, Harry Bowyer, for instance." 
               "Harry Bowyer!" exclaimed Dr. Mac, indignantly, "why he is one of the most audacious young scoundrels—one of the most insufferable puppies on the face of the earth!"
               "Oh, don't say so! Look what an idea he has already, of protecting and succoring the weaker vessel. See what care he takes of his little sisters."
               "That has only been since the young idiot fancied himself in love with you, Miss Harley. He used to plague them out of their lives."
               "And that shows the goodness of his disposition; and, in fact, the goodness of boy-nature altogether. He falls in love with one woman, and immediately his chivalric feelings are aroused towards the whole sex, inclusive of little sisters whom he used to tease, as a matter of course. I hope my young beau is going?"
               "I very much regret to say that he is," was the reply.
               "Then I shall take a good supply of fruit-pies and cakes, and a large jar of preserves. I believe that the dear boy's calf-love has a substantial foundation in plum-cake, and I don't want to trifle with his affections."
               "Then as you are so fond of catering for the tastes of the little boys," said Dr. Mac, with some asperity, "you will doubtless take a pigeon-pie to gratify your other Littleboy admirer."
               "Indeed I shall not. I don't like the Littleboys that are such in name only; and besides, there seems good reason to hope that his—what shall I call him?—His Eminence won't do, as he is not so very tall,—His Circumference! That's the word! There is reason to hope that His Circumference won't come. Can you imagine him leaving his aunt's apron-string? Suppose he should have one of his nervous attacks after dinner!"
               "I hope he will come," cried Dr. Mac, viciously, "and I hope he will have an attack after dinner! Won't I bleed him, that's all!"
               "I should recommend drenching him with cold water, only, as we shall have to carry our supply from the foot of the hill, it will be too valuable to waste. The bleeding will, after all, be the best plan, and I promise you that I, for one, will not attempt to interfere with your operation."
               "Were you not saying something about driving round by some wood, instead of passing through the town, Miss Harley?" suggested Lucy, to whom a quiet country drive was far more pleasant than the bustle of the town.
               
               "Oh, yes! Thank you, dear, for reminding me of it. And no one can direct me better than Dr. Mac, if he will favor me."
               "With the greatest pleasure," replied the gallant doctor, inwardly resolving to hire a saddle-horse, and meet her on the way. During the directions which he proceeded to give her, he more than once alluded to the ruins of the two cottages in the lane near the turnpike.
               "Can you tell me the history of those cottages, Doctor?" asked Marian. "Nobody seems to know much about them. Some say that a blind man murdered a woman there, and then set fire to the house. Others say that she was killed by a savage dog belonging to the blind man, and that he set the place on fire by accident. In fact I have heard so many variations on the story that I don't know whether to believe any of them. Only they all agree that a woman met with a violent death, and that a blind man and a dog were concerned in it. What is the correct version?"
               "You could not have asked any one, who was better qualified to furnish you with the full particulars," replied Dr. Mac, who was never more at home than when spinning a yarn, and he forthwith gave her a tolerably accurate account of those events with which the reader is already acquainted, with the addition of a few facts which have not been mentioned.
               "Then that poor man, Morton, actually fell under suspicion through his own compassion in not letting his dog worry the murderer!" said Marian, when the recital was ended; "he should at least have let him disable the monster, so that he could not make his escape."
               "You see, my dear lady, it was rather a nice point to decide. As the struggle took place at some distance, and the man was blind, he could not easily put a stop to it just at the moment when disabling was satisfactorily secured, while enough of life was left to be humanely nursed up for the gallows. Besides, every human instinct revolts at the idea of a fellow-creature being torn to pieces by a powerful brute."
               "All my instincts and sympathies would have been enlisted on the side of the brute, as you call him," said Marian, warmly; "and my only anxiety would have been lest the dear sagacious creature should be killed. What became of him?"
               "When the two brothers left Tattleton, they could not conveniently take him with them, so they sold him to Mr. Jarvis, and he has kept him as a yard-dog."
               "It is odd that I have never seen such a creature as you describe, though I have often been to the house."
               "You would not be likely to see him, for he is kept chained up in the backyard."
               "That is very cruel! I will ask Mr. Jarvis to sell him to me. He would be such a protection in this lonely house. And what was there about a child who was with the murdered woman?"
               
               "I heard nothing about a child," replied the doctor, "and I think that must have been a bit of pure invention on the part of your informant."
               "Very likely. But is it not strange that so many various accounts, should be circulated concerning an event which happened so short a time ago?"
               "If you had heard the rumors that were current only the day after," said Dr. McCorquodale, laughing, "you would rather be disposed to wonder how they had become so toned down and harmonized."
               "I must have that dog," said Marian, thoughtfully; "John Morton has sunk immensely in my estimation since I knew that he sold him. It was like selling a friend."
               "Oh! don't blame John for that," was the reply. "I don't think he knew anything of the sale. That was his brother's doing. John meant to leave him in Jarvis's care only; but William was a cute coon, and would never lose a chance of putting money into his pocket, so he sold him outright, for a sixth of his value."
               "What a detestable character!" cried Marian. "I can't rest till I have undone the mischief he inflicted on that noble creature. Lucy, love, you want some fresh air, and you want some more of that mauve silk. Put on your bonnet, and order the chaise, and then, if Dr. McCorquodale will take a seat with us, we will ask him to go first, and negotiate the matter with Mr. Jarvis."
               Dr. Mac was of course only too happy; such an arrangement being, in fact, precisely what he most desired, with the single exception of the company of Miss Lucy Smith. However, even as it was, he flattered himself that he had made great progress in the good graces of the heiress.
               Marian and her young friend did their shopping, and on their return met the doctor coming to meet them. His message was decisive. Mr. Jarvis would have been inexpressibly gratified to have begged Miss Harley's acceptance of the dog, but unfortunately, about a fortnight before, he had slipped his collar, leaped over a wall, and run away.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               THE PICNIC.
               THE day fixed upon for the picnic arrived. The sky was an arch of intense blue, without a single cloud—such a sky as is rarely seen in England. The party from Upton Manor set off early, that they might take their time on the road and yet reach the place of rendezvous before the sun's head became oppressive.
               Marian knew nothing about love from her own experience, but her genial, sympathetic nature rendered her an inimitable companion for a pair of lovers. She made occupations for herself, so as to leave them many a pleasant tête à tête.
               The place of meeting was at the miller's cottage near the foot of the hill, where the party would have to take in a supply of water, none being obtainable at the summit; but as, after waiting a while, there were no signs of any other arrivals, Marian and her friends left a message for the rest, and slowly climbed the steep ascent. This was a very agreeable portion of the journey. Marian and Mr. Hunter walked; but Lucy, not being considered strong enough to brave the fatigue, was ordered to remain in the chaise. She looked rather dissatisfied at first; but When Marian asked the curate to walk behind the chaise, and by leaning against the back to render a little assistance to the poneys, Miss Lucy appeared quite reconciled to her fate, and chatted comfortably in low tones, sitting sideways so that she could see the handsome happy face that bent forwards close to her shoulder.
               And Marian was as happy as they when she glanced back at the bright eyes and beaming faces which, but a few weeks before, were so haggard and hopeless, and reflected that the change was due to herself.
               "Oh! what a lovely world this is!" exclaimed Marian, enthusiastically, as she gained the brow of the hill, and beheld the magnificent prospect that spread before her.
               The lovers joined her in admiration of the scene, and while they were vying with each other in their enraptured laudations, the muffled sound of a horse's hoofs on the dry turf was heard, and Dr. McCorquodale rode up on a stout, short-legged cob.
               "For the love of fun, Miss Harley, turn round and look who's coming up the hill outside of a big baste of a horse! But, for your life, don't laugh out; or you'll spoil the sport entirely!"
               They all turned quickly round, and soon perceived ceived the object which had so excited the mirth of Dr. Mac. Riding rather in advance of the carriages, on a tall, large boned, white horse, was Mr. Littleboy, looking dreadfully fatigued, and perspiring profusely.
               "Did ye ever see such a sight now?" cried the mischief-loving Doctor, enjoying the efforts made by the three friends to restrain their laughter—"and isn't it worth coming a hundred miles to see? And however he was got on to the top of that animal is a puzzle to me. It couldn't have been by the usual method! He couldn't perform such a feat to save his life!"
               "Don't you think that, perhaps, they hoisted him up with a crane," said Miss Lucy, "and then let him down gently upon the horse?"
               "Oh! Lucy! who would expect you to be so malicious?" exclaimed Marian.
               "Be the powers then! but Miss Lucy must be right! And however will we get him up again when he's going home? I know! he'll have to walk down to the mill, and then we'll crane him up with the crane they hoist up the sacks with!. Oh! don't I wish it may be strong enough, and not break down when he's just at the highest!"
               "If it is to give way," observed Mr. Hunter, demurely, "I trust it may not be just when the poor horse is below, for he would certainly have his back broken."
               There was another burst of suppressed merriment, which was hastily checked, as the train of vehicles began to arrive on the level space on the summit of the hill.
               From the box of the foremost sprang Harry Bowyer; and rushing up to Marian, he begged to relieve her of the care of her poneys, and as soon as he got hold of the reins he grinned triumphantly at Dr. Mac, whom he had anticipated in this act of gallantry.
               Marian took advantage of the liberty thus acquired, to receive and return the greetings of her numerous acquaintances, and to hear their various comments on the weather.
               "Well, Miss Harley!" exclaimed a jolly old gentleman, who did not seem to mind the heat at all, though his round fat face was glowing like a hot coal, "what do you think of this weather? Couldn't have had a finer day if we'd bespoke it a month ago! I can't help thinking you must have a hand in it. Are you going to be like the queen, and always bring your own weather when you take an outing?"
               "I won't own to having anything to do with the weather, lest I should get into disgrace," was Marian's answer; "do you not know that the barometer was falling rapidly this morning?"
               "No; I did not even dream of looking at it in such weather. But it will hardly bring any change to-day, I think:" and he scanned the horizon carefully.
               Poor Mr. Littleboy had, with some difficulty, discounted; and leaving his horse to the care of anybody who choose to take charge of it, he sank down, completely exhausted, in an angle formed by the wall of the tower and a buttress, and was begging, in a plaintive voice, for a glass of pale ale, or anything, to save him from fainting.
               Three or four servants, acting under the orders of some of the married ladies, were making preparations for dinner, and one of them would doubtless find time to supply his wants; so Marian, instead of obeying her first good-natured impulse, and opening her hamper to find a bottle of ale for the unfortunate glutton, left him to his fate, and hurried away to carry out a little project of her own. She knew very well that she might reckon confidently on the attendance of two of her admirers, Dr. Mac and Harry Bowyer. And she was pretty certain also that poor Miss Sedgeley would be hanging about, in the hope of securing the attendance of the gallant Doctor; and this was precisely what Marian determined she should have.
               Passing her arm familiarly thorough Miss Sedgeley's, therefore, and taking no notice of the two expectant beaux, she begged that lady to conduct her to a pretty little dell that she had once described to her.
               "Oh, yes! I shall be delighted!" exclaimed Miss Sedgeley, hanging back a little, however, notwithstanding her profession of delight, in the hope of being joined by Dr. Mac. But Marian gently propelled her onwards, at the same moment, bringing Harry to her side by an inviting smile. The enterprising doctor would not be distanced in the race for a lady's favor by a mere boy; and the place of honor being already seized upon by that young scamp, whose ears he would have had much satisfaction in pulling, he was compelled to content himself with walking by the side of Miss Sedgeley.
               As they descended the dell, the path gradually narrowed until it was only wide enough for two persons to walk abreast. This offered just the opportunity that Marian wanted. She withdrew her arm from Miss Sedgeley's, and quietly consigning her to the escort of Dr. Mac, she walked on with Harry Bowyer, who strutted like a young peacock, with delight and pride at the preference she showed him.
               "Come on!" he whispered, "we'll get over the stepping-stones, and leave those old fogies in the lurch."
               "Hush! Hush! Harry, you must not speak so disrespectfully of your mamma's friends. Are these the stepping-stones?" asked Marian. "What a pretty place!"
               "Yes, isn't it pretty?" responded Harry, staring up into her face. "And now it will always seem twice as pretty as it used to do, because I shall always fancy I see you standing there, and peeping among the trees, and looking so lovely!"
               "My dear Harry," said Marian gravely, "if you waste all these pretty compliments in your youth upon a lady almost old enough to be your mother, what will you have left to say to your partners, when you go out to parties and dances, and when you will be looked upon as very stupid, unless you do talk nonsense?"
               "Ah!" sighed Harry, with a mortified air, "I see that you don't understand me, Miss Harley or else you won't. Can you venture to cross the brook by these stones? I'll wade through the water, and give you my hand to help you."
               "Stop, you silly boy!" she exclaimed, holding him back as he was about to step into the shallow stream, "you will get your feet wet through, and may take your death of cold."
               "I should not mind that,—I should like to die; or at least have a dreadful illness through doing something for you, for then you would be obliged to believe that I am in earnest, when I say how fond I am of you."
               "At all events, then, let the sacrifice be made for something like an equivalent. For see, I can go over these stepping-stones quite easily, without any help."
               And she tripped lightly over them.
               They had hardly crossed the brook before a singular sound appeared to fill all the air above them. It was something between a bell and a drum.
               "That's the gong to call stragglers in to dinner," called out Dr. Mac, from the other side of the ravine. "We had better hasten back with all speed. It was to sound half an hour before dinner is ready, but we must not forget who is sitting there in the corner; I assure you I saw him eyeing your hamper with an expression that made me shudder. if we don't make haste.
               Marian allowed the pair who seemed to be getting on so well, to proceed a little way before she skipped across the brook and followed up the winding path, in company with her boy-lover.
               "It's all very well," said the lad, for old Mac to laugh at that awful glutton, Littleboy; but except him, I don't know anybody who is fonder of good living, so he need not be quite so hard upon him."
               "And who is fond of plum-cake and fruit-pies?" said Marian, slyly.
               "Ah! yes! I own I am fond of sweets; I like them, but I love you, Marian!"
               "What! Transgressing again! What did I tell you?"
               "I can't help it! I dream of you as Marian, and I talk to myself about you all day, as Marian. So I can't help calling you so sometimes."
               The tears stood in his eyes as he said this, so she forgave him, and engaged him in a race to the tower, to give a wholesome diversion to his feelings.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               THE STORM.
               IT is needless to relate all the minor circumstances that surrounded the grand event of the day—the dinner,—the essence of the picnic.
               It is needless to tell how successfully the Miss Bowyers carried on their respective flirtations; or how fortunate they were in being posted within the circle of the funny man of the party—(there is always a funny man who comes out strong on these free-and-easy occasions,)—neither is it requisite to say how Dr. McCorquodale, adroitly exiled from Marian's immediate vicinity, and finding his Irish blood stimulated by the good things before him, the wine he had drunk, and the mirth and good humor around, fell into a still stronger phase of flirtation with Miss Sedgeley, who began to look quite charming under the inspiring consciousness that she still retained the power to please.
               I will also leave to the reader's imagination the enormous quantities of food and drink that Mr. Littleboy consumed. He was the first to begin, had eaten voraciously all dinner-time, and was still engaged with unabated vigor in the only pursuit in which he ever showed anything approaching to alacrity, when Mr. Bowyer, happening to look up, was struck by the appearance of a mountain of dark cloud that was slowly accumulating on the south-western horizon.
               "Those clouds look rather threatening," he remarked. "I'm afraid we shall have a shower before night."
               "A shower before night!" repeated Dr. Mac, whose experience of atmospherical changes was tolerably extensive; "we shall have a thunder-storm in less than half an hour more likely. Look at those follows coming up from the opposite side too! When those two armies meet, as they probably will, just over our heads, we shall see what we shall see. If I might venture a piece of advice, I would say 'pack up with all speed, and be in marching order before the storm begins.' Hark! There's the first warning!"
               As he spoke, a distant rumbling of thunder was heard, and all the ladies sprang to their feet in alarm.
               Lucy Smith did not start up with the rest, but she looked anxiously at her lover, and he returned the look with ten-fold solicitude.
               "Don't be uneasy about Lucy," said Marian's cheering voice, "when I saw how fast the barometer was falling, I put a waterproof cloak into the basket, to protect her in case of a shower. But I hope I may be able to make an exchange with somebody, and get her packed into one of the covered vehicles."
               The exchange was made in a way that she little anticipated or desired.
               Some of the ladies were really terrified at the prospect of the approaching storm. Some few—and they were but a few—pretended a terror that they did not feel, in order to appear interesting. More, though frightened, retained sufficient self-command to be useful. Among the latter was Miss Sedgeley, who, pale as death, and nervously starting at every flash of lightning, or distant peal of thunder, gave willing and efficient aid wherever it was wanted, waited upon meanwhile by Dr. Mac, in whose estimation she rose more rapidly than the mercury had sunk in the barometer.
               But though the ladies were frightened, and some of them screamed and pretended to go into hysterics, their wildest efforts were surpassed by the abject terror of poor Mr. Littleboy. His pasty face assumed a greenish tinge, his thick pendulous lips trembled with agitation, his large vacant, blue eyes stared helplessly around, and tears rolled down his fat cheeks.
               "I must get home to my aunt," he gasped out in wavering accents, "somebody must take me! I can't go alone! And I can't go on horseback."
               "Will you take a seat in our carriage, Mr. Littleboy?" said a manœuvring mamma, who would have been willing to sacrifice her plain daughter to this disgusting creature, for the sake of the small property he already possessed, and his expectations from his wealthy aunt. "We can take you into the town, and then you can hire a fly on to Petherton."
               "Oh! no! no! That won't do at all!" cried the fat egotist, without a word of thanks for the offer. "I can't be left alone! Somebody must take me to my aunt! Oh, dear! how I regret having come!"
               Mrs. Smyth turned away, with a reflection that after all, it might be better for Anna Maria to marry young Price, though he was but a poor surgeon, with a practice of only three hundred a year.
               "Miss Harley!" whined Mr. Littleboy, catching the skirt of Marian's dress as she hurried past, for he was still seated on the ground—"Oh! my dear Miss Harley, will you take me home to my aunt!"
               Marian paused, irresolute for a moment. Her lip and nostril showed the most profound contempt, and Harry Bowyer, whose eyes scarcely ever left her, fully expected to see her spurn the pusillanimous animal with the indignant little foot that tapped the ground impatiently; suddenly a pleased expression dispelled the scorn, and a mischievous light twinkled in her eyes.
               "Can any one arrange to accommodate my two friends, Miss Smith and Mr. Hunter?" she asked, in a loud clear voice, "and then I can take Mr. Littleboy home to his aunt. Can you manage it, Mrs. Bowyer? Harry will, I am sure, oblige me by riding the white horse, which can be left at the livery stables."
               Mrs. Bowyer and Harry instantly agreed, while every form of risibility, from a suppressed titter to an uproarious laugh, arose from the whole party. Mr. Hunter alone objected.
               "Indeed, Miss Harley," said he, "I cannot let you do this. You must trust your ponies to my charge. I am not unused to driving, and will be careful of them."
               "I shall take no harm," she replied; "in fact I shall be better off than if Lucy were with me, as I shall have the water-proof. Don't you see my object?" she added in a low tone; "the creature's absurd pretensions will be put a stop to for ever; and besides, I shall enjoy the fun. You must remain with Lucy. In her weak state the storm affects her more than she likes to own, and she would fret during the whole time you were absent."
               "Shall we take your hamper, Miss Harley? That would lighten your load a little," said Mrs. Smyth.
               "Thank you, but it will be wanted to trim my chaise, or rather to help to do so."
               "May I ride beside you, Miss Harley?" asked Harry, "then I can leave Mr. Littleboy's horse at Petherton, and return with you, in your pony carriage. Do let me, will you?"
               "No, my dear boy."
               "Well, then, Mr. Littleboy, it is decided, you see, that I can take you home to your aunt," said Marian, turning towards her interesting protégé. But he was no longer there. As soon as he found that matters had taken the right turn,—that Miss Smith was to go back with Mrs. Bowyer's party, and that Marian or Mr. Hunter (he cared not which) was going to drive him straight home, he immediately made his way to Marian's little chaise, in order to settle himself therein with the greatest regard to his own personal comfort. The ponies were already harnessed, and the hamper secured on the front seat, when Marian, escorted by Mr. Hunter and one or two others, went to take her place.
               "He's wrapped himself up in your water-proof cloak," said Harry, indignantly, "shall I pull it off him?"
               "No; leave him to me," she replied. "I will trouble you for that cloak, Mr. Littleboy."
               "But what am I to do? I shall be wet through, I shall take my death of cold."
               "I am sorry for that," she replied, very calmly, and repressing the overflowing anger of her companions by a movement of her hands; "nevertheless, as your dress is much thicker than mine—as I have twice the distance to go, and as I am going that additional distance to serve you, I must trouble you for my cloak. Some people might also insist that I am 'the weaker vessel,' but I confess I should be sorry to be weaker than you are."
               "Allow me to assist you, sir," said Mr. Hunter, looking pale with anger, as the porpoise slowly bestirred himself, grumbling all the time at the prospect of getting a wetting. "Remember that every moment that you lose now will expose you so much the longer to the rain when it comes in earnest."
               He pulled away the object of contention rather roughly, wrapped Marian carefully in it, and made everything snug on her side, including her little dog, which nestled safely at her feet, leaving poor Littleboy to shift for himself. Harry then gave her the reins and whip, squeezing her fingers tenderly as he did so, and uttering a fervent aspiration that she might reach home without any accident.
               "Can't anybody lend me a coat?" was Mr. Littleboy's last exclamation, as the ponies, refreshed by their rest, started off at a brisk pace.
               "Don't you wish you may get it?" shouted Harry. But he was not heard, for he was shouting against a peal of thunder that rattled right overhead. That was the signal for every person to hurry, for the rain began to fall in large drops that promised a drenching to whoso might be exposed to its tender mercies.
               Mr. Hunter hastened to Lucy, whom he found anxiously guarding the place beside her in the large van which conveyed the Bowyers' party. The awning was new, and promised to resist the pelting of the tempest, and the occupants were disposed to make themselves as comfortable, and to pack as closely as possible.
               Marian proceeded in silence. Her ungracious companion had twisted himself into a strange attitude, half crouching at the bottom of the little carriage. She was inconvenienced by this arrangement, but uttered no remonstrance.
               By the time they arrived at Miss Grimshaw's abode, Mr. Littleboy was thoroughly soaked, though Marian, thanks to Mackintosh & Co., was dry and comfortable. As she drove up to the entrance, the sound of the wheels brought the servants and Miss Grimshaw to the door.
               "Oh! What is amiss with my dear Theodore?" exclaimed the anxious relative. "What is it? Is he hurt? Is he ill?"
               "Oh! What's amiss with Master?" echoed all the servants, in chorus.
               "Nothing at all," said Marian, curtly. "He is only frightened, so I have brought him home to his aunt. Help him out, will you? I have no desire to remain longer than necessary in such weather."
               "Aunt!" cried Mr. Littleboy, feebly, as the servants began to help him to descend, "I am sure I have taken my death. I am quite wet through to the skin. Let me go to bed in hot blankets, and have some hot brandy-and-water. And we we're interrupted in the middle of dinner, too, and I'm quite faint for want of food. Have you anything ready?"
               "Yes, my dear boy, there is some mock-turtle soup, and"—
               
               But the moment his feet touched the ground, Marian shook the reins, and off went the spirited little animals, as though glad to be released from their burden. Miss Grimshaw had been so deeply engrossed by her sweet nephew, that she had not bestowed a word upon Marian. Mr. Littleboy had been so engrossed by his wet coat and his craving—it could not be his empty—stomach, that he had not vouchsafed one word of thanks to her for bringing him home. They had neither of them cast a thought upon her, nor inquired into her condition, nor offered her shelter, which she would not have accepted had it been pressed upon her; so she left them also without a word, and was past the gate before Miss Grimshaw recollected her existence. It was then too late to recall her, or to remedy their outrageous breach of politeness and hospitality; and the gentle Theodore upbraided his aunt with neglecting him, when she spoke of sending a servant after Marian.
               "She is quite able to take care of herself," he said, sulkily; "she is wrapped up in a Mackintosh cloak that she took from me, the greedy, selfish creature! If I had had it I should not be in this state—wet through, and dying, very likely. Let me have some soup immediately.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               THE MEETING ON THE MOOR.
               MARIAN'S first feeling, as she left Miss Grimshaw's gate, was one of unmitigated disgust and indignation. But the elements of the ludicrous were too strong and too numerous in the poor woman's overweening affection for such a worthless, and to all impartial minds, such a disgusting object, and in her nephew's hog-like selfishness and greed, for her to retain towards them for any length of time a serious sentiment. She began to laugh, "and indignation, however just, cannot survive much laughter."
               The storm, meanwhile, increased in violence; and as by the change in her route the rain no longer beat upon her face, she had leisure to admire the splendid effects produced by the various colored lightning.
               After proceeding for two or three miles, the face of the country entirely changed. She quitted the rich pastures and luxuriant woodlands, and found herself on swelling heaths, without a tree, or a vestige of cultivation. The road, however, was good, and though more than ever exposed to the wind and rain, she held fearlessly on her way.
               She was near the middle of the moor, which was about three miles in extent, and was going along with her head bowed, as the wind was now blowing fiercely upon her right side, when her little dog became suddenly excited, pushing his head out from his sheltered nook, and whining eagerly. At the same moment she heard a man's voice calling out, a few steps behind her—
               "Stop! stop! for a moment, whoever you are," he said; and even in that moment of excitement, she was struck by the depth, power, and pathos of his tones. "And if you are a Christian—if you are human—give me some assistance! I do not ask it for myself—I can walk—I can brave the storm. I ask it for my dog, my only friend, who is dying of hunger. They have starved him! And I am blind, and cannot help him."
               His voice broke down with emotion, and he bent his head over the poor gaunt dog that feebly licked his hand.
               Marian had stopped her ponies at the first cry of distress. She now backed them to the spot where John Morton sat, endeavoring to shelter his noble dog from the pelting storm.
               "And you too look quite exhausted," she said, gazing at them with deep interest. It was indeed a group to rivet the attention, and to remain impressed upon the memory for years.
               "I care not for myself," replied John Morton, catching hope from the sympathetic tones of her voice, "it is only for my poor dog that I ask help. He may yet be saved, if he, is housed and fed."
               "He shall be fed this moment, exclaimed Marian, alighting in the mud. Unfastening the hamper, she quickly extracted a piece of beef, which she cut into bits, that Lion might not choke himself. "Lion! Lion! Poor doggie! Good doggie," she said. "Isn't your name Lion?—He is eating it! He has eaten it all! And perhaps he had better not have any more till we get home."
               "Do you know the dog, Ma'am?" asked John, astonished to hear her call him by his name.
               "Only from description, and I wanted to buy him of Mr. Jarvis, but he had run away a fortnight before. Come, Lion! Get up! Oh dear! dear! He can hardly stand! Poor fellow! Will you feel the carriage, Mr. Morton, so that you may know how to help him in. It's a little low basket, so there will not be much difficulty; and there is plenty of room for you both."
               "You overwhelm me," said John, in a low voice, "but may I ask"—
               "No—ask nothing till we are out of this storm," replied the imperious young lady. "There that's it. Help him in, while I hold the 
                     pony's
                     poneys'
                   heads. I'm afraid of their beings startled by the lightning. Now get in yourself."
               "No—no,—I only asked help for Lion," replied John, bestowing a farewell kiss on the noble creature's head.
               
               "You appealed to me as a Christian," she said, sternly, "would it be the act of a Christian, or even of a civilized heathen, to leave a fellow-creature alone on this bleak heath in such a storm, especially when that fellow-creature has lost his sight? Oh! get in, Mr. Morton!—It is an outrage on my feelings to suppose me capable of leaving you behind."
               Without another word of objection John got into the carriage; Marian resumed her seat, and off they started. Little Rover, the spaniel, was already cuddling close to the large dog, as though trying to impart some of his own warmth to the nearly dying creature. Marian occasionally fed the invalid with a small piece of meat, which he received with a look of gratitude, and a languid wag of his tail. In the meanwhile she related to her fellow-traveller how it happened that she was out alone in such a storm with that providential supply of eatables; and then she took the opportunity of asking him if he would take some refreshment.
               He had been very silent during the drive, and the faint voice in which he declined her offer, caused her to look searchingly at him.
               "You are ill!" she exclaimed, "tell me what it is? What have you been doing?"
               "It is nothing," he replied; "my head feels strange and confused, that is all. Perhaps it is from not being accustomed to the motion of a carriage."
               "It cannot be that alone. Have you fasted too long? Will you have a sandwich? There are some ready cut in the hamper."
               "No, thank you, dear lady, I cannot eat. It is a dizziness that will soon pass away."
               "I don't think it will," said Marian, searching in the hamper once more, and bringing out a bottle and a tumbler, "I believe that you are fainting. Drink this."
               The wine revived him, and in another half hour she drove into the yard at Upton.
               "Is Miss Smith come home?" was her first question.
               Hunter and Dr. McCorquodale returned with her.
               "Dr. McCorquodale! How fortunate! Sam, help this gentleman to alight, and then take that dog out very gently. Lay him on a soft rug before the kitchen fire, feed him carefully, and rub him dry. Now, Mrs. Farncombe," she continued to the housekeeper, who appeared in open-mouthed astonishment, "please let a bed be got ready immediately for Mr. Morton. At least, ask Dr. McCorquodale to come out first, and give us his opinion."
               John Morton was by this time seated in the hall. He appeared almost unconscious, and could scarcely move.
               "Lauks! Missy dearie!" whispered Mrs. Farncombe, drawing Marian aside, after taking a careful survey of him, "don't 'ee keep him here, for your life! Send him on to the Hospital—he's took wi' the fever, as sure as sartain."
               "If he is, that is all the greater reason why I should not send him farther. Let him have the blue room. It is quiet and cool, and far from other people's apartments. Oh! here's the doctor. What do you think of him? Had he not better go to bed immediately?"
               "Awkward! Very awkward!" said Dr. Mac, drawing her aside. "He ought to be sent to the Hospital, and yet the additional exposure might cost him his life. Yet you must send him, I fear. It is I fear a bad case of typhus."
               "Mrs. Farncombe, have the blue room got ready at once. The doctor says it would be fatal to remove him. And you, my dear sir, will you show Sam how to assist him up stairs? Mr. Hunter would do it in a moment, but he would not understand such a matter so well as you. And besides that," she added, mentally, "no one who goes near Lucy shall come near him."
               Under Dr. Mac's directions, therefore, and with his help, John Morton was placed in bed. The doctor then sought out Miss Harley, whom he found in the library, talking across the width of the hall with Lucy and her lover, and making arrangements for establishing a regular cordon sanitaire between her and the sick-chamber.
               "We will consult Dr. Mac about it," were the words that fell upon his ear as he entered.
               "Here he is, ready to be consulted to any extent tent," said the doctor, "provided Miss Smith will bribe him with a cup of that delicious tea. And I also wish to consult you, Miss Harley, respecting our patient up stairs."
               "We will have our say first, then," said Marian, "Is this fever infectious?"
               "Humph! Well—yes; I should say so, decidedly."
               "Would you advise me to send Miss Lucy away? To the seaside, for instance?"
               "No," he replied, catching Lucy's anxious glance. "Miss Lucy would be far more likely to make herself ill with anxiety about friends who remained within reach of the danger, than to catch the fever by continuing in this house, if she takes proper precautions."
               "Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Doctor. That is just what I feel," said Lucy, gratefully.
               "You must promise to attend to all the doctor's instructions about taking precautions, then; and I will let you remain. And how about the servants, Doctor? Shall I keep them in ignorance of the infectious nature of the complaint, or tell them of it, and let those go away who are afraid of it?"
               "Keep them in ignorance, by all means, for if one took fright and bolted, all the rest would follow like a flock of sheep. Mrs. Farncombe knows it, but you must tell her to hold her tongue. Have you asked all your questions?"
               "Yes, I believe so. What was it that you had to say to me?"
               
               "Merely this. You know that I have retired from practice. I had a practice in Tattleton after I left the army, which I sold, and I am bound by the terms of the sale not to carry on my profession within a certain radius. But that does not hold good with respect to gratuitous patients. You are acting the part of a good Samaritan, very literally, by this poor fellow, John Morton, whom you found by the wayside, and have succored, and brought home; and I would do my part in attending him medically, if you feel disposed to place him in my hands. But I must explain to you that the Tattleton doctors and I would pursue two totally opposite modes of treatment. They would follow a lowering system, and starve, and possibly bleed him. I should treat him on the principle of regarding the fever as a lowering and exhausting disease, and should stimulate and strengthen him. Don't be afraid of giving me pain, or offence, by saying that you prefer to adhere to the old plan. But if you like the other—why, my services are freely at your disposal."
               "Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I must decide for him, poor fellow, and therefore I do so by accepting your offer, and begging you to commence his treatment without delay."
               Dr. Mac drank off two or three cups of scalding tea, and marched off, well pleased, to take possession of his patient.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               JOHN MORTON AWAKES TO A NEW LIFE.
               FOR three weeks the invalid lay between life and death.
               The doctor's assiduity was unremitting; Marian's solicitude was unwearied. Every hour in the day the hired nurse would suddenly find her standing by the bed, gazing compassionately on that noble head, that tossed in the restlessness of delirium upon the pillow. From his feverish ravings she learnt all the sad story of his past life. Now his first suspicion of his brother's probity tormented him; now the whole scene of the fire was acted over again in his busily working brain; sometimes he called upon Bessie to answer him—then came his expressions of delight when he found her unhurt. Sometimes he shouted to his dog to quit the murderer. In every utterance, however, he betrayed the existence of high feelings, and a cultivation of mind that seemed extraordinary in a man of his apparent station of life.
               Marian's visits to the sick-room were not confined fined to the day-time. Frequently during the night she would steal in with her noiseless footfall, ask a few questions of the night-nurse; render any assistance that might be needed; listen awhile to the patient's feverish mutterings, and then glide away again like a shadow.
               It was at the end of the third week of John Morton's illness. Marian stood at the foot of his bed, wrapped in a loose dressing-gown with her hair hanging about her shoulders. The third hour after midnight had just sounded.
               He was in a deep sleep, and breathing more calmly than he had done hitherto.
               "It is three o'clock," she said, in a low tone to the nurse, "you will not wake him to take his medicine, will you?"
               "Oh no, Miss," replied the woman; "sleep will do him more good than any physic. He is waking now, though, I think."
               As she spoke he opened his eyes, and seemed to stare about him. Then suddenly extended his arms towards Marian, and uttered the word, "Mother!"
               "In heaven's name! What does this mean?" cried Marian, springing to his side, and gazing into his eyes. "Nurse, see here, he is looking at me."
               "Mother!" he repeated, drawing her down towards him and kissing her. "Have you come for me, or has my life been all a dream, and am I still a child? No—no—my voice is that of a man, and I am dreaming now."
               "You are not dreaming," she said, soothingly, though her heart throbbed wildly with delightful expectations; "but tell me,—can you—can you—see me?"
               "Yes, I see you! But how is this? You cannot be my mother,—and your voice!—Oh! pardon me! you are the lady who befriended me in the storm, and I have been kissing you!"
               "Never mind—I forgive you. You took me for your mother."
               "Yes—she was young and beautiful when I lost my sight, and the last object I remember to have seen, was her face leaning over me, as you were doing. And you are young and beautiful, are you not?"
               "I am rather young, and not ill-looking, I believe," she replied, blushing deeply. "Nurse, will you give Mr. Morton his medicine?"
               "Will you tell me where I am?" he demanded.
               "You are in the house of a friend. Let that satisfy you."
               "Is it night or day?"
               "It is night now, and there is a candle burning behind the bed-curtain; but it will soon be day."
               "Was my dog Lion with me when you found me on the moor?—or was that all a dream? I have had so many dreams, and such strange ones, that the realities seem dreams, and the dreams realities. I thought he was nearly starved to death."
               "He is quite well now, and rapidly regaining his flesh."
               
               "Will you let me see him? I became blind during a fever, and if my sight should go again to-morrow, I should like to have looked on the only friend I had before I met with you, and the unknown owner of this house."
               "He'd better be kept quiet till to-morrow, Miss," interposed the nurse, "its no use for him to agitate hisself. He can see the dog in the morning."
               "He shall see him to-night," said Marian, going out of the room.
               The nurse was somewhat surprised that the patient did not begin to question her, as soon as the young lady was gone; but he lay perfectly still, only reaching out his hands from time to time, as though trying to touch the bed-posts, or some yet more distant object. He could not estimate the smallest distance by his eye.
               "There is Lion's step!" he exclaimed, long before the nurse heard any sound of his approach, "and that is the lady's. What a light, firm step she has!"
               No sooner did Lion become aware of his master's presence than he leaped upon the bed with every manifestation of the most unbounded delight.
               The nurse uttered a suppressed cry. She feared that the rough gambols of the great dog might injure her patient, though she did not dare to interfere with the lordly animal.
               "There! I knew how it would be!" she exclaimed, "he'll do him a damage, I know he will!"
               "Now I am satisfied," sighed John Morton, sinking back, quite exhausted. "Let him remain; he will not disturb me. Lie down, Lion."
               His eyes closed, and he fell again into a profound slumber. The dog, obedient to his slightest word, stretched himself on the carpet, and lay motionless. The nurse, having satisfied herself that the invalid was asleep, and not fainting, retired to her easy-chair. And Marian, after taking one lingering look at the closed eyes, and putting up a silent prayer that when they opened again, it might not be to a renewed eclipse, stole away on tiptoe to her own chamber.
               To her chamber,—but not to sleep. The gray dawn was already peeping through the window-blinds. She drew them up and let the sweet morning air blow freshly in through the open window. For a short time she sat, and watched the outlines of the cedars becoming more and more distinct against the brightening sky. Then she went to her toilette table, and mechanically combed out her long, silky hair.
               "Young and beautiful!" she murmured, "am I beautiful?—No! I cannot flatter myself that I am. Yet beauty lives in the eye of the beholder, rather than in the face itself; and he may—!!!! How strange that he should take me for his mother! How tenderly he kissed me!"
               She returned to the window, and dreamed away the hours till the servants began to stir, when she plunged into her bath, dressed in haste, and paid a visit to the sick-room.
               
               A calm and happy expression rested on the invalid's face. He had fallen asleep in the blissful consciousness of his recovered sight, and the thankful joy remained imprinted on his features.
               He was very pale, for the fever had tried him severely, notwithstanding Dr. McCorquodale's sustaining treatment. But how handsome he looked! How like he was, she thought, to the picture of the Last Sleep of Argyll! And when he woke, would he still retain his sight? She was so impatient to have this question answered, that she could almost have aroused him to satisfy herself.
               But he saved her the trouble. His eyelids unclosed, and his eyes remained fixed straight before him, as they had done during the period of his blindness. Marian uttered a low cry of despair, and bowed her face upon her hands.
               He turned at the cry, and smiled at her.
               "Ah! you can see, after all!" she exclaimed, "Oh! tell me—tell me you are not blind again!"
               "No! I thank Heaven! I have recovered my sight. And this is the morning! How beautiful! How strange everything seems! Is there not something in the window? I think I used to look out at the sky and trees."
               "There is a blind over it, but it had better remain so till the doctor comes. Too strong a light might be hurtful to you."
               "I will do all that you tell me," he replied, in a tone that said obedience to her was pleasure.
               "Then I will go and gather you some flowers. Come, Lion! come, and have your breakfast!"
               But, though he depressed his ears and gently wagged his tail, Lion declined to leave his master.
               "Oh! you naughty doggie!" she said, putting her arms round his neck, and laying her soft cheek on his great head, "and you have been such a good, obedient doggie all through your master's illness, and now you won't obey me!"
               "Go," said John Morton, and the docile creature followed Marian from the room.
               In ten minutes the young lady returned with a basket full of fresh flowers, which she spread upon the bed, and showed him, one by one, to see whether he could guess their names from their appearance. But this was impossible, and it was only by the smell that he could distinguish them. There was but one flower whose form he recollected since the days of his early childhood, and that was the simple wild daisy; the "wee, modest, crimson-tippit flower," beloved by Robert Burns.
               The nurse was sadly scandalized by these proceedings. The flowers were wet, and would give him cold. The smell of flowers was the most injurious thing possible in a sick-room; and she shouldn't wonder if he was thrown back altogether by such nonsense. Besides, what call had a grown man to play with flowers, like as if he was a child? It would be much more seemly for him to be returning thanks where thanks were due.
               These observations were not uttered aloud, but were mumbled for her own satisfaction, as she moved about, setting the room to rights, before the advent of her successor, the day-nurse.
               Great was the amazement and delight of this functionary when she learned what a marvellous change had taken place in her absence; and as she was a woman of more refinement and feeling than the other, she watched with tearful eyes the enjoyment of the hitherto blind man in making acquaintance with the external beauties of those delicate works of the Creator's hand, which he had known till now only by their perfume.
               Dr. Mac came earlier than usual, for he had predicted a crisis in the disease during the night, and was anxious to know which way it would turn. He was in ecstasies at the success of his treatment, and demonstrated to Marian, entirely to his own satisfaction, that if the depleting system, had been followed, the patient must not only have inevitably sunk under the exhaustion, but would never have recovered his eyesight.
               Marian was quite willing to believe in and corroborate everything he said; and though she knew but little about medicine, she devoutly believed Dr. Phineas McCorquodale to be the cleverest physician in the world.
               A month passed by, and John Morton was able to walk about the garden, and had even ventured as far as the parsonage. His strength was fast returning, but his mind was a prey to the most anxious reflections. With his recovered sight, a new existence opened before him. He was no longer content to weave baskets for a living. The stores of information which he had acquired while William employed him as a means of accomplishing his own education, might now be turned to advantage, and enable him to attain that worldly position for which he was fitted, and to which he know he had been born. But the difficulty was how to set about it, and even when he had a definite object in view, how should he find the means to make the first start? When he left London he had reduced his wardrobe to suit his intended mode of travelling, and that consisted of the outer clothes that he wore, and a single change of linen in a knapsack. The linen, under Marian's management, had multiplied to an amazing extent during his illness, and at an early stage of his convalescence he had bought a new suit of clothes, but the cost had nearly exhausted his slender resources.
               Marian had more than once hinted her desire to further his interests in any pursuit he might select; but he shrank from accepting pecuniary aid, especially from a woman. And how to do without it he could not tell, unless he resumed his old trade for a year or two, and acquired the accomplishments of reading and writing in the intervals of labor. He had already commenced those elementary studies under Mr. Hunter's guidance, and he now sat beneath one of the cedars, thoughtfully ruminating upon the future. He held a book in his hand, but his eyes were fixed upon Marian's favorite seat, a low, horizontal branch, just at its junction with the parent stem. He was debating within himself whether it might not be wiser in him to accept her assistance—which he knew he had but to ask for to obtain—and thus place himself in a position to raise himself, and repay her at an early date, rather than waste some of the best years of his life upon a lowly mechanical employment, which, with the closest economy, would barely enable him to lay by a meagre sum. Yet again the question arose, "What occupation should he seek? What was he fit for?" He possessed considerable knowledge—he had energy and strength but his knowledge was useless for want of the simplest groundwork, and his strength and energy could effect nothing unless they were directed into a proper channel.
               While lost in this perplexing labyrinth of thought, the parting of the branches roused him, and Marian entered the tent of verdure, with a letter in her hand.
               "I want you to give me some advice, Mr. Morton," she said, seating herself on her usual branch. "I have just received this letter from my lawyer, and I don't quite understand it. At least, I think there is some other motive beside the one that is stated."
               "Very likely, or lawyers are much belied."
               "I'll read it to you—'My dear Miss Harley: A client of mine has just purchased some land in the parish of Combe St. Nicholas, for the purpose of building a house. His land lies contiguous to that small parcel of waste ground belonging to you, situate in the same parish, and known as Stoney Acres. This land, you are probably aware, is so poor as not to pay for cultivation; but my client thinks he might utilize it for the erection of farm buildings, &c., and as he offers a fair price for it—indeed far beyond its market value—I would advise you to close with it at once. Awaiting the favor of your reply'—and so on. What do you think of it?"
               "What is his name?" demanded John Morton, with startling energy. "How is the letter signed?"
               "William M. Fitzgerald."
               "Fitzgerald," he repeated in a tone of disappointment, "that is not the name I expected to hear. Will you read the letter once more?"
               Marian complied, and he listened with his eyes closed, as he always did when he wished to pay particular attention to any subject, preferring to trust in the old tried senses, to the exclusion of the new-found one, which even yet at times led him astray.
               "It is very strange," he said, musingly, "there is something in that letter which sounds almost like my brother's voice speaking to me. You are aware, I dare say, that I have a brother, Miss Harley?"
               "Oh yes! I know it. I had heard of him before I saw you; and then you talked about him very often during the time when you were delirious with fever."
               "Did I talk of him?" he said, sadly. "Will you tell me what I said?"
               "That would be rather difficult. Sometimes you imagined yourself in the days of your boyhood, and you were carrying him about on your back. And then you referred to later times, and talked of business. You mentioned also a little girl called Bessie, and very often you spoke about Lion, and called to him. Good old Lion!" she continued, caressing the dog, who was of course with his master.
               "But about my brother, Miss Harley—what else did I say of him?"
               "There was one incident that you dwelt on constantly. You imagined yourself to be carrying your brother somewhere, to fetch little Bessie. But I could not understand that at all, for you seemed to think you were both grown-up, and why should you carry your brother, when he was no longer a little child?"
               "He was lame," replied John, "paralyzed in his legs from birth."
               "Oh, good heavens!" she exclaimed, turning pale, "and you said this letter reminded you of your brother! The lawyer's name, I recollect, is William Morton Fitzgerald! Is it possible that they can be the same?"
               "I fear they are," he replied.
               "Why fear? He is wealthy and prosperous."
               "It is precisely that which is the worst part of the business. Yet it may not be he, after all. Is that lawyer lame?"
               "Yes. He moves about in a chair on wheels."
               "It is he! There is no hope of a mistake."
               "Why should you regret his good fortune? When he knows where you are, will he not be rejoiced at your having regained your sight, and will he not gladly aid you to advance in the world? You will accept his assistance," she added reproachfully, "though you repel the offers of other friends, even before they have the courage to utter them."
               "I do not regret William's good fortune; but I regret the means by which, I fear, he must have attained it. As for knowing where I am," he said, with an expression half of sorrow and half of bitterness, "he knew where I was all the time that I remained in that dreary asylum. Then for my restoration from blindness,—Heaven forgive me if I am wrong in believing that the news would fill him with consternation and regret. He would not offer to advance my interests in life, but rather would endeavor to crush me. And were he to propose it, I would die, beg, rob on the highway, before I would accept from him the fraction of a farthing. Do not think me proud, dear lady, because I have hitherto eluded your delicately-hinted proposals to lend me some assistance in whatever career I may find open to me. I had resolved, just before you came here with that fatal letter, to speak to you candidly about the future, and to ask your advice, and, if necessary, your assistance. The discovery we have now made, strengthens me in that resolution; but it likewise renders necessary a fuller statement of, facts than I had previously contemplated. It necessitates, I greatly fear, the exposure of a brother's faults. Such an explanation cannot be lightly made; yet I am bound in honor to have no concealments from one whose advice and help I solicit. I must think it all over before I decide on what I am to do. Oh! that that letter had never come! How selfish I am, Miss Harley! In my own anxiety I have completely overlooked the subject on which you came to speak to me. I am grieved to say that the discovery of the writer of that letter being William Morton, makes it doubly imperative on you to proceed with caution. Have you seen the land he mentions?"
               "No, I have not. I understood that it was only a bit of barren ground, without even a cottage on it, and I had, in fact, forgotten its existence."
               "Then my advice is, that you visit it as soon as possible, and take a surveyor with you—not a mere professional surveyor, but one who understands something of geology."
               "How shall I find one?" she exclaimed. "I don't think there is a geologist in Tattleton."
               "Depend upon it, Dr. McCorquodale will help you out of the difficulty. He knows everybody, and everybody's accomplishments, and if there be a competent man within twenty miles of Tattleton, be will find him for you. There may be some mineral wealth under the stony ground, which this client is desirous of purchasing at a nominal price."
               "I hear a carriage coming along the road," said Marian; "that may be Dr. Mac through he generally rides or walks when the weather is fine. No, it is Miss Grimshaw and her lovely nephew. I have never seen them since the day of the picnic. What a bore! But I suppose I must go to them."
               Reluctantly she left the lovely arbor, and the society of a man of intellect and sympathy, to pay the penalty of being a lady of property, in playing the agreeable to stupidity and selfishness.
               John Morton, tormented by his own thoughts, wandered away into the quiet of the churchyard.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               A CURIOUS PROPOSAL.
               WHEN Marian entered the drawing-room, she found Miss Grimshaw sitting very upright in a high chair according to her custom; but what struck her with absolute amazement was to see Mr. Littleboy sitting at a short distance from her in another high chair. On every occasion on which she had hitherto had the felicity of studying the habits of this lovely youth, she had always found him, occupying the most luxurious easy-chair or sofa in the room.
               The thought instantly glanced through her mind that he had had an attack of apoplexy, and the doctors had ordered him to avoid falling asleep at unseasonable hours. She little suspected that it was an artifice of Miss Grimshaw's, that he might be able to rise and make an elaborate bow when the mistress of the house entered the room, and also that he might keep awake during the conversation that was to take place in the course of the visit.
               After some preliminary skirmishing about the weather and the country gossip, and just as Marian was in hopes they were about to depart, Miss Grimshaw opened her batteries.
               "And now, my dear Miss Harley," she said, after clearing her throat and casting a side-glance at her nephew, to see that he was on the alert,—"and now, I must inform you that we have come here to-day with an especial object."
               "Yes," mumbled Mr. Littleboy, "special object."
               "I am fully aware," continued the maiden aunt, "that, in negotiations of this nature, it is usual for the party principally concerned, to speak for himself. But my dear nephew is an exception to the general rule."
               "Yes," mumbled the nephew, "'ception to general rule."
               "Oh! Miss Grimshaw," said Marian, with suppressed mirth, "it requires, no great amount of reasoning to convince me that Mr. Littleboy is an exception to almost every general rule."
               "I am indeed delighted to find that you are able to appreciate him, Miss Harley. It is a proof of your discernment and penetration, for my darling Theodore is so extremely modest and reserved that he never makes the most of his advantages."
               "I really don't deserve to be praised for any especial powers of discernment, Miss Grimshaw. Every young lady in Tattleton holds precisely the same opinion of Mr. Littleboy's merits that I do. You should have heard what they said about him after the picnic. By-the-by, Mr. Littleboy, I have not seen you since. Have you quite got over your fright at the thunder-storm, and also your wetting? I was sorry to be obliged to take my Mackintosh from you, but as I had only a muslin dress on, of course I should have been saturated in a moment, whereas your cloth coat and the horse rug could resist the rain."
               "Don't mention it, Miss Harley," replied the amiable Theodore, with perfect gravity; "there was some disregard manifested to my personal safety and convenience, but I have overlooked all that. Pray never mention the subject again."
               "Are you serious?" demanded Marian, utterly aghast at his placid impertinence.
               "Upon my honor I am," he replied, with ten-fold benignity; "I was never more in earnest in my life."
               Marian was struck dumb by his amazing assurance. She sat, staring at him in silence, for she knew that if she spoke, she must laugh. Miss Grimshaw seized the opportunity to renew the attack.
               "As I said before, Miss Harley, my nephew should, according to custom, have come alone on this important mission, but he is so modest and so reserved, that he felt he had not sufficient nerve to go through with it. It is, as I hinted before, a mission of the most vital importance."
               "Vital importance," mumbled the corpulent echo.
               "Miss Grimshaw!" exclaimed Marian, who began to entertain some unpleasant suspicions respecting the nature of this mission, "I think I can guess what it is you have come, to request of me; and I only wonder that you should consider so much beating about the bush to be at all requisite for so simple a request. You want one of my sucking pigs! I can only say that you are perfectly welcome to it. And now come out into the yard, and choose which it shall be."
               She rose as she concluded, and moved invitingly towards the door; but Miss Grimshaw retained her seat with a look of offended dignity, and her nephew puffed out his fat cheeks till his watery blue eyes were scarcely visible.
               "You are mistaken, Miss Harley," said Miss Grimshaw, with a patronizing air, "it was about an important family matter that we came to speak. Was it not so, Theodore?"
               "Yes—important family matter."
               "I cannot possibly guess what it may be," said Marian, more than ever convinced that she was correct in her first surmise concerning the errand these two fools had come upon, "therefore I must trouble you to speak out plainly."
               "As you are a woman of sense, Miss Harley, I will do so. Although I must say, I had expected to find that your penetration and good feeling would have induced you to meet me half-way."
               "Oh, you horrid old egotist!" thought Marian; but she did not move a muscle of her face, and sat motionless, with her eyes fixed upon Miss Grimshaw.
               "I should not have accompanied my nephew on the present occasion, Miss Harley, had he not particularly requested it, because he is so highly sensitive and nervous that he feared he should not be able to give utterance to his sentiments."
               She paused. Marian acknowledged the termination of the period by a slight inclination, and then resumed her former rigidity of face and figure.
               Miss Grimshaw coughed and looked at her nephew. Mr. Littleboy coughed and looked at his aunt. Marian was delighted to see that she had thrown then both into a state of uncomfortable embarrassment, and intensified her expression of attention to the old lady's communication.
               "I assure you Miss Harley," continued Miss Grimshaw, "that I undertook this office with very great reluctance."
               "Great reluctance," grunted Mr. Littleboy, like an asthmatical echo.
               "It is a subject at once of so much delicacy, and of so much importance," continued Miss Grimshaw, becoming more and more confused, "that I—that I—really, Miss Harley, I think you might understand me without further explanation."
               "I can see," said Marian, with an air of charming candor, "that it is some favor that you wish to ask of me, and which you think it likely that I should be reluctant to concede. Therefore it must be something that I value highly—something most probably about the farm—is it the pedigree wheat?" she asked with an air of triumph.
               "Oh! Miss Harley!" exclaimed Miss Grimshaw, reproachfully, while Mr. Littleboy groaned out, "Pedigree wheat, indeed!"
               "I am quite at a loss, then, and must throw myself on your mercy for an explanation," said Marian, blandly, and relapsed into the condition of an attentive statue.
               "I have long wished to see my nephew married, but hitherto I have failed to meet with a lady who came up to my ideas of what his wife ought to be."
               "Ah! now I perceive your drift!" exclaimed Marian; "you wish to ask my advice, which you shall have with much pleasure. In the first place, in such a connection, there should be a similarity of tastes. And here at once a formidable obstacle presents itself. It will be so very difficult to meet with a lady who participates, even in a remote degree, in your nephew's excessive devotion to the good things of the table! There should also be a strong mutual appreciation, and a correspondence between the tastes of the one and the accomplishments of the other. Now Mr. Littleboy would esteem no qualification in a wife equal to that of being a first-rate cook. Therefore in your search for a suitable connection, the cookery must be the main point kept in view."
               "A woman ought to be able to manage her house," grumbled Mr. Littleboy.
               
               "Really, Miss Harley," said his aunt, "you appear to misunderstand me purposely."
               "As I am so unfortunate in my endeavors to understand you, Miss Grimshaw," said Marian, "I will not attempt it again."
               And she relapsed into immobility.
               "To return then to the point where you interrupted me," resumed the aunt, with some asperity. "As Theodore desires to rely, to a great extent, upon my judgment in his selection of a partner for life, I have looked about me carefully for some years past, but have never met with a lady whom I considered anything like an eligible match until now—that is, quite recently."
               She paused, but Marian was relentlessly silent.
               "And now, as we have both agreed in our choice, he wishes me to support him by my presence, and to prepare the way for his proposal."
               By a slight inclination of the head, Marian acknowledged that she had heard, while the blank expression of her face showed that she by no means understood the drift of this statement.
               "Ahem!" coughed Miss Grimshaw, casting a sidelong glance at her nephew. "Are you prepared to speak, Theodore?"
               "Why, no, Aunt," he replied, "I don't feel equal to the exertion. I had rather you would go on. You can explain it better than I can."
               Marian felt the hot blood mounting to her face, but she preserved her outward calmness of manner, and suppressed her ebullient indignation.
               "To come to the point at once then, Miss Harley," continued Miss Grimshaw, with the air of one who conceived herself to be conferring a favor, "my nephew, with my entire concurrence, has decided upon offering to you the position of his wife."
               For a few seconds Marian preserved silence. She knew not whether to laugh or be indignant. The temptation to ridicule was powerful, but her own dignity forbade its indulgence. An exhibition of anger against such a pair of unmitigated idiots would lay her open to ridicule, and that was equally distasteful to the haughty young damsel. Subduing both feelings therefore to a matter-of-fact coolness, and self-possessed, business-like air, she prepared to receive Miss Grimshaw on her own grounds, and fight her with her own weapons.
               "Your treating this affair so completely in the light of a mere business transaction," she began, "possesses the undeniable advantage of setting wholly on one side all those questions of feeling and sentiment which are apt to render such discussions somewhat embarrassing. I can now talk to you with as much ease and indifference, as though the subject of the proposed bargain were something much more commonplace than my hand, my fortune, and my future happiness. In the first place, then, as I have already said, Mr. Littleboy requires some peculiar qualifications in the person he marries. She must be an excellent cook before dinner, in order to minister to his predominant taste; and she must be an experienced nurse after dinner, in order to avert the threatened attacks of apoplexy, consequent upon over-eating. I do not consider myself fitted to be either a cook or a nurse. I should, it is true, be able to take care of him during a thunder-storm; but I must candidly confess that in circumstances of more imminent peril, I should prefer a husband who could take care of me. Therefore, all things considered, Miss Grimshaw, I beg to decline the honor of the proposed alliance."
               "What's that? What's that?" exclaimed Mr. Littleboy, staring in blank dismay from one to the other, "she doesn't refuse me, does she?"
               "I do, sir, decidedly," replied the young lady.
               "Pray, Miss Harley," interposed the aunt, "take time to consider."
               "It is quite needless. The matter does not require one moment's consideration."
               "Let me tell you, Miss Harley," cried Miss Grimshaw, waxing wroth, "that you will not often have such a young man as my nephew at your feet."
               "Heaven forbid that he should kneel at my feet!" said Marian, laughing; "I should certainly be obliged to call in two men to help him up again. And then imagine how ridiculous I should look!"
               "You appear to me to think of nothing but yourself!" said Miss Grimshaw in high dudgeon; "come, Theodore, we will not intrude our unwelcome company any longer upon Miss Harley."
               "Are we really going?" whispered the porpoise. "Won't she ask us to lunch? I feel quite faint!"
               "You must wait till we get to the inn," replied his aunt. "We could not accept her hospitality, even if she offered it. Good-day to you, Miss Harley."
               And she swept out of the room.
               "Good-day," grunted her nephew, as he waddled after.
               Marian watched their departure with flashing eyes, and heaving bosom.
               The attempt to secure her property as a means of pampering the gluttony of that disgusting animal, Theodore Littleboy, was too apparent to be ignored, and she felt proportionately indignant.
               "What can have happened?" exclaimed Lucy Smith, running into the drawing-room,—a very different creature from the poor wan girl who had arrived only three months before—"the whole house is in a commotion, Miss Harley! Mr. Littleboy has gone away without eating anything!"
               "And I hope he will never come back again, the hateful creature!" cried Marian. "Only imagine, Lucy! He came here with his aunt to ask"—
               But here the ludicrous aspect of the affair struck her so forcibly that she burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. After a little while she recovered herself sufficiently to enact the whole scene, with dramatic effects, for the amusement of her friend.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXX.
               JOHN MORTON'S DISCOVERY.
               AFTER Marian had left him, John Morton wandered into the churchyard, full of painful reflections concerning his brother.
               The prattle of childish voices broke upon his reverie. A group of children were gathering daisies, and chattering as they wove them into chains.
               "Oh! look here, Bessie!" cried one little voice, "here's such a beautiful one! All pink round the edge! I'll give it to you."
               "No, dear; keep it yourself," said another little voice, "I can gather plenty of pretty ones too. I'm sure some very good person must be buried in this grave, for there are such lots of pretty daisies on it—much prettier than there are on the other graves."
               "What a singular idea to enter the head of a peasant child!" thought John, "or indeed of any child! And what a remarkable voice she has! It is like a voice that I have heard in a dream."
               He did not stir from the flat stone on which he was sitting, nor make his presence known to the little people, lest he should check the innocent chatter which amused and interested him so much. But Lion walked round the tombstone which hid him from their sight, and put the whole troop to flight, excepting the little girl named Bessie, who clasped him round the neck, exclaiming, "Oh! it's Lion! Dear, good Lion! Do you remember me?"
               John followed the dog, but he had no recollection of the child who was caressing him. When she saw him, however, she started up, and putting her little hand into his, peered into his face, and said, "You have got your eyes now, Uncle John!—I'm so glad! Where did you get them from?"
               She was a pretty little girl of about five years old, with a certain air of refinement about her, which even his inexperienced eyes were able to discover.
               "Are you Bessie Lonsdale?" he asked.
               "Yes," she replied, "I used to be Bessie Lonsdale, but they call me Bessie Bell now. But I remember Lion, and I remember you too. You told me to call you Uncle John."
               "How strange that you should remember me so well," he said; "come hither, little lassie, and tell me if there is anything else that you recollect."
               "Oh, yes! I recollect a great deal. There was Mammy Palmer, who gave me oatmeal porridge and new milk for breakfast and there was a sailor man, and another horrid man, that Lion jumped at and tore his clothes."
               "Can you, indeed, recollect so much?" said John, "then the question is settled. If this child has been deprived of her rights, they must be asserted. Whatever may happen, justice must be done. And in the strict pursuit of justice, none can suffer who have not merited discomfiture. I see now that there is no half-measure that can be taken. The guilty cannot be spared without inflicting an injury upon the innocent. Stay," he continued, detaining the child as she was about to run away to her companions, "tell me where you live—who takes care of you?"
               "I live with Sally Bell, and she takes care of me. Now, may I go, sir, please?"
               He had purposely pulled her frock aside when he stopped her, so as to disclose the little anchor tattooed upon her shoulder.
               "Yes—you may go," he said, releasing her.
               He still sat sadly meditating on the painful duty that lay before him, when he was roused by a brisk step on the gravel path, and the curate came by, fresh and cheerful as a spring morning.
               "Good-day, Mr. Morton," he said. "I am glad to see you extending your wanderings a little. Will you come on to the parsonage? It is not so comfortable as it will be in a short time,—but what can a poor bachelor do?" And he smiled in anticipation of the comfort that was to reign there when Lucy "came home," until his eyes sparkled, and his white teeth gleamed in the sunshine. But observing no answering glow on John Morton's face, his gayety instantly vanished.
               "You seem out of sorts my friend," continued Mr. Hunter, "has anything untoward occurred?"
               "I am tired," replied John; "I have walked farther than I ought."
               "Then accept the support of my arm back to the house," said the curate, eagerly.
               This conduct was not quite disinterested, as it afforded him an opportunity of seeing Lucy, a pleasure which he had enjoyed only six times that day.
               Virtue, it is said, brings its own reward; and perhaps he thought so, when he found the tea-table spread beneath one of the cedars, and the two ladies waiting for them to partake of the social meal.
               "I told you so, Lucy!" exclaimed Marian, as they appeared, "I saw Mr. Hunter going towards the churchyard, and I was quite sure he would not leave Mr. Morton to come home alone. You have no idea, Mr. Hunter, of the difficulty I have to convince this girl what a practical Christian you are."
               "I must not take too much credit for the performance of any duty that brings me here," he replied, "for if all Christian duties were as pleasant, we should have no infidels."
               During tea, Marian was full of her arrangements for a visit to Combe St. Nicholas on the following morning; and it was concluded that the present party of four should proceed in the basket-carriage to the bit of land under discussion, and there meet a practical geologist whom Dr. McCorquodale had promised to send on from Tattleton.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               ANOTHER DISCOVERY.
               THE weather on the following day was propitious, and the little party set off after an early breakfast, accompanied by Lion, now completely restored to his usual strength, and three or four small dogs whom he delighted to patronize.
               Lucy Smith was quietly, though completely happy. The curate was in a state of radiant bliss. Marian was placidly contented and hopeful. John Morton alone was frequently overclouded by fits of gloom.
               When they arrived at the spot called Stoney Acres, John stayed awhile at the inn to see the ponies fed, while Marian walked on to where Dr. McCorquodale and another gentleman were super-intending the work of a couple of laborers who were digging a hole in the ground.
               "You were quite right to be cautious, and to ascertain the value of the bittock before you parted with it," said Dr. Mac, as he shook hands with Marian. "Mr. Ferguson finds strong evidence of the existence of coal not very far from the surface; and from all that we can discover, they are about as much digging the Suez Canal as they are excavating the foundations of a house on the adjoining land. Depend upon it, they have found coal there, and desired to get possession of this piece before you knew the value of it, that they might follow up the veins beneath it."
               "And could they not do so now if they wished it, without saying anything to me about it?" she asked.
               "Oh, no, my leddy," replied Mr. Ferguson, "if they excavated a single foot beyond your boundary, you could just tak the law of them."
               "I have no wish to indulge in that expensive luxury," responded Marian. "I would much prefer selling the land at a fair price, and having no farther risk or trouble about it."
               "Ah! but the law's a fine thing!" replied the Scotchman. "What would we do without it?"
               "We should be obliged to put up with a little justice and common-sense instead, I suppose," said the young lady, "and I really think they would do as well."
               Mr. Ferguson shook his head dubiously, and went across the ground to look at an old quarry examination of the debris with which it was littered. His mode of proceeding struck the Scotchman as being very remarkable. He picked up specimen after specimen, which he first looked at carefully, and then examined by the touch with his eyes closed. In the same way he inspected and, manipulated the strata that were exposed in the sides of the quarry.
               "Do you not expect to find coal here, Mr. Ferguson?" he demanded, hopefully, when he saw the latter standing on the edge of the excavation.
               "There's mair unlikely things than that," replied the canny Scot, descending, and joining in the investigation, "and I think, Mr. Morton, ye've just arrived at the correct induction, however ye came by your knowledge."
               "I was always fond of books on geology," said John, modestly, "and for some time I had the 
                     privlege
                     privilege
                   of examining, in my own way, a small, but very well arranged collection of specimens. I am very pleased to find that my limited information is correct as far as it goes."
               "Your limited information is nothing to complain of, man. It will help you on through the world yet. And so let us go and tell the young leddy what we have discovered. She's a sensible lassie, if she had not got some queer crochets in head."
               Marian was delighted at the news they brought, and agreed at once to Mr. Ferguson's suggestion, that men should be set to work without delay to ascertain whether the coal seam was near enough to the surface to be worked with advantage, and also what might: be the quality of the mineral.
               "I must engage some competent and trustworthy worthy person to superintend the, operations, Mr. Ferguson," she continued. "Can you recommend any one to me?"
               "I'm not free to specify at the moment," he replied, "but I'll just turn it over in my mind, and let you know before the day's out. And now I'm thinking, I'd just like to see what yon folks are doing on Littleboy's land. They keep their proceedings very quiet, but they can hardly turn me off the ground when I go to ask a civil question. However, I'll try the experiment."
               "Does that land belong to Mr. Littleboy?" asked Marian, in astonishment. "How very singular! Why should he want to buy my field, if"—
               "Ah! ah!" laughed the Scot, "just because he is the greediest kite in the country-side, and he thought he'd ha' the land, if he missed the lassie. Never blush about the matter, Miss Harley. The whole town knew it before you did; but there was no one on the parade that held your good sense so light as to bet a bawbee on his chances."
               As he went away, laughing at her confusion, the clatter of a pony's hoofs was heard, and Harry Bowyer trotted up.
               "Look, Miss Harley!" he exclaimed, with boyish glee, "look what a beautiful pony uncle Jack has given me! Her name is Jetty, though why they should call her so, when she's bright bay, and not jet black, I can't imagine. And she prances so beautifully when she comes out of the stable, you can't think! Now, isn't she a beauty?"
               
               "She is a very pretty creature, indeed, Harry," said Marian, patting the pony's neck, "and I hope you will be a good boy, and try to deserve the kindness of your uncle."
               "Oh!" cried Harry, flinging himself out of the saddle in disgust, "you know how I hate to be talked to in that way, as if I were a child! You may say anything in the world to me, darling Marian," he continued, squeezing her hand, and looking unutterable love; "I will take anything from you, provided you advise me like a man, and don't lecture me like a boy."
               "You forget my lessons too quickly, Master Harry. Have I not told you not to call me Marian?"
               "One comfort is that you wouldn't mind it, if you really thought me a child," said Master Harry, saucily, though his lips quivered, and a tear added an additional lustre to his dark blue eyes. He paused for a moment, kneading her hand nervously between his own, and struggling to suppress a sob that shook his young breast; then with an energy and passion that quite startled her, he added, "I hope that something dreadful will happen soon, and then you shall see how gladly I will lay down my life for you, and you will believe that I love you for yourself, like a man, and not like a baby, for the sweets and nice things you give me."
               He cast on her a glance of fierce and indignant remonstrance, and crossed the field to talk to John Morton. Of all the men who ever came near Marian, he was the only one who aroused no jealousy in the heart of this preposterous youth; and yet he was the only one towards whom such a feeling would not have been wholly groundless.
               Marian, half dismayed at the boy's impetuosity, sauntered away to meet Mr. Ferguson, whom she saw returning from his visit of observation.
               "It's just as we expected, Miss Harley—coal and of very fair quality. There's little doubt but we'll drop down upon the same seam in your land And now we're alone, I'll tell you my opinion about a supervisor for your works, which I could not do discreetly in Mr. Morton's presence. He's the very man that you want, and if I'm not much mistaken, he'll take the post willingly."
               "But what can he know of mineralogy," asked Marian, "he has been blind all his life, until about a month ago!"
               "He knows as much about mineralogy and geology as I do, if not more," said Mr. Ferguson; "he smelt out your coal deposit, all by himself. There he was, touching here and touching there, instead of looking like other folks. And 'I think,' says he, 'we'll find coal hereabouts.' And then he gave me his reasons as clear and accurate as I could have done myself, that have been staring and studying among the rocks for these twenty years. Take my word for it, Miss Harley, if you like to offer it, and he likes to take it, he's the very man to fill the post. And he's a conscientious lad, and will see that no wrong is done; besides which, he is an excellent mathematician, as many a blind man has been before him. You'll not find a better man for the work, and it will be but an act of Christian kindness and justice to lend him a hand to get quit of the basket-making business, which was all very well while he was blind, but which he should not be bound to, after he's got his sight."
               "I am quite astonished to hear of his acquirements, said Marian; "he has kept them so modestly in the background, that I did not even suspect their existence."
               "Ay—ay—the lad's a good lad, and deserves the best you can do for him."
               "What do you think of these, Mr. Ferguson?" asked Morton, coming up with his hat and pockets full of specimens, and his fine face beaming with pleasure, "would you not expect to find iron here as well as coal?"
               "Indeed I would," replied Mr. Ferguson, after examining the specimens with great attention; "and now, Miss Harley, don't you think you had better follow my advice?"
               "Certainly if Mr. Morton agrees to it."
               "It's just this then, Mr. Morton," said the Scot, answering the young man's inquiring glance, "Miss Harley must have some responsible party to manage these mining works for her, and I tell her she can't find a fitter person than yourself to do it."
               "Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be of use to Miss Harley," replied Morton, "and I am sure she would find no one more zealous in her service,—I only doubt my own abilities."
               "Your abilities are first-rate, man. It's only your modesty that stands in your way. There's a fortune ready to your hand, and you've nothing to do but to take it."
               "The wretch!" thought Marian, energetically.
               "Let me once see a good chance of some employment, and I'll worked my way to fortune before very long," said Morton, cheerfully, "I don't want that which I have not earned, fairly and honestly. Therefore, if you think that my attention to business can compensate for my want of experience, I will gladly take the appointment. There are a few questions that I should like to discuss with you in the first place, Mr. Ferguson, for I fear you have not fully taken into account the, extent to which my blindness has kept me ignorant."
               "Come along, then. There's no need to plague this young lady's ears with technicalities. We'll meet you at the inn, Miss Harley, where we can take a little creature-comfort, while the horses are got ready."
               "The creature-comfort is ordered to be ready by one o'clock precisely," she replied, as she walked away with her juvenile adorer, Harry Bowyer, "therefore be punctual. Now, Harry, we will go and explore that stream by the wood, that interested you so greatly."
               Harry was enchanted. For the first time he had Marian under his sole protection, and he fervently hoped that something would happen which would furnish an opportunity for displaying the heroic devotion with which his young heart was filled. He was naturally a brave boy, but to exalt himself in Marian's estimation he would have over-leaped the commonest dictates of prudence, and rushed headlong into danger.
               But the walk offered nothing better than an awkward stile where Harry could exhibit his gallantry. Yet it was a walk to be remembered, for he had her all to himself, as Marian purposely kept at a short distance from Lucy and her lover, and only joined them at the entrance to the village.
               They reached the inn precisely at one o'clock, expecting to find Mr. Ferguson and John Morton, but ten minutes more elapsed, and neither of them appeared. Then heavy steps were heard running up the village street.
               "There they come!" cried Marian, running to make up for lost time!"
               "No," said Harry, looking from the window, "it is two of the miners. How fast they are running!"
               "I'll give them five minutes more grace, and then, if they are not here, we will begin without them," said Marian, looking from Lucy to her watch; "in the meantime, Harry, will you ask, for a glass of nice home-brewed ale for Miss Smith. We cannot get any wine here, I find."
               Harry went out to the bar to execute this commission, there being no bell in the little old-fashioned sanded parlor, and when he returned, he looked very much excited.
               "There's a row up yonder," he exclaimed, seizing his hat, "and I'm going to see the fun. Lion has attacked one of the men, and those two came down to fetch the police."
               "The police can't be wanted to take Lion into custody," said Mr. Hunter, his master must have got into a difficulty on his account, more likely. I will go with you, Harry, if the ladies do not object to being left."
               "I should prefer to accompany you, Mr. Hunter," said Marian looking very pale. "Are you too much fatigued to come, Lucy?"
               "Excuse me, ladies," said the landlord, who entered with a glass of ale, "I hope you'll pardon the liberty, but you'd better not go. Jim Miller tells me that the dog has torn the man dreadfully, and I'm sure that won't be a sight for you to see."
               "What are the police wanted for?" asked pale Marian, trying to look firm. "Who are they going to arrest?"
               "Well, you see, ma'am, I don't quite know the right of it altogether, for Jim Miller and Joe Watson they only knew there had been an awful scrimmage, and that Mr. Morton's great dog had nearly throttled one of the mining hands, and they'd been sent to fetch the police and a stretcher. But as far as I can make it out, there's something to do about a murder that was committed some years ago, not far from Tattleton."
               "But who is it that is to be arrested?" persisted Marian.
               
               "Well, ma'am, as I take it, it's the man that's supposed to have committed the murder."
               "But what man is that?" she demanded, impatiently—almost fiercely.
               "Well, ma'am, as I take it, it must be the man as the dog has flew at," stammered the landlord, "because, you see, it stands to reason that he wouldn't fly at anybody else."
               "It stands to reason, I think, that you are a fool," muttered Marian, going to the window, and looking up the street. "Thank you, Mr. Tubbs," she continued to the bowing landlord, no doubt we shall soon hear the facts of the case."
               The plain facts of the case, when she came to hear them from John Morton himself, were simply these. Lion had attacked and nearly killed one of the workmen on Mr. Littleboy's pound, whom Mr. Morton had afterwards recognized by his voice as the tramp who had called at his cottage on the day of Mrs. Palmer's murder. These facts were sufficient to authorize him in giving the man into the safe-keeping of the police, and preferring against him a charge of murder.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               JOHN'S NEW POSITION.
               ON their way back, the whole party were occupied by serious and saddening thoughts, and proceeded in silence, till, in reply to a sudden question, John Morton gave them a detailed account of all that he knew respecting the murder. He did not once mention his brother, and when he was compelled, in the course of his narrative, to allude to Bessie, it was simply as the little girl whom Mrs. Palmer had to nurse.
               In the course of the afternoon a summons arrived for John Morton to attend and give his evidence before the magistrates.
               It is not my intention to go into all the particulars of the trial of Matthew Hutchins for the murder of Melicent Palmer. Suffice it to say that, although the evidence was almost entirely circumstantial, it was made out so conclusively that not a doubt remained upon any mind respecting his guilt, though every one felt more satisfied when they knew that the condemned criminal had confessed that he committed the crime for the sake of possessing himself of the little hoard, which he had heard the poor woman say she had laid by for her own funeral expenses.
               This occurred early in the winter.
               During the interval but few events of interest had happened.
               Lucy Smith had become Mrs. Hunter, and the parsonage house looked really bright and comfortable in the curate's eyes.
               John Morton took up his abode at Combe St. Nicholas, in order to be near the scene of his labor. He lived in the most economical manner, studying hard and saving up a fortune for Bessie. As soon as he could command a moderate sum of money, he had negotiated with Sally Bell respecting the removal of the child from her custody.
               That worthy woman had no scruples of conscience to contend with. She merely looked to the profit of the transaction. William's pay was not by any means liberal, and she had the constant trouble of maintaining the little girl. John offered her a sum that would enable her to emigrate to America. So she sent word to William that the child had died of whooping-cough, obtained from him a few pounds to bury her, which she added to her stock, and took her departure. Bessie was immediately placed, by her self-constituted guardian, at a good school. He had not yet decided how to. act respecting his brother, and had taken no one into his council; but in the meantime she was enjoying all the advantages of an education, befitting the rank to which he supposed her to belong.
               John Morton made no acquaintance beyond the family in which he lived as a boarder. This family consisted of an old half-pay officer, his equally aged wife, and one daughter, a young woman of about twenty.
               Becky Price was a pale thin girl. An ordinary impartial observer would have pronounced her to be chiefly conspicuous for her want of attractiveness; but woe be to the man whom circumstances placed at her mercy, for she was a perfect mistress of the art of wheedling. Her flatteries were incessant, yet unobtrusive. They never gave offence, at least to the hood-winked object of them, though all sensible women who saw through the manœuvres of the artful little serpent cordially detested her.
               Young as she was, she had already created several scandals.
               But for about a year the young lady had been doomed to pine in solitude and inactivity, till fortune sent John Morton to seek a home at Combe St. Nicholas, and fate bent his steps to her mother's door. He had inquired at the post-office for lodgings, and had been told that Mrs. Price, at Myrtle Cottage, had more rooms than she could occupy with her small family, and might be induced to take a "highly respectable party" as a boarder.
               When he was first installed in his new abode, Morton took very little notice of his landlady's daughter. He only saw an insignificant little person, with a figure like a thread-paper; a sallow, unwholesome looking skin; pale gray eyes scanty hair that seemed to have had the color washed out of it; large irregular teeth; and very weak, useless, inexpressive hands, of which, as they were small, long and slender, she was excessively vain.
               All this formed an ensemble that was not calculated to produce a strong or lasting impression at first sight; and John Morton left the tea-table and retired to his study without having his mathematical calculations interrupted by visions of little hands handing him cups of tea, or fluttering about the cake or bread and butter.
               In little more than a week he became conscious that some invisible fairy was constantly ministering to his comforts.
               The want of sight had made him extremely methodical in the arrangement of his tools, and whatever else belonged to him, and this habit clung to him still. In the first two or three mornings of his residence at Myrtle Cottage, the servant had reduced his belongings to a state of chaos, by her unenlightened attempts at setting them in order. He lodged a complaint, and for the future everything, though carefully dusted, was left in its place. There were other signs too, which he began to notice. The fire was always bright and the hearth freshly swept on his return from the works; and if the day was cold or rainy, his easy coat and slippers were placed ready for him, the lamp was lighted, and his pipe was filled.
               The daily and hourly ministration of these watchful cares rendered his new home very attractive, and in proportion as he felt it to be so, he remained there in the evenings, earnestly prosecuting his studies, instead of walking over to Upton, a distance of eight miles. He dined with Miss Harley every Sunday, as she had specially invited him to do; but his visits during the week gradually became less frequent, and at length ceased altogether.
               For a long time he attributed to Mrs. Price the assiduous cares of which he was the object, and when he expressed to her his thanks, her quiet rejoinder of "Indeed, Mr. Morton, you have nothing to thank me for," only confirmed him in that belief.
               It may appear singular that, as the good lady was very anxious for her daughter to catch her steady, industrious, money-making lodger for her husband, she did not at once inform him that Becky was the invisible fairy who ministered to all his comforts. But the young lady had requested her mother to leave the entire management to her, and Mrs. Price, having the fullest confidence, founded on ample experience in her daughter's powers of inveigling, implicitly obeyed.
               One miserable stormy evening, however, when John came in to tea, he had his right hand bound up, having met with an accident from the machinery nery. He made light of the injury, and only regretted that it would prevent his writing some letters of importance, adding, that at the best, calligraphy was a tedious process with him as yet. When the meal was over, and he was sitting in his own room, his pipe in his mouth, a book in his hand, and Lion stretched on the hearth-rug, a gentle tap at the door was followed by the appearance of Miss Becky, very neat, and very clean.
               "Mamma's compliments, Mr. Morton," she began, looking intensely modest and child-like, "and she says I am quite at your service to write your letters for you, if you don't object to my knowing what they are about."
               "You are very kind," he replied, "and if you can spare the time, I shall be extremely obliged to you for your assistance. I was just debating with myself whether I should try to write with my left hand, or send for the foreman, though the poor fellow would not much relish turning out again on such a night as this. Can you spare the time, do you think?"
               "Oh, yes! I have nothing particular to do, and it will give me great pleasure to help you, Mr. Morton."
               Without another word she arranged the writing materials, and sat down, pen in hand. She wrote rapidly and legibly, and John was surprised to find how speedily his correspondence was dispatched by her nimble fingers. He expressed his pleasure, and his thanks both together, very cordially.
               "Oh! then I hope you'll let me write for you again, Mr. Morton. I have so much time on my hands—in fact I have nothing to do, so you need never hesitate. It would be quite a kindness to employ me. It is so pleasant to feel that one is useful, even to such a small extent as that of writing a letter or two."
               "You are very good-natured to say so, Miss Price,"—
               "No! don't say that, Mr. Morton!" interrupted the gushing girl. "Indeed and indeed it is not mere saying! I feel that it is a pleasure."
               "Well, then, it is very good-natured of you to feel so much pleasure in conferring a favor on a comparative stranger," said he, smiling amiably on the artful little creature; "and as you will not permit me even so much as to impute a doubt of its being a delightful occupation for a young lady to write a lot of dry technical details which she cannot possibly understand, I will remind you of your offer if I have any more important letters to send off while my hand is useless; and perhaps sometimes afterwards, when anything has to be written in a hurry. I am a very slow penman yet, for, as you are probably aware, I have been blind for the greater part of my life."
               "How terrible that must have been!" cried Miss Sympathy, who had the whole story at her fingers' ends. "Shall I fill your pipe for you? You can't do it with only one hand."
               "Not on any account!—It is a sufficient tax upon you to endure the smell of the smoke, without letting you soil your hands with the tobacco."
               "Don't you know that I very often fill it?" she said, with a coquettish laugh.
               "Indeed!" he exclaimed, "is it to you then, that I am indebted for all the thoughtful cares which make me so very comfortable? You are too kind, Miss Becky!"
               "Don't mention such trifles! They're nothing—nothing at all!"
               She saw that she had made at last a strong and probably a lasting impression, which she would leave to do its work; so with an affectation of childish shamefacedness, she faltered out some broken sentences, and ran out of the room.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               HALLOW E'EN.
               ON that same evening Marian Harley sat alone in her favorite room, the library.
               A cheerful fire of logs blazed on the hearth, a bright lamp burned on the table, piles of books were around her, old books on the shelves and new books just released from Mudie's box, upon the table,—outside the house she could hear the ocean-like roar of the great cedars as they battled with the storm,—on the hearth-rug lay a comfortable group composed of two little dogs and two or three cats, making pillows of each other in the happiest fashion imaginable; there was everything that she used formerly to picture to herself as the ingredients of a comfortable home, and yet she felt neither comfortable nor happy.
               One volume after another she took up, and threw aside again. Books that she had longed to read had now lost their attraction. Old favorites had ceased to please. Only in the moody verses of Byron did she sometimes meet a tone which aroused an answering echo in her own heart. Yet this interest was but broken and fragmentary. 
                     
                        "Man's love is of man's life a thing apart;
                        'Tis woman's whole existence."
                     
                  
               
               On these lines she dwelt passionately, but the conclusion of the verse had no power to stir her.
               She arose and looked at herself in the glass, studying her own face.
               "I am not handsome," she said, "yet I am not ugly. And I don't generally look cross and disagreeable, as I do now. I know I am always cheerful and good-tempered when he is here, so I must look my best, without thinking about it. And yet he never seems to think me at all good-looking! He never watches me, as Mr. Hunter used to watch Lucy, as though his eyes would turn of themselves towards her, like a magnetic needle. Oh! what a fool I am! He never will love me, because he has got it into his dear, stupid, honorable head, that I am his superior. I was so happy at being rich, and now my riches stand in the way of my happiness! Perhaps, when the days grow longer and brighter, he will come over as he used to do. There is no young lady there to keep him at home, that is some comfort, though a poor one! No, there is no one there except Miss Becky Price, and certainly no man could fall in love with her!"
               Could she have known that Becky Price, having patiently watched and waited till a favorable opportunity presented itself, was at this very moment practising her juggleries on poor John's kind, grateful ful, unsuspecting nature,—though her feeling of desolation could scarcely have been greater, her anguish would have been keener.
               The usual group of idlers were assembled on the parade on the afternoon of the day in question, discussing small scraps of local gossip, while they awaited the coming of the station-master, who usually brought some interesting bits of information respecting the arrivals and departures of their neighbors.
               "Well!" he exclaimed, as he joined the group, "who do you think came down by the express this afternoon?"
               "Who?" cried several voices.
               "That's more than I should like to swear to," said the station-master, deliberately, "He came in his own carriage, with two highly respectable looking servants. The master lay back, wrapped in cloaks and furs, with his cap drawn down over his eyes. The carriage was to be moved off the track without disturbing him. He was lame—one of the servants said. But while our men were busy about it, there was an accidental jolt, which, I dare say, felt to him as if the carriage were just turning over. He called out and leaned forward, so that I heard his voice, and had a good view of his face."
               "Well!" cried a chorus of eager listeners, "and who was it?"
               "As I said before, I should not like to take an oath about it, but my firm belief is, that if ever I saw that lame young fellow who used to be clerk to Mr. Lonsdale in this town, I saw him this afternoon in that travelling carriage."
               "What! William Morton?" exclaimed Dr. McCorquodale. "Impossible! His brother came back six months ago, as poor as when he went away. Now it is well known that John supported William for many years, and enabled him to study the law, and article himself to Mr. Lonsdale. They left the town together; and I put it to you, gentlemen, as a question of common sense, is it likely that John would come back as poor as ever, if his brother were rich enough to travel in the style that our friend here talks about?"
               "My good sir," said Captain Clarke, "in the course of your experience did you never hear of a thing called ingratitude?"
               "To say that I have lived in this world, and not up aloft among the angels, is a sufficient answer to that question," replied Dr. Mac; "but hang it all, man, this would be something a long way beyond what could be called ingratitude! It would be positively I don't think there's a word in the language to express what it would be!"
               "Which way did your mysterious stranger drive, Mr. Clarke?" demanded one of the committee of inquiry.
               "Straight into the town. I wonder you did not see the carriage."
               "I did," said another; "it was going at a rapid pace down East street. Here comes Jarvis, perhaps he will know something about this stranger."
               "He's certain to do so, if it is William Morton."
               A regular broadside of questions opened upon the lawyer as he joined the gossiping fraternity; but he had no information to give them.
               He had neither seen nor heard of Mr. Lonsdale's quondam clerk since he left the town with his brother, nearly two years ago.
               As they seemed unlikely to make any further discoveries, the conclave separated.
               In the meantime the object of all this lively curiosity had arrived at Petherton Lodge, the residence of Miss Grimshaw and her nephew.
               Without the slightest fuss or confusion, of which he had the greatest horror, the traveller was lifted out of the carriage, placed on a wheel-chair, and propelled into a room on the ground floor, which had been fitted up as a bed-room.
               When his elaborate toilette was completed, the head valet, without asking for orders, pushed the chair into the drawing-room; while the junior threw open the doors, and prompted Miss Grimshaw's awkward young country lad to announce—"Muster Fitz-jurrel—Mum!"
               Mr. Fitzgerald possessed the art of making his greatest calamity appear graceful, and his intelligent valet acted so completely in unison with him that his locomotion seemed like an act of volition.
               When the lawyer entered Miss Grimshaw's drawing-room, even the stolid Mr. Littleboy was struck by the graceful ease of his manners.
               He had come on business of great importance, but no one could have supposed that he had any other object in view than the pleasure of enjoying the company in which he found himself.
               The dinner was excellent. Even he, a professed epicure, found it so; but the marvel of the entertainment was, that Mr. Littleboy contrived so far to restrain his appetite as to be capable of holding a rational conversation afterwards.
               When Miss Grimshaw had retired to the drawing-room, Mr. Littleboy, with his heavy face lighted up by an unusual amount of eager cunning, drew his chair towards the fire, and then looked round with coarse 
                     curosity
                     curiosity
                   to see how his guest would manage to do the same. But even quicker than he had moved, Fitzgerald turned around and established himself as comfortably on the opposite side.
               "Now," said Littleboy, "I'm all attention."
               "Nay, my good friend, it is you, as the client, whose part it is to make your statement, and ask my opinion, as your legal adviser."
               "My statement is very quickly made. I think it may be proved that the late Mrs. Martha Blake, of Upton Manor, was not of sane mind when she made that will, leaving all her property to her niece, Miss Marian Harley."
               "Very good," said the lawyer, "can you produce any evidence—any witnesses?"
               "Yes, several. Servants who lived with her, for instance."
               "Very good. And supposing it possible to set aside this will, is there another in existence?"
               "Not that I am aware of."
               "What then is your interest in this business?"
               "My interest?" stammered Littleboy, looking very much confused. "My interest? Oh!—I—I have no particular interest."
               "Come! come! my good sir! This will never do," replied Fitzgerald, "there must be no reservations from client to lawyer. You have an interest, or you would not take so much trouble to attain the object."
               "You can hardly call it an interest, however," mumbled Theodore, half audibly; "the fact is, I owe her a grudge. She has insulted and outraged me. And I want to be revenged upon her!"
               There was a deal of dogged ferocity in the manner in which this was said, which was not lost upon the astute visitor. He leaned back in his chair, half closed his eyes, and reflected.
               "Now, Mr. Littleboy," he said, aloud, in a very placid voice, "you really must be more explicit. You assert that this young lady outraged and insulted you; but you must also tell me the amount of provocation that she received. What had you done to provoke her?"
               "Nothing—nothing upon my soul! I made her an offer of marriage, and she turned my suit into ridicule! She did, upon my soul."
               "Now, tell me, what other interest have you in this?"
               "None, upon my honor."
               "Very good. And who claims the property in case this will is set aside, and Mrs. Blake is found to have died intestate?"
               "I—I—I—believe I am the nearest male heir," stammered Littleboy.
               "Ah! Now, then, we come to something tangible at last—" said Fitzgerald, sitting upright, and looking wide awake, "now we arrive at the real gist of the matter! None of us poor devils, Mr. Littleboy, can afford to go to war, or to law, for an idea, unless it is an idea that has been worked out, and patented. I shall take care that full justice is done to your case, though it will nominally be in the hands of my partner. Miss Harley will probably employ Jarvis, and I have no wish to come in collision with any of the Tattleton folks. You, my dear sir, are the only person in this neighborhood with whom I have maintained any correspondence, since I left the place two years ago; and as I come back much altered in appearance, under a different name, and in considerably improved circumstances, I don't think I run much chance of being recognized."
               "No, indeed!" cried Mr. Littleboy, with a coarse laugh, "no one who sees you cutting such a dash in that splendid carriage of yours, would suspect you of being the poor devil who used to ride about on his brother's shoulders."
               "And you feel confident," continued the guest, calmly ignoring his host's vulgarity, "that Miss Harley's agent is no other than my brother John?"
               "There can't be a question about it. I know him well enough by sight; his name is John Morton ton; and I've heard the whole story of his having walked from London. He caught a fever on the road, was exposed to an awful thunder-storm, and recovered his eyesight during his illness. They say he became blind during a fever. Is that true?"
               "I've heard something of the sort," replied William, indifferently, "but being the younger, of course I do not recollect accurately. I shall drive over to your coal mine to-morrow morning, and satisfy myself regarding his identity. Not that I intend to make myself known to him, for his conduct towards me has been so extremely ungrateful, that I have no wish to renew any intimacy. But I have the feelings and affections of a brother, all the same; and I should be glad to be convinced from my own observation that he is in a fair way of doing well in the world."
               When Mr. Fitzgerald retired to his bed-room, he dismissed his servants for a short time, while he examined some papers which he took from his writing-desk. They were bill-stamps for large amounts, and though the body of the paper was left blank the signature of the acceptor was written on all in bold characters, and that signature was John Morton.
               Then he drew out on blank paper the forms of various bills, for sums corresponding to the signed stamps; but after awhile he put them all back, saying, "They must not be written in my hand." After which, summoning his servants, he went to bed.
               
               While John Morton was busily superintending his workmen on the following morning, a handsome open carriage stopped at a short distance, and Mr. Littleboy alighted from it. With some difficulty he waddled over the rough ground to the wooden shed which served the overseer as a counting-house, and engaged him in a conversation respecting the quality of the mineral which had been obtained on the two properties. While talking, he contrived to stand so that John's face should be turned towards the carriage, where William reclined with an air of indifference, though every nerve thrilled as he saw that the man before him was indeed his brother.
               John's communication to Mr. Littleboy was not very satisfactory. The works upon the estate of the latter had been retarded for want of funds, and he relied for information respecting the deeper strata upon his neighbor's reports. These had not hitherto been favorable. Mr. Littleboy had hoped to hear something better to-day—something that would induce Fitzgerald to make him the pecuniary advance which he wanted; and which that keen man of business withheld until the value of the coal mine was determined by the experiments made on Miss Harley's land.
               Mr. Littleboy waddled back to the carriage with greater difficulty than he had experienced in walking from it; for then he had been buoyed up with hope, whereas he was now sunk in despondency.
               The beautifully hung carriage was just bowing beneath his ponderous weight, which threatened destruction to the springs, as he deposited himself by William Fitzgerald's side, when a shout from John Morton was heard, and he came bounding over the rugged ground, his face beaming with pleasure, and, a large lump of coal in his hand.
               "Good news for you, Mr. Littleboy!" he exclaimed, "good news for you, and for everybody!"
               "Drive on! Drive on!" said Fitzgerald, in a hoarse whisper, as he shrank back into the corner of the carriage. But the coachman did not hear him; and John was already at the door.
               "Look at this!" said he, exhibiting his treasure in triumph. "They have hit upon another seam which promises to be a deep one, and this is a specimen of the coal. This is a black diamond, I feel certain."
               "Is there the same in my land?" demanded Mr. Littleboy, with trembling eagerness.
               "No doubt of it. But you will have to go deeper for it, as the seam dips considerably. Will you take this piece with you, and try how it burns, or wait till my folks bring you a basketful?"
               "Are you in a hurry, Mr. Fitz"—but a sharp nudge from Fitzgerald warned him not to mention his name, nor notice him in any way. "Thank you—thank you, Mr. Morton, that piece will be sufficient. Will you have the kindness to give it to the coachman?"
               John Morton, however, had gazed for one moment full into the eyes of Mr. Littleboy's companion panion, and they seemed to send an electric shock through his strong frame. He turned deadly pale as he mechanically placed the lump of coal upon the foot-board, and turned to catch a second glance at those eyes which affected him so strangely. But the stranger was flourishing his handkerchief before his face, and John could not obtain another glimpse of him before Mr. Littleboy, after a profusion of thanks, congratulations, and adieux, gave the coachman the order to drive on.
               "It is marvellous! Perfectly marvellous!" said John, as he watched the carriage rolling away. "I can never have seen that man, but where then have I seen his eyes? For I have seen them; and it must have been before I became blind. Yet that can't be, for he is no older than I am. It was a likeness, perhaps. Ah! Have it now! His eyes resemble my mother's! The only eyes that shone upon me during all those years of darkness! And yet they are not like hers. They are not so soft—so tender. How should they be? What eyes could look like a mother's?"
               Being satisfied of the probable productiveness of the mine, Fitzgerald agreed to advance a sufficient sum to work it, with a promise of further aid, if required, when the rich seam was struck upon.
               He took his departure the following morning, but instead of returning to Tattleton, he drove to the next station up the line, being doubly fearful of recognition, now that he was convinced that John had recovered his sight.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               BECKY PRICE IS INQUISITIVE AND HYSTERICAL.
               MISS BECKY PRICE was excessively inquisitive. At the same time she had the most unbounded faith in her own powers of penetration, and was fond of boasting that nobody could deceive her.
               To John Morton she affected the airs of an artless, innocent, not over-prudent child. A little gushing creature, governed solely by her feelings, which she was too unsophisticated to hide.
               She was careful to hide her overweening curiosity from masculine perception. Even her father would have asserted, in perfect good faith, that Becky never troubled her head about what did not concern her. Yet she wound her way into everybody's secrets, nevertheless, as people who see through millstones generally contrive to do.
               There was one habit of John Morton's, however, which puzzled her completely. He would sometimes hire a horse, and ride away always in the same direction, remaining absent five or six hours. He did not go to Upton Manor on these occasions— she had convinced herself of that fact. Where, then, did he go?
               Once, a letter arrived for him, directed in a lady's hand. She could not make out the post-mark, but as soon as he read it, he ordered the horse and rode off. On his return he was very thoughtful; and, for a week or ten days, he received, every morning, a letter in the same feminine handwriting. These letters, to her great annoyance, he carefully burned; but a few weeks afterwards, on his return from one of his visits, he took a paper out of his pocket-book, and locked it up in his desk.
               Miss Becky's resolution was taken at once.
               She bought a lump of wax, and watching her opportunity, remarked that one of his keys was spotted with rust, and begged to be allowed to clean it. A bit of sand paper removed the rust; from that key, and her lump of wax received the impression of the key of his desk.
               The next day she went to Tattleton, and ordered a key to be made from the impression. When this was accomplished, every secret of John Morton's correspondence was open to her unscrupulous eyes.
               What was her amazement on finding that the document was a receipt for a quarter's schooling of Miss Bessie Morton. There was also a doctor's bill, for attendance on the same young lady.
               Who could Bessie Morton be? Was she his child? Was he married, and separated from his wife?
               Her patience was rewarded by the discovery of another letter from the schoolmistress, in which Bessie was spoken of as his niece.
               "Never mind," soliloquized the amiable Becky, "I won't be plagued with her very long. When once I am married to him, I will get rid of this Miss Bessie, or I'll know the reason why!"
               All these events bring my story to the sixth week of Miss Becky's operations against John Morton's peace of mind.
               Captain Price was going to London in a few days, and that would afford her a good opportunity to bring matters to a crisis.
               On the first evening of her father's absence, Becky interceded with her mother to let the servant have a holiday, and also prevailed on her docile parent to go out to tea, promising to follow her as soon as she had made tea for Mr. Morton.
               She was very fussy over this tête à tête meal. In very high spirits too; indeed, almost kittenish in her infantine gambols. She made steady, thoughtful John laugh several times at her sallies; and then having seen him comfortably ensconced in his study, she told him she was going out to enjoy herself immensely.
               He wished her a 
                     pleasent
                     pleasant
                   evening, plunged into an abstruse calculation, and—forgot her existence.
               Not very long, however. Scarcely an hour had elapsed when he heard the outer door open and close hastily; a few unsteady steps were taken in the hall, accompanied by stifled sobs. He started up to ascertain what was amiss, but hardly had time to snatch up the lamp, when, with a low moan, some one fell to the ground.
               He opened the door, and there, near the foot of the stairs, as though she had been trying to escape up them, lay the inanimate form of Becky Price.
               He replaced the lamp, and carried her to the sofa in his room. She was perfectly rigid, and he began to fear she was dead. However, her pulse still beat, though feebly, and he looked about for restoratives. No smelling salts—no eau de cologne—not anything could he find, except a glass of water, with which he sprinkled her pale face.
               He rang the bell, but no one responded.
               He was going off to fetch the nearest neighbor, when her hand closed round one of his fingers.
               "Becky! my dear child!", he said, in a soothing tone, "what is amiss with you? Let go my hand, that I may fetch some one to see to you."
               "No!—No!" she gasped out. "Don't let any one come! Don't let any one find me here!"
               "You are in my room, dear; you are quite safe."
               "Oh! how cruel it is to, say such wicked things! I don't deserve it, and I'm sure you don't!" she continued, sobbing. "Oh! let me get away from here! What will they say if they see me?"
               She made an effort to rise, but only succeeded so far, that in falling again she sunk into his arms.
               John Morton was horrified. Her broken sentences could not fail to have a peculiar significance even for one so little disposed as himself to suspect evil. After carefully replacing her on the sofa, he walked up and down, in deep thought, till she was sufficiently recovered to speak collectedly.
               When her strength returned she staggered to her feet, and was leaving the room with a dejected air.
               "Stay," said John Morton, gravely, "Sit still, Miss Price, you owe it to yourself, as well as to me, to explain the words you have just uttered."
               "Oh, dear!" she cried, piteously, "what have I said? I don't know. Perhaps I said too much!"
               "You said either too much or too little," he replied; "what you have said cannot be recalled. You must therefore say more. For both our sakes you must tell me what it was that caused this fainting fit."
               "I can't tell you, Mr. Morton! Indeed I can't! it would be very indelicate!"
               "But you have already told me in part."
               "What did I say? I don't know what it was; and I can't tell you any more," she sobbed, with every appearance of the most poignant distress.
               "My dear child," began John Morton, but checking himself he added, "No—no, I must not call you so any longer. You are not a child."
               "I'm glad you've discovered that at last, stupid!" thought she.
               "Dear Becky, then—if I may say so," he continued, "since you cannot bring yourself to tell me the cause of your distress, will you answer candidly to a few questions that I will put to you?"
               "I will try," was the half audible reply.
               
               He walked up and down the room. Then stopped in front of her and asked in a low, distinct voice.
               "Has any one been slandering you?"
               "Yes! All the people in the village, I think."
               "Was my name connected with these scandals?"
               "They have found out—I don't know how—that I am often in this room," she sobbed out, "and then they said that I was—was—was"—
               "Was what, Becky?" he asked, tenderly.
               "Too fond of you."
               "And is that true?" he demanded.
               Her only reply was to bury her face in her hands.
               "I did not suspect this," he said, seating himself by her side, and passing his strong arm round her slender waist. "But if it is true,—if you really love me, Becky, we can quickly silence the venomous tongues of these scandalmongers."
               "Oh!" she exclaimed, with a cry of delight, "tell me what you mean!"
               "That we will be married, darling, that is all. No one can say one word against you after that."
               "What! Do you love me too?"
               "I do indeed," he replied, kissing her, "though I did not know it till this evening."
               It would have been singular if he had known it sooner, seeing that the feeling only sprang into existence in answer to her avowal of her love for him.
               When Mrs. Price returned home, her daughter made such explanations as satisfied her that the least said about the scandals which had brought about this happy result, the better. Both mother and daughter also joined in entreating John Morton not to mention anything of the sort to the Captain, who was so fiery that he would quarrel with, horsewhip, and challenge the entire male population of Combe St. Nicholas, if he suspected that they or their female relatives had been instrumental in spreading calumnies concerning his daughter.
               John Morton willingly gave his word to preserve absolute silence on the subject. The best way to put a stop to such reports, he said, being to announce the fact of their engagement.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               IN THE DEBTOR'S PRISON.
               AND how fared it, in the meantime, with Marian? Poor girl! The moated grange itself could hardly have seemed more dreary than did the bright little home which, but a few months ago, she had so rejoiced at possessing.
               The only occupation in which she took an interest was that of attending to the comforts of her poor neighbors in the village, improving their dwellings, and educating their children. She had lost all her buoyancy of heart. She was more patient with the children; more thoughtful for the infirmities of age; more tolerant of ignorance and stupidity than she had been; but her joyous laugh was never heard, and her very smile was sad.
               Mr. Hunter and Lucy had many a quiet chat about her. It was not so long since they had been sufferers from the miseries of hopeless love, for either of them to mistake the symptoms of the mental malady under which Marian was sinking.
               One morning Mrs. Hunter ran into her husband's study to announce that she had seen John Morton walk up to the door of the Manor House.
               All day she waited for some joyful news. Every moment she expected to see Miss Harley make her appearance, with that indescribable halo around her face which tells of happy love, and which is said to make even the plainest woman beautiful for once in her life.
               When evening came, she paid a visit to Marian, and was told that she had gone to bed with a headache. Lucy concluded that Mr. Morton had only come about business, and that Miss Harley's illness was purely accidental.
               She knew not what to think, however, when, in the gloom of the following evening, Marion stood suddenly before her, so pale, so subdued in manner, that Lucy felt overawed, and could only receive her communication without question or comment.
               Marian came to tell her that business required her immediate presence in London, after which she would go on to Paris for a short time. The affair was very sudden; she was going by the night train to town, and had no time to say adieu to any other friends, but she commissioned Lucy to say everything in her name, that politeness required. If advised to do so by the Paris physicians, she might possibly visit the Spas of Germany, as her headaches had become very distressing. She left a kind message for Mr. Hunter, regretted that he was not at home, (why, then, had she postponed her visit till she knew he was out?) and bidding her young friend adieu, walked slowly home.
               So Marian went away, and an hour later the curate found his wife sitting where she had left her. It was not till she had had a good cry that she began to recover herself; and then he told her that he had met a basket-carriage, which he had now no doubt was Miss Harley's, conveying a lady at a rapid pace towards Minton Station.
               "She was probably going there," he said, "to avoid the remarks of the good folks of Tattleton. But what could Morton have said to produce such an effect upon her? There can't be a doubt that it is something connected with his visit that has caused this sudden determination. To-morrow, I have little doubt, will clear up the mystery."
               He was right. The morrow brought them news that fully accounted for Marian's abrupt departure. Mr. Morton was going to be married to Miss Becky Price!
               The important business which had taken Marian to London occupied her for several days; though strange to say, during that time she received no visitors, and never left the hotel, except for a hasty walk.
               On the day after her arrival she wrote a short letter to John Morton, informing him that she had given Mr. Jarvis a power of attorney to act for her in all matters relating to her property, during her absence, which might be prolonged for some time, as she intended accompanying some friends on a visit to France and Germany. She ended with a commonplace expression of her wishes for his happiness, and signed herself, "Yours truly, Marian Harley."
               Poor Marian! The friends whose company she was to have during her tour, were only her own sorrowful thoughts and hopeless love. Her sole mortal companion was a quiet, orderly, middle-aged Swiss waiting-woman, whom she engaged to travel with her. She roamed about the continent, finding consolation nowhere. The only things that aroused a moment's interest were the letters which Mr. Jarvis sent with praiseworthy regularity. These letters were usually devoted wholly to the dry details of business, but occasionally there was an allusion to John Morton, and I am sorry to say that it was precisely these portions that possessed a peculiar attraction for the fair reader.
               Once, about two 
                     month's
                     months
                   after her departure from Tattleton, the expression occurred in one of these communications, that something had, or had not been done, "owing to the absence of Mr. Morton, who was gone to the Isle of Wight to spend the honey-moon."
               It was all over then! He was married, and she solemnly vowed that, for the future, she neither could nor would ever think of him again.
               The only change which this intelligence produced in her conduct was that she became more restless and uncertain in her movements, and less anxious for letters from home; so that they frequently quently accumulated for weeks and even months before she reached the post-town to which she had last desired Mr. Jarvis to address them.
               Thus it happened that on her arrival at Florence, nearly a year after the commencement of her wanderings, she found three letters from her agent, the last bearing the word "Immediate," written conspicuously on the top.
               Marian opened this hastily, and at the first sentence turned deathly faint. It was dated April 20th, and ran thus: 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "DEAR MADAM:
                              
                              "Not having heard from you in reply to my two last letters, in which I informed you of the sad calamity which had befallen Mr. Morton, I fear they must have miscarried, and therefore take the liberty of recapitulating the information they contained.
                              "Early last January, Mr. Morton consulted me respecting a bill for ¥900, which had been presented to him for payment, but concerning which he assured me he was completely ignorant. His signature—which you may have remarked, is a very peculiar one—had been so successfully imitated that he acknowledged it would be impossible for him to deny it, without the corroborative testimony of the fact that he had never signed that, or any other bill, and that he was totally unacquainted with the drawer of the bill, a man of bad character, named Michael Jones, who was drowned on the voyage to Australia, when the emigrant ship Antelope went down, as you perhaps remember, with all hands on board. It seems highly probable that this man forged Morton's acceptance in order to raise money for his journey, but the party who discounted the bill would not listen to such an explanation, and took proceedings against Morton to recover the amount. While the action was pending, two other bills, one for ¥1,000, and the other for ¥700, were presented for payment, and of course not honored, as Morton vows he never saw them, nor wrote his name on them. They also were drawn by Michael Jones, and accepted by John Morton; the forgery of his name being executed quite as cleverly as the first. The appearance of these bills produced a very bad effect on the trial. We lost our cause; Morton was immediately arrested, and now is in Whitecross street prison.
                              "I am sorry to add that this is not the only, nor the worst misfortune which I am under the painful necessity of communicating to you. The will of your late aunt, Miss Blake, has been disputed by the heir-at-law, on the ground of mental incompetency at the time it was made. My opinion is, that this is merely a vexatious claim, set up from malicious motives, and that we shall be able to establish your right without much difficulty; but it has, meanwhile, the disagreeable effect of stopping your income, and even of precluding you from occupying your own house.
                              
                              "As your legal adviser, I beg strongly to urge upon you the necessity of an immediate return to England.
                              
                                 "I have the honor to be, &c., &c., &c.
                              
                           
                           
                              P. S. You are doubtless aware that the heir-at-law is Mr. Littleboy."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               In two hours everything was settled. The Swiss maid, with no stronger signs of regret than if she had been a piece of mechanism, had left her generous mistress, and taken service with a stranger, and Marian started alone on her homeward journey.
               When the train reached London Bridge, Marian left her luggage, and walked out of the station. She had no idea how far it was to Whitecross street, nor even in which direction the horrid place was situated, and she was ashamed to inquire for it.
               As she stood undecided, a civil-spoken cabman drew up and asked her if she wanted a 'ansom.
               "Can you take me to Whitecross street?" she asked, in a low voice, lest any one else should hear her.
               "All right, ma'am. What number, ma'am?"
               "The prison," she replied, so faintly that he must have guessed at the words from the motion of her lips, and the anxious expression of her face.
               "All right, ma'am," said he again; and in twenty minutes she found herself at the door of the Debtors' Prison.
               If she had felt timorous at the mere idea of entering this frightful building, how much greater was her terror, as each clanging gate, after being opened for her admittance, was locked behind her.
               The last door through which she passed, gave admittance to a long, low room, with a space down the centre between two rows of tables, flanked by narrow benches.
               At most of these tables small knots of people were busily engaged in conversation. Very few took any notice of her, and even those who stared at her for a moment because she was a stranger, quickly averted their glances with an air of indifference. She looked around, expecting to see John Morton's handsome face, and not knowing what to do, nor of whom to make inquiries.
               At length, a thin, care-worn looking woman, very poorly clad, but neat and clean, who was sitting on one of the straight-backed benches with a small bundle on the table before her, rose and touched Marian gently on the arm.
               "Won't you sit down, ma'am, till your friend comes?" she said. "I see you are a stranger, and it's awkward when you're not used to the ways."
               "Thank, you," replied Marian, accepting the seat, "I am indeed strange to this place. I want to see Mr. Morton. Do you know where he is?"
               "He'll be here directly, ma'am, I daresay. They'll be sure to have called him. This is only the visitors' room, you know, ma'am, and the gentlemen are called over when their friends come to see them. Oh! there's Mr. Morton, ma am, just coming in. Poor gentleman! I only just know him by sight, for it's very few visitors he has, and so he's not often out in this room."
               Marian started up and turned towards the door.
               John Morton looked around with an inquiring glance, but with no apparent anticipation of pleasure from the coming interview. He looked thinner and paler than usual; but there was an expression of calm endurance on his brow, which told how nobly he supported his misfortunes.
               He had evidently expected to see some very different person, for he no sooner recognized Marian than his eye brightened, and his cheeks flushed.
               "This is indeed au unexpected honor, Miss Harley," he said, pressing her hand warmly. "I did not know that you were in England."
               "Don't talk about honor, Mr. Morton, not at least in the sense of a compliment, for I am but a poor girl now, and must work for my living again, until it may please the High Court of Chancery to give me back my property. Otherwise you should not remain here another day. I could not afford, you know, to lose you from the coal mine," she added, with a forced attempt at gayety.
               "I trust that you fully understand that it is for no debt of my own that I am here, Miss Harley," he said; "that it is altogether a mistake?"
               "Or a fraud. Mr. Jarvis has given me all the particulars, and I don't see how it can be a mistake."
               "Jarvis has doubtless told you all that he knows himself, Miss Harley; but there are other circumstances stances, known only to me, which would entirely alter the case if I were to disclose them."
               "Then why not disclose them, and get free from this horrid place?"
               "I cannot," he answered gravely; "that may seem an unsatisfactory reason to give, but it is not in my power to be more explicit. A moral obligation may be quite as binding as a legal one."
               "Certainly; and therefore it is of no use to say more on that subject. I have a proposal to make to you. You doubtless recollect a conversation that we had at the time you were recovering from the fever, when I read to you that letter from Mr. Fitzgerald, which led to our going to Combe St. Nicholas, and the discovery of the coal."
               "I remember it all every word."
               "I do not know what has caused the estrangement between you and your brother, and I should not feel justified in interposing in any way in family matters, without being authorized by one of the parties concerned. And therefore, I ask your permission to go to your brother, and try to persuade him to rescue you from this fearful dilemma."
               "Dear lady! Believe me, I am as grateful for your offer as I should be, could I accept it. But not to save myself from spending the rest of my days in prison, would I ask a favor of William Morton Fitzgerald, as he calls himself. Do not wonder at this. It is a portion of that which must remain unexplained, even to you."
               Marian bowed her head in acknowledgment of his decision, and said nothing more upon the subject.
               "And Mrs. Morton," she said, calmly, "does she come often to see you? Is she in town?"
               "Her health is delicate, poor thing," he replied. "She expects to become a mother in about a month, and even when in town she finds it too severe a trial, to her nerves to come here often. She is staying at present with her parents."
               There was a tone of sadness in his voice, and Marian forbore to question him farther. But she asked in what way she could be of service to him, what little comforts he required, and all the other questions which would suggest themselves to a kind-hearted woman under the circumstances.
               "May you smoke here?" she demanded.
               "Yes. I may," he replied, "but it is a luxury that I have learned to forego."
               "Why so? It must be a comfort."
               "Why do I do so?" he repeated, with a gentle laugh. "For the same reason that induces most people to give up enjoyments which they would indulge in if they could afford it."
               "Is that so, indeed?" said Marian, in a faltering voice, while she cast a glance of reproach upon her handsome dress and costly shawl; "then Mrs. Morton must be in want of a little help to provide for her baby. I shall be in funds in a day or two, and perhaps you will be so kind as to send to her. You need not say where it comes from."
               "Thanks, dear lady, but such kindness on your part is not needed. I am happy to say that my wife has had a small income left to her by some distant relative, which is sufficient for her maintenance. It is not much, only about a hundred a year; but it is a great consolation to me to know that she is not destitute through my misfortune."
               "And she'll let you remain in prison without a bit of tobacco!"
               The indignant speech was uttered on the impulse of the moment, without reflection; but quickly as she had spoken, she checked herself, and murmured, blushing deeply, "Of course she can't know anything about it, when she is at Tattleton."
               He made no remark, but was drawing a comparison between Becky and the warm-hearted creature before him, when Marian interrupted his reverie by asking if she might visit him again to-morrow.
               "Oh! no, Miss Harley," he replied. "This is no place for a lady to come to. You must have had a hard struggle already, to overcome your repugnance at entering a prison."
               "And like many another struggle, it was merely a shadow, a prejudice that I had to contend with. The porters are civil, the place is clean, and I really don't find it so disagreeable as I expected. And so, as I have several things to say to you that I cannot recollect to-day, I shall come and see you again. I must stay in London while my lawsuit is going on, and I shall be able to visit you sometimes, if you don't object to it."
               "Object! he repeated. "Miss Harley, the sight of a friendly face, the sound of a sympathetic voice, is the only consolation that we have in this dreary abode. You might as well ask if I object to a gleam of sunshine, or the song of a bird. But for your own sake you must not come. It is not a fit place for you. I am deeply grateful for your kindness in visiting me to-day; but I should reproach myself bitterly, were you again to subject yourself to the annoyances that you must have encountered."
               "I must have another conversation with you, Mr. Morton, so it is of no use to forbid my coming. Is that the signal for departure?"
               "I am sorry to say that it is. Once more I thank you, Miss Harley"—
               "Oh! nonsense! Keep your thanks till I have done something to deserve them," she exclaimed, forcing an appearance of mirth, to conceal a very different emotion, "Good-bye! Good-bye! I shall be locked in perhaps, if I don't make haste!"
               She hurried away without waiting for another word; but no sooner had she passed the outer door than a loud sob broke from her overcharged bosom, and the tears started to her eyes.
               "Not yet—not yet," she said, wiping them hastily away, "I have much to do before I indulge myself with that good cry that is choking me."
               So, resolutely mastering her grief, the brave girl went about her self-imposed task.
               Her first object was to find a suitable lodging within a short distance of the prison. After about an hour spent in a "bootless inquisition," she found a large airy room on a second floor, in a queer little tolerably quiet spot called Nichol Square.
               To this she removed her luggage, and by nine o'clock, quite worn out by the fatigues of the day, she laid her weary limbs and aching heart in the homely but comfortable bed; and suffering the long pent up tears to flow without restraint wept herself to sleep like a child.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               MARIAN LEARNS TO LABOR AND TO WAIT.
               REFRESHED by slumber, Marian arose and carried out her resolutions. She collected her jewels, her Indian shawls and valuable lace, and converted them into money with a stoical indifference which many a philosopher of the sterner sex might have found it difficult to rival.
               But to Marian nothing seemed a sacrifice that was done to serve John Morton.
               She loved him with all her heart and soul. She knew it well, and did not blush to own it to herself. Why should she? When he was free and prosperous, she had left him as soon as she knew that he was about to marry another woman. He was now a prisoner, and neglected by his wife. Heaven forbid that she should try to supplant that wife in his affections! But there was little danger of that. If he had failed to discover her feelings towards him in the early days of their acquaintanceship, when his heart was free, what danger was there now of his detecting the love that she hid so carefully beneath the veil of friendship? Besides, what a charming little plot she was hatching, to bring Becky up to town, and to coax her into the performance of her duties. Becky would get all the credit—but what of that? Heaven would know the truth, and John would reap the comfort, and what could Marian want more? She loved very intensely, and very truly; but it was not a selfish love.
               In about a week she succeeded in obtaining some pupils. These were three little girls, whose parents kept a large hotel within a short distance of the Bank. She went to them three hours every morning, and received in return one guinea a week. This sufficed for her own simple wants, and left unencumbered, for John's use, the sum she had raised by the sale of her clothes and jewels. She worked very hard. Not one moment in the day was wasted. As soon as she left her pupils at one o'clock, she hastened to execute any commissions she might have for her friend, so as to be at the gate by two, when it was opened for visitors. Three hours were then passed in the sweetly-sad occupation of soothing the captive's weary lot, and at five she returned to her room, to work busily at her needle. During the evenings she repaired John's clothes, and made new ones when required, and also made for herself a new dress of cheap and durable material, suited to her present mode of life. She went to bed every night completely tired, and awoke every morning to recommence the mill-horse round of monotonous labor. Yet, strange to say, she had never felt more healthy in body, nor more serenely tranquil in mind.
               
               She heard but little concerning the progress of her lawsuit, and after having again vainly urged John Morton to allow her to appeal to Mr. Fitzgerald, she ceased to trouble herself about his business, and devoted herself wholly to the task of making his present condition endurable.
               This was all the easier; because he was so calm and patient. There was an air of quiet dignity about him, as of one who heroically endures a wrong which he has not merited, and which he voluntarily bears from a motive that his conscience approves; and this, coupled with some few words that he had dropped in answer to her entreaties to be allowed to appeal to his brother, convinced her that the mystery of his signature to the bills was no mystery to him; but that he preferred to suffer imprisonment rather than produce the evidence that would set him free.
               Marian had settled down into this routine of work; when two events occurred which disturbed the quiet sameness of her life. The first of these was Becky's abrupt arrival; the second was an unexpected encounter with an old acquaintance.
               Marian was sitting with John Morton in the visitors' room, one afternoon, when the little woman came in, and no sooner caught sight of Marian than she thought it would produce an interesting effect if she were to faint. So she fainted accordingly; creating a sufficient amount of confusion and attention to gratify even her vanity.
               From this time John Morton's greatest source of consolation was gone. Becky would not live near the prison, because the air was not sufficiently pure for her, and it was such a low neighborhood. She took apartments at Kennington; and soon after discovered that her health would not allow her to visit her husband every day. Yet she would not time her visits with any regularity, but came as her caprices dictated; and as her jealousy of Marian could scarcely be concealed, the latter was compelled to absent herself almost entirely. As soon as visitors were admitted in the morning, she went in for a few minutes and took him whatever he required. Among other things she kept him supplied with materials for delicate basket-work, and carried his productions afterwards to a shopkeeper who had agreed to give a fair price for as many as he could make. He had urged his wife in vain to do this; her pride could not stoop to such degradation as letting her husband work at a handicraft. But Marian took a more rational view of the question. Work was good for him, she knew; and independence was still better.
               It was about a week after Becky's arrival in town, that Marian was hurrying homewards across Smithfield, in not the most cheerful state of mind, when she became aware that a tall young man, who had stared very hard at her as she passed him, had turned and was following her.
               She hastened her already rapid steps, and was almost running past a public-house when one of a group of men who were lounging at the door, caught her by the arm, exclaiming, "Hallo! My dear! Where are you running so fast?"
               She turned to remonstrate, when a black object darted over her shoulder, and the fellow lay sprawling on the ground, while the stranger seized Marian's hand, and ran swiftly onwards.
               When he had placed her ears in safety from the hurricane of elegant language which they had left behind, he paused to let her recover her breath, and standing where the light from a shop fell full upon his face, he raised his hat and said, "Do you not remember me, Miss Harley?"
               There was something very familiar in the tone of his voice, and yet she was at a loss to say of whom it reminded her.
               "Look well," he continued, "I don't think I am so much changed that you can't recognize me. And I should be very sorry to think that I was quite forgotten by you."
               "It should be—and yet it seems impossible;—you are so tall!"
               "Ah! I see you have twigged me! Yes, I am Harry Bowyer. The boy with the calf-love, as you used to call it. I'm afraid I must have been a regular nuisance to you."
               "Oh, dear, no!" she replied, "it was rather an amusement to me."
               "I see you have not got rid of your provoking ways, Miss Marian," said he; "but which way are you going? Surely, you don't live in this neighborhood?"
               "Yes; for the present I am lodging in Nichol Square. Do you know it?"
               "But what makes you live there, Miss Harley?"
               "I have some pupils near the bank, and I find it convenient for other reasons. But I can't invite you in, Harry; I can't have any visitors, because I have only one room. My circumstances are greatly changed since I was at Upton Manor."
               "Yes, and some other people's too," he replied, taking advantage of a gas lamp to study the expression of her face. "There's that good fellow, John Morton, has got locked up somewhere, for something he is as innocent of as you are."
               Her changing color told all he wanted to know.
               "Come in here," he said, leading her into a pastry-cook's shop, "the little room behind is empty, I see, and we can talk there quite privately though almost in public. You must have a cup of coffee. I am half a doctor already, and I prescribe it, after your fright."
               "And that reminds me," exclaimed Marian, "how shockingly remiss I have been. I have actually omitted to thank you for saving me from that horrid man! Did you not knock him down?"
               "Rather!" replied the young gentleman, complacently. "I flatter myself that there's a biceps in that arm."
               Seated in the recess behind the confectioner's shop, and sipping a cup of excellent coffee, a sudden silence fell upon them. Marian was lost in conjectures as to whether Harry Bowyer had any particular motive for mentioning John Morton; and Harry was reflecting on the best way of introducing the subject again. However, he was no diplomatist, and saw nothing for it, but to dash at it at once.
               "Look here, Marian—I mean Miss Harley."
               She obeyed him literally, by looking straight into his handsome, frank, boyish face.
               "You look sadly care-worn, my dear girl!" he remarked with a deep sigh; "your eyes have lost much of their brightness, and the beautiful color is fading from your cheeks."
               "One cannot expect always to retain the freshness of youth," she replied, "and I have had a great deal of trouble. It would make any one fret and grieve to lose all their property, I should imagine."
               "That is not your greatest trouble," said Harry, nodding his head, sagaciously, "the canker-worm that is feeding on your beauty lies hidden deeper than that."
               "You talk a great deal about my beauty," said Marian, forcing a little laugh, "but I know very well that I never was particularly handsome."
               "Not in the eyes of every one, perhaps," said the precocious youth; "but to me, as I think you ought to know, you were always the loveliest girl in creation, and more lovely in your sorrow than ever. However, I did not bring you in here to tell you all that, which I know you don't care to hear. I've discovered a secret of yours, Marian. John Morton is in yonder; and it is to be near him, and to help and comfort him, that you are pining away in this wretched place."
               "How did you learn all this? Is it known at Tattleton?" exclaimed Marian, blushing deeply.
               "No, no. Comfort yourself, dear; it is not known at Tattleton. All Tattleton believes you to be abroad. But I see I am right."
               Marian cast down her eyes.
               "But that is not the only discovery that I have made. Now, don't be frightened," he continued, as she raised them again in alarm, "can you not rely upon me not to use it to your injury?"
               "What is it?" she whispered, resting her forehead on her hand, so as nearly to conceal her face.
               He drew her hand away, and held it between his own, while he replied in the same tone, "you love John Morton!"
               "What nonsense!" she exclaimed, trying to look indignant. "Don't you know he is married?"
               "What difference does that make? 'Is human love the growth of human will?' Can I help loving you, without a shadow of hope? Besides, Morton was not married when you loved him first. I am quite sure that you are now doing all you can to soothe his imprisonment, and I want you to let me help you. I can appreciate and respect your love for him, on account of my love for you."
               "But, Harry, would it be prudent in you to"—
               "I know what you are going to say, and I say it would not be at all imprudent in me to see you constantly. I can't love you less, do what I will. And I don't think it is possible for me to love you more. And don't forget Mrs. Farncombe's proverb, either, Miss Marian, 'What is sauce for the goose, is sauce for the gander.' If it is not prudent for me to see you often, it can't be prudent for you to see him often."
               "But I am useful to him, Harry," said Marian, appealingly, for she was quite subdued by the boy's energy.
               "And I wish to be useful to you; and to him for your sake and his own. Let me be to you as a brother, and I'll ask for nothing else. After to-day you shall not hear one word of any but fraternal love from my lips. Don't drive me from you, Marian. Without knowing it, you are my guardian angel. A young fellow in London, even so young as I am, is exposed to a thousand temptations to do wrong. Strong—terrible temptations, which few can resist, especially when they are surrounded by bad examples. If I can say truly that I am one of the few—which I can—I owe it to no virtue of my own, but to my love for you. So don't dismiss me, through mistaken notions of kindness; but let me remain your brother."
               "You shall, dear Harry!" said Marian, giving him her hand in ratification of her promise. "And to-morrow we will begin to work together."
               "Now I can defy them all!" exclaimed Harry.
               When they parted in Nichol Square, they were both far more cheerful than they had been before they met.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               A LIFE FOR A LIFE.
               "PLEASE, Miss," said the maid-of-all-work as she opened the door, "there's a letter for you, up stairs."
               The note was written by Becky's landlady, informing Marian that Mrs. Morton had been taken ill, and begging Miss Harley would come to her as quickly as possible.
               Foolish, affected and disagreeable as Becky was, it was not in the nature of true womanhood to refuse compliance with this request. Marian only stopped to pen a hasty note to Harry, asking him to call on John as soon as his duties at the hospital would permit, and then to come on to Kennington.
               From that time Harry was constant in his visit to both places.
               On the third day, though scarcely able to stand, through mental and physical exhaustion, Marian, looking from, the sheet spread over an object on the bed, to a little creature in the nurse's arms, resolutely put on her bonnet and cloak, and said, "I must go to him myself. No one could tell him with so much gentleness as I."
               Harry Bowyer accompanied her.
               He seated her in a quiet corner, and retreated to a distance, not to intrude upon the painful interview.
               John Morton entered hastily. His eyes fell first upon Harry, who, by a glance, directed him to Marian. The solemn expression of the boy's face told plainly what had happened, and when he sat down opposite to Marian, his face, though calm, was deadly pale.
               Without looking up, she knew that he was there and extended her hand to him across the narrow table. Then utterly unable to speak, she laid her forehead upon their clasped hands, and burst into a passionate fit of weeping.
               After a while she attempted to speak, but the words were lost amid her sobs.
               "Do not distress yourself to tell me, my sweet friend," he said; "I understand what you would say. May God reward you for all your kindness to her and me."
               Still she tried to command her voice, and he at length distinguished the words, "A little boy! And that is all that is left to you!"
               "Do not say all," he replied, in a tone of deep emotion, when such a friend as you are, has not deserted me. You must not try to say more now. I know the main facts, and for any minor incidents, I can wait till you are somewhat restored. Three anxious and sleepless days and nights are enough to make you ill. Go home, now, and take some rest."
               He beckoned to Harry, and confided Marian to his care, with strict injunctions that she should go to bed, and steep as long possible.
               Harry promised obedience in her name, and moreover 
                     voluntered
                     volunteered
                   to run over to Kennington, and bring him news of his little son.
               I cannot say that John Morton was inconsolable at the death of his wife, though he felt a natural manly sorrow for the young creature whose life was sacrificed in giving birth to his child. He had not married her for love; and her silly and selfish character had not been capable of exciting that deeper and more lasting affection which sometimes grows out of a marriage contracted from other motives.
               Her loss cast a seriousness, rather than a gloom over his mind and manner; while, strange to say, his desire to quit the prison increased a hundredfold.
               Becky Morton's parents had arrived in town the day before her death, so that all responsibility respecting the funeral and the care of the poor little baby, was taken off Marian's hands.
               Mrs. Price (with John's permission most thankfully accorded) intended to take her grandchild home with her, and on the morning when the two old people followed the body of their daughter to the grave, Marian carried the baby to Whitecross street that John might see, his child before it was taken away.
               The indefatigable Harry met her at the door with a cab to take her back to Kennington, and after she had kissed her infant charge for the last time, and consigned it to its natural protectors, Marian felt that a void had been left in her life. John Morton in the meanwhile paced up and down in the gloomy prison, revolving in his mind what course he ought to take. He was at liberty to suffer his own prospects and himself to be sacrificed to his brother's selfish ambition, but Bessie's interests were at stake, and he had no right to let her be wronged. Marian too was looking pale, a life of toil and anxiety ought not to be her doom; and as long as he chose to remain a prisoner, it was useless to urge her to abandon him. He finally determined to let the punishment of guilt fall upon the evil-doer.
               Having come to this determination, he acted upon it at once, by sending for Mr. Jarvis. But that gentleman had gone to Germany on some important business, which detained him for nearly two months. He came, immediately on his return, and John proceeded to relate every circumstance of Bessie's being found on the night when Mr. Lonsdale and his brother's widow were thrown from their carriage, as well as all the events connected with himself and William.
               The lawyer heard the story with the utmost interest and attention, asking a question now and then, to throw more light upon some obscure point, When it was ended, he sat for some minutes in deep thought.
               "This is a case of considerable difficulty and obscurity," he at length began.
               "What!" exclaimed the prisoner, "obscurity! Why, my good friend, it is as clear as daylight!"
               "Morally it is," replied Mr. Jarvis, "but moral conviction is not legal proof. You see there are two questions of disputed personal identity to be settled; your own, and this little girl's. Your brother, it seems, has assumed the name of Fitzgerald. He may have a right to it, or he may merely have taken it for convenience. I should conclude that it is his by right, both because no sufficient motive is apparent for the assumption of a fictitious name, and because he induced you, while you were still blind, to write the name of Fitzgerald on a paper which was no doubt a power of attorney, or some other document conveying your rights into his hands. If it is his legal name it is also yours; but, unfortunately the proofs are in your brother's custody, and it will be extremely difficult to compel him to disgorge them. In fact, if he is resolved to play the rogue, it will be utterly impossible, for nothing would be easier for him than to substitute forged documents for those which you placed in his hands, and we have no means of detecting the fraud."
               "It is just possible that I may possess a proof, or at least a clue," exclaimed John, eagerly. "I secreted one of the papers which poor Mrs. Palmer gave me, and if I can now recover it, it may throw some light upon my family history."
               "Come—come!" said Mr. Jarvis, his eyes sparkling with eager anticipation, "there's some hope for you yet, my friend, since so much of the serpent's cunning is mingled with your dove-like want of guile. What is this document?"
               "That I cannot tell," replied John, "for, singularly enough, I have never so much as recollected its existence since the illness during which recovered my sight. It was concealed inside the lining of my coat, but all the clothes I then wore were condemned, lest they should retain the infection of the fever, and so I never saw it, nor, unfortunately, thought of it either, until this moment. The coat may have been thrown aside in some receptacle for rubbish, but more probably it was burnt."
               "Most annoying! Most provoking!" said the lawyer, "however, I'll have a strict search made for it. I'm going down to Tattleton to-morrow, and will see about it at once. The old housekeeper, who still has charge of the house, will be sure to know what became of it. In the meantime, I'll ransack Doctors' Commons for a will, with the signature of Fitzgerald or Morton. Keep up your spirits, my dear fellow. We'll get you through this business, and out of this dungeon before long."
               The prisoner replied with a sigh that was rendered yet sadder by the patient smile that accompanied it, and the kind-hearted lawyer departed. Just outside the gloomy portal, he encountered Miss Harley.
               "Oh! Mr. Jarvis!" she exclaimed, "I knew you were in there and I have been waiting to see you. Have you heard about my lawsuit? Does Mr. Morton know?"
               "Know what, my dear lady? The case cannot be decided till next term."
               "Yes, it is—it is decided. Poor Mr. Littleboy had a stroke of apoplexy, which caused him to reflect on the wrong he had done, and he dictated a letter telling me that he would withdraw his claim, which he knew to be unjust, as it was only done out of malice, because I had done something that vexed him,"—
               "Refused to become Mrs. Littleboy, wasn't it?"
               "That was the cause of offence, but I don't consider it anything to boast of. Well—the poor man had scarcely performed this act of restitution, when he had a second stroke, and died. I am not such a hypocrite as to pretend to feel any regret at his death, but it is a comfort to reflect that his last act was an honest and praiseworthy one."
               "I sincerely rejoice that you have recovered your property, Miss Harley," said the straight-forward man of law, "because you make a good use of it, but for the life or death of such a cumberer of the ground as Theodore Littleboy—considered without reference to its influence on your fortune—why, it's not worth a thought! John Morton will be delighted to hear of this. You are going in now, I suppose?"
               "Yes, I am going to see him; but I shall not tell him of my change of fortune for a day or two, and I want you to promise not to mention it to him. Will you give me your word, Mr. Jarvis?"
               "I don't see what object you have in view, young lady," said the lawyer, eyeing her through his spectacles rather sharply; "but I don't imagine it is anything very wicked; though, as a general rule, I observe that when ladies assume that coaxing tone of voice, they are up to some mischief. However, I don't hesitate to give you the promise you require. It can be only for a short time, for Morton is sure to hear of Littleboy's death."
               "I shall tell him myself in a day or two," replied Marian, "and even then, please don't tell him the exact date."
               "Coaxing again!" exclaimed Mr. Jarvis. "There must be some roguery at the bottom of this! But I shall find you out, never doubt it."
               "If you do," said Marian, blushing deeply, "I only beg of you not to tell Mr. Morton."
               "Believe me, my dear Miss Harley," replied the lawyer, with sudden gravity, "I would not for the world say anything that might lower you in John Morton's estimation. Excuse me—I must catch that omnibus!"
               He ran off, and Marian retraced her steps to the prison.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               FREEDOM.
               DURING her interview with John Morton, Marian's manner was so serious and subdued, that he pressed her to disclose the cause of her trouble.
               "My pupils are going to a boarding-school in the country," she replied, casting down her eyes, for she felt ashamed of her little deception, now that she came to put it in practice, notwithstanding the excellence of the motive by which it was prompted.
               John thought she tried to hide from him her looks of sorrow, and inwardly resolved to prosecute his claims with increased vigor for her sake; but he said nothing, for in addition to his natural reluctance to speak of his brother's wrong-doing, he desired to cause her a pleasant surprise by his sudden change of fortune.
               Marian remained only a short time, during which she was even more thoughtful and taciturn than her altered circumstances seemed to account for. Soon after her departure he was again summoned to receive a visitor, and found a grave, middle-aged man, apparently a lawyer's clerk, who informed him that the bills and all expenses had been paid, and that he was once more a free man. It was in vain that he sought to discover who had done this. The messenger evidently spoke the plain truth when he said that he knew nothing about it. He had been sent by his employers, an eminent firm in Lincoln's Inn, who doubtless acted for a client, but he knew no more, except that, after paying the sums for which he was detained, he was to hand over fifty pounds to Mr. Morton, and take his acknowledgment for the amount. John had no hesitation in ascribing this action his brother William; but whether it was dictated by an awakened conscience, or by fear of discovery and punishment, he had no means of judging. Neither did he scruple to take the money thus strangely sent to him, believing that it was his own.
               When he passed out of the horrible gate of the prison, the smoky atmosphere of the dirt street seemed like the pure air on a mountain's top, for it was the air of liberty. He stood for a moment, uncertain which way to go, when a Hansom dashed up, and Harry Bowyer sprang out.
               "You here! You out!" exclaimed the boy, his handsome face all aglow with excitement, and his eyes starting almost out of their sockets with astonishment. "Come along! Get in! make haste!" and snatching John's valise out of his hand, he pushed him into the cab, and had hardly scrambled on to the foot-board, encumbered as he was with the luggage, before he shouted to the drivers, "Home! Back again! Anywhere, so long as you get out of this!" Then sinking into the seat, he gazed earnestly at his companion, grasped his hand, his shoulder, shook him as if to make sure that he was a reality, and finally bursting into a half hysterical laugh, he exclaimed, "Why, yes! It is Mr. Morton! How did you get out, sir?"
               John, bewildered on finding himself at large after his long imprisonment, had yielded unresistingly to Harry's impetuous onslaught; but, quickly recovering himself, he joined in the laugh.
               "I think I am John Morton," he replied, "and if I really am myself, and am not dreaming, somebody has paid those bills and set me free. But just at present I am not prepared to be quite certain about anything."
               "Then you had not broken out!" said the boy. "I thought you had; and that made me in such a hurry to get you safe off."
               John again joined in the laugh at this mistake.
               "It's better as it is," said Harry, "and I came up at the right time after all. I was coming to you with a budget of good news. By Jingo! Everything seems coming right all together."
               "What news were you bringing to me?" asked John. "Is it—does it—concern Miss Harley?"
               "Yes,—there's every chance of her getting back her property."
               "I always looked upon that as a certainly, it being only a question of time."
               
               "But old Littleboy has had an apoplectic stroke and has sent her a message, asking her forgiveness, and promising to withdraw the suit."
               "Why, that looks well," replied John, "and to-day I am disposed to take a hopeful view of everything. Yet we must not forget that Mr. Littleboy may alter his tone, should he recover."
               "That would be too late, after his confession," said Harry; "Miss Harley feels so sure about the business, that she has moved from the attic where she has been living all this time, poor dear girl, and taken two rooms on the lower floor."
               "Humph!" grunted John, not too well pleased at the term of endearment which this precocious youth made use of in speaking of Marian, "how old are you, Master Harry?"
               "Seventeen, sir," replied the lad, ingenuously; "do you think I am too old or too young to speak so affectionately of Miss Harley?"
               "You are rather juvenile to be so patronizing to a grown-up lady, I think," said John, quite taken aback by the boy's frankness.
               "Oh! don't call it patronizing, Mr. Morton!" said Harry, hanging his head; "it's nothing of the kind. I'm not too young to be desperately in love with her, though I'm not old enough to have any hope of gaining her love, even if her heart were free. So I just go on loving her, and serving her in every way that I can; and I'd lay down my life for her, Mr. Morton!" he added, with enthusiasm—"No nonsense, you know, but really, and feel happy in doing it, and be amply rewarded if she would love me ever so little for it."
               "Does she know of your attachment?" asked John, thoughtfully.
               "Oh, yes! At first she only laughed at me, That was long ago, at Upton, when she used to give me cakes and sweets, and treat me like a child. But now she acknowledges that I am old enough to love her seriously."
               "And yet she admits you to intimacy," said John.
               "Ah! that's just her goodness and generosity! I told her I was surrounded with temptations, and ran a great risk of being devoured by sharks if she turned me adrift altogether; so she trusts me, and lets me be her friend. And now I set all the fellows at Bartholomew's at defiance, for I could not look Miss Harley in the face again, could I, if I let them lead me into anything wrong."
               "I see that many grown men might take example by your chivalrous love, my dear boy," said John, laying his hand on his companion's shoulder, "and that many women would be the better were they as free from prudery as Miss Harley is. And she loves, you say—but I have no right to inquire into her secrets. Where are we going?"
               "To my lodgings first," replied Harry, glowing through every fibre of his frame beneath John, Morton's words of praise, and the kindly pressure of his hand; "there you can wash off the fumes of that horrible place, and then we'll go together and take tea with Miss Harley."
               
               "Oh no! That's impossible! I could not intrude on her uninvited," stammered John.
               "And a pretty figure I should cut, were I to go there without you!" cried Harry "I am going by invitation. She sent me a note, telling me about poor old Littleboy, and requesting me to go to you without delay, and let you share the good news. After that I was to come and take tea with her, as on the strength of her brightening prospects she had descended to the drawing-rooms. What in the world will she think of it, if I tell her you are at large, and refused to come and thank her for all her kindness, just because she hadn't sent you an invitation? It can't be done, I tell you. So come along, and sacrifice to the graces."
               The cab stopped as he spoke, and he led the way into his cosy bachelor apartment.
               In less than half an hour, washed, brushed, freshly clothed, and neat as a gentleman should be, John Morton was prepared to accompany his young companion on a walk to Falcon Square. The distance was but half a mile, and John was delighted to exercise his limbs, and likewise glad of the opportunity to recover his self-possession before entering Miss Harley's presence.
               When Marian quitted the prison, she walked back to her temporary abode, and by re-arranging the furniture in the sitting-room, and embellishing it with such little odds and ends as her private resources afforded, she contrived to impart to it a look of home and feminine occupancy.
               At every sound of wheels in the street she ran to the window and looked eagerly out.
               "Can anything have happened to defer his liberation?" she murmured, as she turned away and began to stir the fire for want of something better to do. "He would of course come here without a moment's delay. That would take five minutes,—it is now a quarter past five. Ah! yes!—it must be so. He is not yet free. He must spend another weary night in that horrible den!"
               The thought quite overcame her; and bowing her face upon the arm that rested, on the mantel, she burst into a fit of weeping, from which she was roused by the voice of the servant, saying, "Please, Miss Harley, here's Mr. Bowyer, and another gentleman with him." Turning hastily, forgetful of the tears on her cheeks, she found herself face to face with John Morton, not prison-stained, as she had expected to see him, but fresh and radiant as if he had just returned from the mountains.
               Harry Bowyer had settled it quite to his own satisfaction, that Marian was the unknown contriver of John Morton's release; but when he beheld the glow of unfeigned surprise and happiness that lighted up her tear-dewed face as she clasped his hand, his belief was shaken.
               "And yet," he reflected "for whom were all these preparations made? Not for me, that's certain. I see it all as clear as mud! She'd given him up for to-day because he was late, and so of course cried about it, poor darling!"
               
               In the meantime Marian had grasped both John Morton's hands and swayed him to and fro, and writhed her supple waist in the excess of joy, and came so near clasping him in her arms that she was frightened at herself. He, fortunately, retained his self-possession (Harry's presence no doubt assisting), and that helped Marian to recover hers, which, after crying a little more, and laughing a great deal, she finally accomplished.
               "Oh! Mr. Morton! I am so glad! I was afraid—that is, I thought—Oh! I don't know what I thought, or what I feared! But it's all right, now you are free! How did it happen? Sit down and tell me all about it. And Harry, too! Dear, good Harry! what should we have done without you?"
               And she shook Harry by both hands, and laughed again. John Morton, on the contrary, was very grave. The warmth of her reception awoke in him hopes and thoughts that threatened to overturn his self-control, and in the effort to preserve his composure, be became almost stern.
               Marian, in the exuberance of her joy, paid no heed to this. The warm pressure of his hands had responded to hers, and he might speak or be silent; she understood him all the same. So she laughed and talked with the careless freedom of a happy child, until his reserve passed away, and, reversing the usual order of things, the boy was the most sedate of the little party.
               The plentiful tea-dinner was a complete success, and it was really wonderful what a variety of delicacies cacies Marian had provided for the one guest whom she professed to have expected. When the meal was over, however, John suddenly fell into a fit of deep sadness. He was leaning against the mantel, just where Marian had been when he entered, when his eyes fell upon a box of cigars, He raised the lid and saw that it was full.
               "Do you smoke, Harry?" he said, in a low tone.
               "I began it, but Miss Harley persuaded me to give it up till I am older."
               John's eyes seemed to be suddenly opened, as he looked round the room, and comprehended for the first time the many tokens of preparation for some expected visitor.
               "And I am keeping him away," he said to himself, while a crushing load of jealous misery fell upon his heart. "She is too generous to let her disappointment appear in her manner, but I will not stay to receive the hospitality that was intended for another. Harry must have known of this, and should not have urged me to come. I must wish you good evening, Miss Harley," he said, in a hesitating way, as though he were at a loss for an ostensible motive for leaving; "I—I—fear I have already intruded too long upon you; and—and I have to find a lodging somewhere for this night at least."
               "What have I done?" exclaimed Marian. She put her hand in his as she spoke, but not to bid adieu, for she continued to hold it firmly. "People would say," she went on, looking him frankly in the eyes, "that my womanly pride ought to make me resent this sudden and seemingly capricious change in your tone and manner; but I have—I can have, no feelings approaching to such pride where you are concerned, Mr. Morton—we have suffered too much together for that, and I know you to be incapable of caprice. There must be some misunderstanding. Come back, and let us explain it away."
               She led him, docile as a lamb, back again to the warmth and brightness of the cheerful blaze; with the gentlest possible push, made him sit down on the ample sofa, and then offered him the offending box of cigars, saying, as she did so, "Let us see if a little smoke will not make things clearer."
               He took a cigar—for how could he refuse it from her hand?—but sat mechanically rolling it between his fingers. He could not light it—the smoke would have choked him.
               With his almost feminine quickness of perception, Harry had read every phase of John Morton's thoughts since his first question about the cigars; and a struggle had taken place in his boyish heart. Here was a misunderstanding—a little cloud no bigger than a man's hand, which might result in a storm, whereby his hopes might be nourished. But the chivalrous spirit, which was his highest attribute, won the victory after a short combat.
               "Look here, Marian—Miss Harley, beg pardon," he said, "it's those cigars. He thinks you got them for some other fellow, and that he is keeping that other follow out of the way, and"—
               "Harry! Harry! you talk too wildly, sir!" exclaimed John, almost angrily.
               "Unkind! Unkind! How could you think so?" murmured Marian, bowing her face upon her hand.
               "If I dared but think otherwise!" he whispered, sinking back on the sofa from which he had started. "Will you give me a light?"
               What induced him to ask Marian to give him a light, he never could explain. But she smiled through her tears, and lighted an allumette, which she held towards him. But instead of taking it from her, as a gentleman should have done, he merely approached her trembling hand with his cigar. If her hand trembled, however, his strong frame trembled much more, and how that cigar ever managed to get lighted, it is impossible to say. Lighted it was at length, and its soothing influence was felt by both so powerfully, that no further explanation of their temporary misunderstanding was either volunteered or called for. Marian talked on a variety of indifferent subjects, rather nervously at first, but with increasing self-possession, until they were both quite at their ease again.
               The evening passed only too swiftly, but at last the two gentlemen departed, with an understanding that they were to dine with Marian on the following day. The hour agreed on was late to accommodate Harry, who would be obliged to attend very strictly to his studies, to make up for the time he had devoted to the service of his friends.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               A TELEGRAM.
               JOHN MORTON thought the time would never come when he was to return to Marian's presence, but five o'clock came at last, and Harry's quick step was heard on the stairs.
               In due time they found themselves in Marian's cosy apartment, where a telegram for John Morton had arrived a short time before.
               "It must be from Jarvis," said John, as he opened it, "no one else could send to me here."
               It was brief, as such missives usually are.
               "The coat not found. Inquire of Miss H."
               He read it aloud, almost before he took in its meaning; but immediately crushed it into his pocket, muttering, "Pooh—pooh—that's nonsense."
               "What is the meaning of that enigmatical message, Mr. Morton?" inquired Marian, "did Mr. Jarvis send it?"
               "Yes, dear lady, he sent it, But it is of no consequence."
               "I don't think Mr. Jarvis would amuse himself by sending useless telegrams," persisted Marian, "and who, may I ask, is the Miss H., of whom he requests you to make inquiries? Is there any Miss H. among your friends besides Miss Harley? If there is not, I desire to be questioned forthwith."
               "Oh no!" replied John, "it's perfect nonsense of Jarvis imagine that you can know anything about it."
               "But what is it? What coat does he allude to?"
               "The coat I wore when you found me and Lion by the wayside, that's all. There was a paper or document in it, which might be useful in establishing my claim to some property, besides leading to a more positive knowledge of my family, than I at present possess. Jarvis has been hunting for my old garments at Upton, but as he cannot find them, it's most likely they were destroyed."
               "I examined all your pockets carefully," said Marian, "and gave you everything they contained."
               "The paper I speak of was not in the pockets. It was concealed under the lining. I don't know what it was. It may not have been of any importance, and it is of no use regretting its loss."
               Marian was silent, and the matter dropped.
               After dinner Harry left, to visit an out-patient of Bartholomew's, in whom he felt an interest.
               It is wonderful how the presence of a third person keeps unavowed lovers at their ease. John and Marian had been in the full tide of lively conversation; but no sooner had the door closed behind Harry Bowyer, than a dead silence fell upon them.
               
               At length, when the silence had become actually oppressive, Marian started up, went hastily into the adjoining room, and returned with a parcel neatly tied up in brown paper. She cut the string, put the parcel into John's hands, and sinking into an easy-chair, hid her burning face in the cushion.
               He held the parcel for a minute, looking from it to her, not knowing what to do with it. To do however, was easier than to speak. She evidently meant that he should open that parcel, and accordingly he proceeded to do so. And what did the mysterious and romantic contents prove to be?
               A set of masculine habiliments, minus the hat and boots!
               They were old worn clothes, but folded neatly, and strewn with lavender, rose leaves, and many fragrant herbs. John looked at them in astonishment, as he took them one by one. When he came to the coat, he started. Then he closed his eyes, and feeling about the breast, he drew forth a small folded paper, which he threw, without looking at it, upon the table. The paper might contain the key to a princely fortune; to the proudest title in the land; aye, even to a kingdom; but the preservation of those old, worn-out garments, gave assurance of a far nobler possession—the love of a true woman's heart. So the paper lay unheeded, and his wildly beating heart was calmed, and he bowed his head upon his breast, and a whisper passed his lips, that might have been a prayer.
               Then he laid the old garments quietly aside, and the odor of the fragrant things that love had embalmed them with, floated through the room, and he rose, and holding out his arms, said, "Marian, what does this mean?"
               She writhed, as if in pain, and wept as if in sorrow.
               "What would you have it to mean?" she whispered.
               "If it could but mean what I would have it to mean, it should mean—that you love me!"
               "It does! it does!" she cried; and at one bound she was in her lover's arms.
               Ah! who can depict the rapture of that hour—the one hour which remains forever the sunlight of lifetime? which is the central light, transcending all that hope had depicted, and which remains, through sorrow and darkness, the brightest glory that memory can recall. The light of a false love fades away and is forgotten; but the glory of a true love, though dimmed by tears, though torn by wrongs, though chilled by coldness, by change, by absence, still remains the one foretaste of heaven which we are permitted to know on earth.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XL.
               THE FOUND LETTER.
               WHEN Harry returned, after an absence of nearly three hours, he found John Morton reading the Times, while Marian was stirring up the fire, which was nearly out. A single glance told him that the opportunity he had given them for a mutual understanding had not been lost. He took the poker from her hand, replenished the fire from the wood-basket, and quickly fanned it to a cheerful blaze.
               "There," he said, "that is a sign that the person I love best is very happy, is it not, Marian?"
               "I believe it is said so, Harry," she replied, meekly, and without the usual rebuke for his familiar use of her Christian name.
               He said no more, but his quick eye soon detected the coat, with the evidence of careful preservation in its well-brushed state, and uniform creases.
               "Is the missing document found at last?" he asked.
               "Oh! John!" exclaimed Marian, "you have forgotten the paper! Why don't you read it?"
               "I am reading it," he answered, raising his head from the advertisement sheet of the Times.
               "No, no, not that, but this little paper that was in the coat."
               "I had indeed forgotten all about it," he said, unfolding it.
               It was a sheet of thin note-paper, and the writing was in a delicate female hand. He turned to the signature, and then back to the address.
               "I don't think it concerns me, after all," he remarked; "it is signed Leonora Fitzgerald, and begins 'my beloved son.' But I'll read it at any rate. 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "MY BELOVED SON:
                              
                              "I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must soon leave my two helpless babes to the mercies of a world which has shown no mercy to me. I dare not trust any man with the secret of your birth, for I have found men too false to be trusted; and even a lawyer pays more regard to an unjust law, simply because it is law, than he does to the rights of nature, which say that a mother has an unalienable claim to her own children. So I dare not trust even a lawyer, lest he should give you up to the wicked man who, to my sorrow, I must call your father.
                              I leave all the papers necessary to prove your rights, both to your family name, and to the property left to me and you by my uncle, with good Mrs. Palmer. She cannot read them, and has promised mised to keep them until you are of age. Her ignorance and humble station will afford you

                              "I know not what it is that prompts me to write this brief abstract of what the documents will fully prove; I am so ill that I can barely bold my pen, or command my thoughts to write it. Yet I must write it, I cannot die in peace till it is done. My maiden name was Leonora Fortescue. I married an Irishman named Fitzgerald, and suffered from him every cruelty and indignity that a man can heap upon the woman whom the

I had no parents, and my uncle left me forty thousand pounds in the funds, for my own sole use as long as I lived, and it was to go to you after my death. He knew that my tyrant kept me without money, and thought to secure me some comforts in this way; but it only added to my misery. My husband always waited for me, and took the money out of my hand as I left the bank. On one pay-day, however, he was absent; I set off alone to the city, with a beating heart, taking you with me. When I came out with my half-year's income in my pocket, my tyrant was not to be seen. I hastened down a court which I thought would lead me into another street. It did, and there I took a cab, and told the driver to take me to Bishopgate street. I knew that was somewhere at the east end of London, where he would be unlikely to seek for me. Then I walked a little farther, and took another cab to Islington, where I bought some homely outer garments, for both of us, and at night I started, in a third-class carriage on the Great Western Railway, for Tattleton. I do not know why I chose this place, unless it was because I knew nothing of it but the name. Perhaps a merciful Providence directed me. I did not dare to enter the town, but wandered about all day among the neighboring villages, without seeing one house at which I felt I could venture to ask for a lodging. Night came on, dark and stormy. You were tired and cold, my precious boy, and I was obliged to carry you. Oh! the terrors of that night! The weariness!—the despair! But for you I should have lain down in a snowdrift, and yielded my life and that of my unborn child to a peaceful death. But for your sake I struggled on, and reached Mrs. Palmer's door.
                              "My strength fails me—I have been a long time writing this. She has promised to be a mother to you both, and to send you to school. I have given her all the money I possess, for your support. She has all the papers, too, and I have written a list of them on this letter. Oh! must I leave my darlings to the cold world, without any protection but this poor ignorant woman! Yet better that, than to let their father have them. All will be bright to me soon. May God in his mercy watch over you, and guide you aright, is the prayer of your dying mother.
                              
                                 LEONORA FITZGERALD."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               John Morton—or, as I must now call him, John Fitzgerald—pressed his lips reverently upon the signature of his mother's name, and sat for some minutes in silence.
               "Poor mother!" he sighed, with infinite tenderness, "her face was the last object which I saw before I became blind; and yours, my Marian, was the first that beamed upon me when my sight returned. How could I help loving you?"
               Marian reproved these words and the demonstration that accompanied them, by casting a hasty glance towards Harry, who reclined in the further corner of the sofa, with his eyes closed.
               "He is asleep," whispered John.
               "Not so," she replied in the same tone, "look at the tears stealing down his cheek. Poor boy! I wish he would not be so foolish."
               "He will be all the better and nobler man for what you call his folly. If I had a son"—
               "If!" cried Marian, interrupting him, "Do you forget that you have one?"
               "Indeed I did," he said, with a blush and a laugh, "for I was imagining a lad very different from anything that that poor little fellow can ever become; and I was going to say, that if I had a son of Harry's age, I would wish him no better safeguard from the various temptations to which youth is exposed, than a pure though hopeless love for such a woman as yourself."
               "I don't like to hear you speak so slightly of your little son," said Marian; "remember he is your son, and may grow up to be just as good a man as you are."
               "And I would wish him to be much better. There's little probability of that, I fear; for you know that be it for good or ill, sons usually inherit the qualities of the mother."
               Marian could not truthfully controvert this by putting in a word of commendation for Becky.
               "Education and training may do much for him," she said, quietly, "and as soon as we are settled at Upton, we will send for him. Mrs. Price will not be sorry to be saved the trouble of having the child with her, if we only let her have the money; and I'm sure we don't want to keep it."
               "And will you really burthen yourself with the care of that child?" he asked, suppressing a smile at the energy with which she disclaimed all desire for Becky's little inheritance.
               "Will I not?" she repeated, with vivacity. "I should fail very much in my duty to you, if I refused a mother's care to your motherless child."
               "Then I shall have some hopes for him, and he may perhaps grow up a fine fellow after all. And by all means let the old folks have the money. I would never touch it, were I earning my bread by basket-making."
               Marian replied with a look of fond approval.
               "And Bessie," continued John, "what is to be done about Bessie?"
               "She must live with us too, of course."
               "I really believe you were born a mother, my darling," replied John; "but you must recollect that William is her legal guardian, and it would take an order in Chancery to compel him to give her up, if he chose to claim her."
               "You have him so entirely in your power that he will do whatever you choose to dictate. But don't let us talk about him, it makes you sad. Yet if I may give one word of advice, on the subject, I would say, deal with him leniently, that he may have time for repentance."
               "I will, my angel. I think I will go to him tomorrow, and talk the matter over with him in a brotherly way. What think you?"
               "By all means, go; but—let me go with you, please."
               "Certainly you shall, if you wish it," said John, "though you need not fear that I shall forget my promise to you, and deal harshly with him. William, has wronged me grievously, but my own measure of happiness has been filled so full, that I cannot refuse to forgive him if he shows any contrition. And even Bessie, if he restores her fortune, undiminished, will not have suffered any irreparable injury, for, thank Heaven, I have always been able to keep her at a good school."
               "Yes—even when you were denying yourself the comfort of a smoke in that dreary prison," said Marian, pouting.
               "My love, if I had not been able to manage it alone, I should have asked you to take her to live with you, and perhaps, after all, that would have been the best education she could have had; for I believe of you, what a Frenchman said of a lady, that to know you intimately is in itself a liberal education."
               "That's true," observed Harry, rousing himself from his pretended nap, and rubbing his eyes, as though he were still sleepy, "isn't it time we were going?"
               Marian looked "yes" at her lover. She had understood that the poor boy had purposely absented himself during the evening, and she knew by experience what he had suffered since his return.
               John took the hint, and they departed.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LXI.
               MEETING OF THE BROTHERS.
               THE following morning saw John and Marian exploring the dreary respectability of Wimpole Street.
               As they approached the house which William still occupied, a handsome travelling carriage rolled from the door. In answer to John's inquiries, the servant said that Mr. Fitzgerald was at home, but he did not know whether he would see any one on business, as he had only that moment returned from his wedding excursion. Suppressing all appearance of surprise or interest—though Marian instantly jumped to the conclusion that the gushing and disinterested little widow, Mrs. Col. Mitchell, had succeeded in netting the wealthy lawyer—the two visitors entered the waiting-room, and Marian sent in her card, with a request for a professional interview.
               After a brief delay, they were ushered into the legal sanctums.
               William was seated at the table in his usual elegant morning costume. When his eyes rested upon the towering form of his injured brother, his naturally pale face became perfectly cadaverous, and he tried to rise from his chair and escape; but, like the ancient mariner, John "held him with his glittering eye," even if nature had not denied him the usual powers of locomotion.
               "Remember your promise," whispered Marian, pressing her lover's arm, for she saw the signs of violent emotion rising high in both the brothers.
               John did not answer, but strode towards William apparently oblivious of Marian's presence.
               Arrived within a few feet of the crippled man, be stood with folded arms, gazing down upon him.
               "Will," he said at last, in a broken voice, "this is only the second time that I have looked on you! Will—little Will—that my mother left to my care when was hardly less a baby than yourself—give me your hand, Will, and, if you will only say that you regret the wrong you have done me, (and, mind, I know it all, for I kept one paper out of the bundle Mrs. Palmer gave me, and that gives the key to all the rest,)—only say you are sorry, Will, and I will forget it all. Poor Will! you were sorely tempted, and you could not know I should get my sight again; and so, Will—dear brother Will, for our mother's sake, just give me your hand, and say you regret what you have done."
               The strong man knelt to the weak, the good and noble sued to the guilty, as though he were the transgressor. William struggled in vain to keep up his assumed character; his head sunk upon his breast, then his arms fell upon his brother's neck, and, some inarticulate sounds broke from him as he tried to speak.
               But the action was significant enough; and Marian, who had requested to accompany John in this visit, not, as he had supposed, that her presence might be a check upon his harshness, but that it might protect him from any evil machinations, on William's part, completely, broke down, and, for the first time in her life she went into violent hysterics.
               When the scene was afterwards described to Mr. Jarvis, who, in the joint capacity of legal adviser and personal friend, was, entitled to know it, he said—taking at the same time a huge pinch of snuff—that it was just like her. She always did the right thing at the right time, and when that fit of hysterics was over, the two brothers, without any unpleasant explanations had come to a mutual understanding, and never needed to recur to the painful events that had parted them.
               Unconscious of the good effect her feminine weakness had produced, Marian felt heartily ashamed of herself, and was glad to retreat to the drawing-room under the care of Mrs. William Fitzgerald, who had been summoned by her husband, in company with her salts and eau de Cologne, and in whom Marian recognized, as she had expected, her whilom chaperone, the artless widow.
               "So strange, isn't it, my dear?" exclaimed the bride. "I really don't know what to make of it! William never told me he had a brother! Now, do tell me all about it."
               "I really don't know what there is to tell," replied cautious Marian; "I cannot account for every act of Mr. William Fitzgerald's. No doubt he will tell you himself."
               "Hm—hm—hm," hummed the wife of a month, doubtfully, "I'm not so sure of that, my love. He can be very close when he chooses. But what made you go into hysterics? You, who used to be so self-possessed?"
               "Have you not heard," said Marian, "that my title to my little estate has been disputed? I have been deprived of it for two years, and now it is all settled, and my right is quite clear—I can resume possession to-morrow, if I will. But I have been much troubled and agitated about it naturally."
               "And was it that which caused your hysterics?"
               "Oh! pray don't talk about it—I feel ashamed of having made such an exhibition of myself."
               But the demon of jealousy had taken possession of the bride, and refused to be exorcise by such an evasive answer.
               "It is very singular, to say the least of it, Miss Harley, that you should be so greatly affected, just when you heard of William's marriage."
               "Why, my dear Mrs. Mitchell—I beg pardon—I mean Mrs. Fitzgerald," said Marian, laughing at the other's jealousy, "if I refused him when I was so completely free, that I had not even seen the man I would dream of marrying, is it probable that I should go into fits at hearing of his marriage, now that I am engaged to somebody else?"
               "Engaged!—Are you engaged?" exclaimed Mrs. Fitzgerald, throwing her arms around the woman whose eyes she could have scratched out a minute before, "why didn't you tell me so before, you naughty creature? Now tell me—who is the happy man?"
               "That I shall not tell any one till I am married," said Marian, still laughing, "for you know there's many a slip 'tween the cup and the lip, and what if he should run away with somebody else?"
               While Marian thus bantered and evaded the curiosity of her former chaperone, the two brothers held a long conversation, very different in character from what either of them would have anticipated an hour before. The evil influences which had so long held William in subjection, making him selfish and avaricious, seemed to have fled away before the gaze of his brother's loving eyes.
               John had come there determined to exact strict justice from his erring brother; but William looked so like his mother, whom John remembered well, that love had sprung up and displaced indignation; while William, conscious as he was of guilt, had been so overcome by John's gentleness, that he humbly acknowledged his transgressions, and instantly resumed his old place in that brother's manly heart.
               "And there is Bessie Lonsdale, Will," said John, looking hard at the toe of his boot, as though he were the culprit, and dreaded to meet the unflinching eye of justice.
               "Bessie Lonsdale!" cried Will, turning very pale, "she is dead."
               "If you have been told so, you have been deceived; I have had her at school ever since she left Upton. Marian wishes her to live with us, which will be best for her, and when you are prepared, Will, Jarvis will receive your statements and look into everything connected with her property."
               Will hung his head, and acquiesced.
               "I am rejoiced to hear that she is not dead," he said. "I have often feared that I was, to some extent, the cause of her death. But, being alive, I will make every restitution."
               Marian was soon after summoned to the office. She and her lover resolutely declined William's invitation to dine with him, but accepted the offer of his carriage to take them back to Falcon Square.
               The next day saw them on their way to Tattleton, Harry accompanied them to the station, and bade them a smiling farewell, with many a jocular assurance that he should speedily follow them. But Marian was not surprised when, a few days later, Mrs. Bowyer informed her that Harry was going to Germany to pursue his studies.
               John Fitzgerald became the guest of Mr. Jarvis, but Tattleton was not to be hoodwinked. He had not been in the place an hour, after his arrival in Marian's company, before they "had it on the parade" that the two were engaged lovers.
               Dr. McCorquodale immediately called upon Miss Sedgeley, and made her an offer of marriage, which I need hardly say was accepted, and I must add, to her credit, with not the less pleasure, because she had, only an hour before, received an intimation of the death of a distant relative who left her an income of three hundred a year. For a moment the not unnatural suspicion arose in her mind that these two pieces of good fortune might be connected in the relation of cause and effect. But as she had not mentioned her accession of property to a single creature, and no one in the town could possibly know it, she dismissed the idea, yet wisely resolved to keep her news to herself till her engagement was widely known, lest the men on the parade should pronounce, as they assuredly would, that Dr. Mac had only married her for her money. She preserved the secret even from the doctor himself till the wedding-day was fixed, and she had received her first dividends, on the strength of which she made preparations for so stylish a wedding, that Tattleton was blinded to other people's movements; and John Fitzgerald, sauntering out one morning in his usual quiet way, went to Upton without attracting the slightest notice, and accompanied Marian to the little church, where Mr. Hunter married them in the presence of his wife and the parish clerk.
               Bessie found a true home at Upton Manor, and a loving mother in Marian. She promises to be a beautiful, amiable and accomplished woman, and I fear that Marian has some match-making design in her head by the time Harry is to return from his foreign sojourn.
               Marian's designs regarding her little step-son were frustrated by its death. John immediately made over Becky's small property to her parents, and nothing was left to remind him of the great blunder of his life.
               As soon as she heard that Marian was married, Miss Grimshaw paid her a visit. She was thinner and more cadaverous than ever, for the poor woman had really loved that monstrous mass of fat, Theodore Littleboy, and had fretted much for his loss. She brought Marian a present, which she begged her to accept, and to keep forever in memory of the departed worth which, unfortunately for herself, she had not known how to appreciate. It was a massive gold ring, set with a large carbuncle, which the departed Theodore had been in the habit of wearing on one of his fat fingers. Marian received it with a good grace, and promised to keep it safely. Solaced by this assurance, the mourner departed, and Marian locked the precious relique out of sight, comforting herself by the reflection that Miss Grimshaw could not expect her wear it, as it was so much too large for a ring, while it was not quite large enough for a bracelet.
