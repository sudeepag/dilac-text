            SEVERAL years since, a considerable portion of the sheets comprising the following
               story were shown to me: but circumstances needless to be explained, then prevented
               its completion. My recollections of it were awakened afresh quite recently, while
               perusing extensive manuscripts of a somewhat kindred character—developing the mighty
               influence of a mind of different order, trained, like the heroine of this tale, in
               New England principles and habits, and bearing them thence to the far West, to be the
               seminal elements of far, wider diffusion, and in a more genial soil, for the
               cultivation of what is indispensable to our country's welfare and honor. This
               coincidence prompted in me the desire that this true story should be given to the
               public, and the author was now enabled to complete it.
            
            But his earnest wish—for reasons important to himself—was to send forth this historiette anonymously: and as fictions, and tales
               assuming only to be "founded on fact," with a large measure of imaginative
               embellishment, so much abound, it has been thought requisite for some responsible
               name to give assurance to the truthfulness of what is here written. I have been
               appealed to for this service, as one who—as well as the distinguished individuals to
               whom the little volume is inscribed—has the requisite knowledge, from the close
               proximity of my birth-place to the opening scenes here depicted, and from having
               visited more than once, in my wanderings, the western home also of the Emigrant's
               Mother—just to prefix, as I now do most willingly and conscientiously, my assurance
               of the entire truthfulness of the following statements. Only a change in a few of the
               names of persons and places has been made to secure the incognito. The slight appearance of romance, if such there be, in the
               story, has not been sought for or contrived, but was only the conjunction, under
               God's favoring providence, of events adapted to awaken gratitude and call forth
               praise to the ALL-WISE DISPOSER.
            A word more in reference to the title of this story. The word "Emigrant" now, almost
               exclusively, is applied to designate one who has come from another country. Not such
               was its principal use forty years since. Then, when a larger number and a more
               valuable quality of the influx into our western States were accustomed to come from
               New England and New York, rather than from Europe, this was the common term applied
               to them, and this use of it is here preserved. As to the importance to our beloved
               country of the large infusion of the industry, economy, and enterprise of those
               reared in hardship and privation on the comparatively sterile hills of the eastern
               States, brought early into the vast and fertile plains of the West, carrying with
               them intelligence, and in many instances the love of order, morals, religion and
               social progress, with its needful safeguards, there can be, I presume, no question
               among those who have carefully and without prejudice studied the mighty problem now so rapidly, and, on the whole, so
               auspiciously developing in our national progress.
            In this aspect the following story, besides the beautiful simplicity of early manners
               among the humbler classes which it pictures to the life, as they were known to exist
               half a century ago, has also a lesson of instruction of a higher kind, for the
               reflective reader who loves to gather up the teachings of God's good providence in
               the affairs of families and communities, which in the aggregate swell into the
               magnitude of nations, and command the attentive interest and profound study of the
               philosophical historian.

                     "The brief and simple annals of the poor."
                  
               
               
                  IN the closing years of the last century, Diantha Jones, the
                  principal subject of this narrative, was found in the ambiguous station of a
                  servant and a companion in the family of an humble Christian pastor. His residence
                  was in one of the newly settled townships of New England. The members of his flock
                  were few, scattered and poor; quite unable to afford him an adequate support. But
                  his was no mercenary regard; he felt rather, toward all the members of that little
                     community, the affection of a father.
                  That small church had been gathered by his evangelical labors; and though other
                  and more inviting fields often tempted him to leave, yet he steadfastly resisted
                  the allurement, and seemed resolved—as they had been his first charge—so would he
                  abide with. and serve them, till death should release him, or age and infirmities
                  disqualify him for his official duties.
               The family of the pastor consisted of a wife in very poor health, and three sons.
                  The eldest of these was a vigorous young man nearly seventeen years old, whose
                  daily toil assisted largely in their support. The second, seven years younger, was
                  beginning to render some assistance, and the youngest, little Reuben, was still a
                  nursling of less than twelve months. Under such circumstances it may be easily
                  understood how important an event in their domestic history tory was the arrival
                  of Mrs. Diantha Jones; or, as the children, by a large contraction, soon
                  accustomed themselves to call her, "Miss Ana." This name gradually almost
                  supplanted the other, and became the familiar and not disrespectful appellation by
                  which she was known in the family and throughout the immediate neighborhood.
               She was now a widow, about thirty years of age, of middle size and quiet demeanor.
                  She had known more of hardship and sorrow from her earliest years, than of the
                  enjoyments of this life. An orphan child, she had been committed to those whose
                  tender mercies were cruel, and was at length snatched from the experience of
                  severities which must ere long have proved fatal to her, by the interposition of
                  some of her relatives. She had not been fortunate in her marriage; but after a few
                  years her husband left her and went to
                  sea, and she never heard from or saw him afterward. Thus left, with an infant son
                  entirely destitute, she was enabled to put her trust in the Lord, whose gracious
                  promise to the widow and the fatherless, she failed not to experience. After
                  having struggled on for some years, thus lonely and dependent, till she had reared
                  up her little boy to an age when it was practicable to engage him for the
                  remainder of his minority to a respectable farmer in a neighboring township, she
                  found a place for herself, as above related, in the family of the worthy pastor at
                  Brookdale.
               It may be readily understood, however, that the situation of Mrs. Jones was not
                  enviable. The inadequate income of the family with which she resided, and the ill
                  health of the mistress of it, threw no small burdens upon her.
               In the early period, when our narrative commences, most of the families of
                  moderate circumstances, in that vicinity, were accustomed to prepare almost their
                  entire clothing by a species of industry which was indeed domestic
                     manufacture. The wool and the flax from which their cloth was made, had
                  to be carded, and spun and woven by hand, and to her the family soon came to look
                  for the performance of nearly all the processes of this entire service, in
                  addition to the usual toils of the kitchen and the dairy. From the early dawn of
                  day, to the close of the evening, she was engaged in almost unremitted but varying
                  service. This was rendered more tolerable because she had long been accustomed to
                  it. She was also conscious of being useful, and that the value of her services
                  were gratefully appreciated. More than all, she was treated with uniform kindness
                  and respect spect. Here too she regularly
                  enjoyed religious privileges to which before she had been a stranger. With the
                  close of Saturday evening her toils ended; and the Sabbath's holy rest enabled her
                  always to visit the house of God, and experience the refreshing influence of the
                  worship and the pious instruction there enjoyed. She always shared also the
                  delights of social religious exercises; sending up from the domestic altar the
                  morning and the evening sacrifice, accompanied with the devout reading of a
                  portion of the sacred Scriptures. For such privileges she had often sighed; and
                  now that Providence had in these respects favored her, she wisely regarded her
                  daily labors, heavy and constant as they certainly were, to be no more than she
                  should expect in the otherwise favored position which she occupied.
               To follow through a single day's routine tine of her "service at all work," may
                  furnish a better idea of the nature and amount of this toil, than could otherwise
                  be gained.
               Rising with the lark, she assisted the boys in milking the cows, then arranged the
                  milk either for butter or for cheese-making ere she prepared breakfast for the
                  family. After this repast, and the invariable season of family worship, there
                  followed the regular work of the season, carding and spinning, or weaving, which
                  was of course subject to such interruptions as the preparation of dinner brought
                  along with it. When this principal meal had been dispatched, and the incidental
                  clearing away had been attended to, she would return for a few hours to the
                  regular work, before it was time to get supper. After this frugal meal, and the
                  evening chores*
                   had been attended to, there
                  remained some little interval, varying with the seasons of the year in its length,
                  before the hour of evening prayer and repose: this was busily occupied with the
                  needle, either in making or mending the clothes of the family. It is true the
                  pastor's wife rendered such aid in some of these services as her infirm health
                  allowed. But enough remained each day to fill up all the moments, and tax to the
                  fullest power of effort and endurance the faithful Miss Ana. True, her severe
                  toils were the more tolerable to her, because she was surrounded and associated
                  with those who were necessarily alike industrious; and we all bear our own hard
                  service more easily, when those around us cheerfully submit to the same.
               
                  
                  *A significant New England word, embracing a variety of small work and cares,
                     held subordinate to the principal labor.
               
               A small farm, of rugged, repulsive aspect pect, but not unproductive, was occupied
                  by the pastor. So much of his labor as could be spared from his professional
                  duties, with that of his sons, and a little occasional assistance from some of his
                  considerate and kind-hearted parishioners, enabled him to clear and till these
                  acres, which in turn yielded their various products. These assisted him to live
                  on, from year to year, exercising a frugal, but generous hospitality, and
                  providing for the necessary wants of his family. The sons were accustomed to labor
                  on the farm as soon as their age enabled them to be useful, during the summer
                  season, and in the winter they enjoyed the benefit of that glory of New England,
                  even in its earliest days, THE COMMON SCHOOL.
               When they were toiling over their evening lessons, interrupted as they often would
                  be by the intrusion of company pany into
                  the common sitting-room of the family, where, for economy's sake, but one fire was
                  kept up, or when some duty or errand for the family sent them away for an hour,
                  and they had to make up the task by fagging later than usual, the good widow Jones
                  would cheer them by a kind word or a considerate suggestion of their superior
                  youthful advantages to those which fell to her lot. She was "sure she would
                  willingly deprive herself of accustomed sleep, could she thereby secure such
                  schooling and such good learning as they were now attaining." Very well, too, did
                  she know how to mingle a little commendation with her counsel. If a neighbor had
                  spoken well of the pastor's sons, at just the right time and place where this
                  stimulus and comfort was most 
                     necessay
                     necessary
                  , she could hint it to them in a sort of enigmatical inuendo which
                  enhanced its interest and value. Did the teacher, who, in those days of primitive
                  simplicity, boarded around with the parents of the scholars, drop a word of praise
                  in regard to the fidelity, the studiousness, the success of these boys in their
                  studies, this, too, was laid up with provident carefulness by Miss Ada, that she
                  might repeat it to them just they they were beginning to get discouraged with some
                  very difficult problem, or to grow drowsy from long and late detention at their
                  studies. How earnestly, too, she seemed to help them all in her power by relieving
                  them of such services as she could "somehow" find time to perform, though out of
                  her usual line. Was an unusual amount of fuel to be brought in before a storm, she
                  put on her red hood and mittens and aided them sooner to accomplish it. Was a weak
                  and dying lamb to be nursed, and fed, and warmed for the night by the kitchen fireside, she would
                  take the care off their hands.
               Nor were other and less direct aids wanting on her part to assure them of her
                  lively interest in their respectability and progress. No matter at what cost of
                  toil and pains on her part, their clothes were always clean and ready for use at
                  the required season, and if in their straitened circumstances they could not put
                  on a new suit to attend school, as often as some of the wealthier neighbors'
                  children, how sedulous were her endeavors, and how full of nice plans and schemes
                  did she appear, in order that the old suits should look almost as well. Other boys
                  would sometimes be late at school, in the short dark mornings of winter. But her
                  care would never allow hers to be detained. They were called in time, if otherwise
                  they did not wake; and the breakfast was ready for them in due season. To these
                  little helps, she was wont to say, "our boys did not know how much they owed," in
                  getting on so well that both the older ones taught school themselves, with credit
                  and success, too, before they were "out of their teens." As she saw them rising in
                  the world, after they left their father's house, her kindly eye and loving heart
                  followed them, and often she seemed to be thinking with gratitude, that she, in
                  her humble way, had contributed to their advancement.
               Look in upon that family group, on one of the long autumnal evenings, when all are
                  gathered around the cheerful hearth. On each side of the candlestand sit the
                  father and the mother of the family in patriarchal precedence. He is reading aloud
                  one of the earliest numbers of a religious magazine, recently received, full of
                  interesting accounts of missionary
                  labors, sufferings, and discoveries in India and South Africa; together with some
                  journals of pioneer evangelical labors in our frontier wilderness settlements.
                  Some of these "traveling preachers" are his personal friends—his much-loved
                  ministerial brethren; and as they recount hardships, toils, successes in their
                  Master's cause, the unbidden tear often gathers in his upturned eye. He pauses to
                  add some word of personal explanation, and with his companion and faithful Mrs.
                  Jones he exchanges a few words; or, if "the boys" seek for any additional
                  information on the topics thus introduced, he delights to minister to the solution
                  of their queries, or wisely guides their thoughts into some profitable and
                  interesting channel. Their hands, meanwhile, are perhaps busied with some humble,
                  but useful service. The ripe apples or golden pumpkins are freed from skin and
                  cores, and nicely sliced for drying; or the earliest ripened ears of corn, as yet
                  scarcely dry enough for threshing, are skillfully shelled, that the new kernels
                  may be coarsely ground into the grateful hominy; or the tanned skins of the wild
                  animals they have trapped, are cut and braided into whips, or sewed into mittens,
                  both for their own use and to be exchanged at the country store for such little
                  articles as they may desire. Their mother meanwhile busily plies her knitting
                  needles, for the production of mittens or stockings of another material, and
                  little Reuben seated in the corner, by a large pile of faggots, consisting of the
                  knots or roots of the turpentine-tree, throws them at regular intervals upon the
                  fire, to give bright light for his own kind nurse, "Mits Ana," as he lispingly
                  calls her, while she cards the wool for the next day's spinning. Great is his joy, that making himself useful in this
                  way, and keeping very quiet, he is allowed to sit up an hour later than usual, and
                  that ever and anon he gets an approving smile both from nurse and mother, as his
                  faggot-light sheds around the large kitchen unusual brilliancy. But his eyes begin
                  to grow heavy, and his pile of light-wood is nearly exhausted; the clock that
                  "ticks against the wall," tells the hour of retiring; the good father for the last
                  half hour has laid aside his book, and vigorously assists his boys to earlier
                  complete their tasks. So that all is now "put up." Together they bow down for the
                  evening prayer, and each with cheerful, contented heart, seeks the quiet
                  pillow.
               Winter, with its snow-drifts and sleigh-rides, its careering storms without, and 
                     it
                     its
                   nuts, and apples, and other comforts within, has passed away.
               Smiling spring is changing into summer. Near half a score of years have passed
                  away since the opening scenes of our little story. The pastor's eldest son is
                  married and settled on a farm of his own. The remainder of the inmates hold their
                  former places, though the younger ones have grown apace.
               Mrs. Jones is evidently expecting some event of unusual interest. Her little cap
                  and apron are not only of faultless cleanliness, as usual, but they now seem
                  adjusted with more than ordinary care. For whom is she now "looking out?" The
                  suspense is soon relieved. There rides up to the door and dismounts, a fine, tall
                  youth-half way between a boy and a man. It is her own, her only son, Ammon, who by
                  consent of the worthy farmer to whom he had been apprenticed, comes regularly at
                  this season of the year, after the toil of planting has been completed, to spend some days with this loving but
                  rarely seen mother. If he were very sick at any time, she knows that "word of it"
                  would soon be brought to her, when in a few hours she could hasten to his side.
                  But otherwise—so important does she regard it not to leave those who so much need
                  her daily help—that she satisfies herself with this annual visit. Just in
                  proportion as it was waited for long, there was concentrated on it an intensity of
                  interest not easily conceived by those whose domestic enjoyment is more widely and
                  uniformly diffused. Beloved as she was by all the family, and specially the
                  younger portion of it, they could readily enter into and sympathize with her joy
                  on these occasions. Nor was the affection altogether disinterested. Young Ammon
                  was of a noble, generous nature, and if his education had been less thorough and
                  extensive than that of the pastor's sons, his disposition was so amiable, his
                  whole bearing so conciliatory, intrepid, and yet so discreet—his power in athletic
                  exercises and his skill in the sports and pastimes befitting his years, were all
                  adapted to make him the decided favorite, and to fix on him a large share of the
                  universal regard whenever he appeared at Brookdale.
               In age he was midway between the pastor's younger sons, and for reasons readily
                  understood he was most associated with Reuben. To the latter this annual coming of
                  Miss Ana's son was an occasion, which, in the monotony of his quiet life and few
                  associates, was most welcome. They could ride and walk, could labor and play,
                  could talk and sleep together. Ammon's vigorous arm would soon help Reuben to
                  accomplish his task—and then to the mountain or to the forest; or, with rude but
                  effective fishing-rods, they would betake
                  themselves to angling in the adjacent river. Once, when a powerful rain had
                  suddenly swollen this stream to turbid violence, sweeping before it every
                  obstruction, and in its rapid rush unsetting the pathway of their course, they
                  attempted to cross the fiercely-rolling billows on a bare and trembling tree-trunk
                  which stretched from shore to shore.
               Ammon led the way, and scarcely reached the opposite bank, when frightful was the
                  spectacle which presented itself as he turned to look back for his companion. His
                  less steady nerves had failed him at the trial, and midway over what threatened to
                  become his watery grave, his progress had been arrested—the dizzy swimming brain
                  had fairly incapacitated him to take a single step either backward or forward, and
                  each moment the slippery trembling log threatened to fail his foot-hold and
                  precipitate him amid rocks and yeasty foaming waters beneath. The cries of Reuben
                  were imploring; and in defiance of all peril to himself, Ammon hastened back, and
                  seizing his trembling comrade, bore him with incredible difficulty across the
                  dangerous pass. Fears of the parental chiding for such desperate risk incurred,
                  sealed their lips from all disclosure of this adventure. But it did not prevent
                  their joining with unwonted fervency in the good pastor's prayer that night, when
                  he thanked our heavenly Father for his kind, preserving care, guarding each one of
                  them from all perils and dangers through the day. As they retired to their chamber
                  both almost sobbed out the overflowing of their gratitude, and both, with a
                  tenderness and considerateness unusual for their years, spoke of the painfully
                  different scene which that night would have been witnessed in that dwelling, had
                  but another hair's breadth of increased
                  difficulty prevented the final rescue. Did the younger carry forward his thought,
                  and, in anticipation of what had been so nearly fatal to him, did he ask, 
                     
                        "Where, where would then my spirit be?
                        
                           How should I spend Eternity?"
                     
                  
               
               When God, by what we call accident, brings death so near to us, how
                  stupid it is, not to take a thought of what must follow death!
               Suggestions of this timely character were often addressed by Mrs. Jones to both of
                  these youth. Indeed, since religion with her was the principal thing, there were
                  never wanting fit occasions for her to utter its momentous lessons. Her Bible was
                  her daily counselor, her choicest friend. If you had looked in upon her, as she
                  sat at her loom, you would have seen the book of her choice opened before her, and
                  many of its golden truths did she thus treasure up in her memory. If the little
                  folks called in to see her on their way to school, to ask for a drink of water, or
                  hear her tell them a pretty story, she would reward them with the privilege of
                  reading to her a Psalm or a chapter out of her own Bible.
               But especially were her prayerful solicitudes drawn forth for this son of her
                  love, and for young Reuben, to whom, as a kind of foster-mother, she felt the
                  sincerest affection. Many were the tears and prayers which she and the good
                  pastor's wife mingled together for the salvation of their children. But their good
                  sense induced them rather to give the cheerful aspect of this matter to those who
                  were awakening in their bosoms so tender and deep a solicitude. As it was not
                  religion, but the want of it in these children, that made their parents sad, so it would have been the greatest
                  perversion to have carried the impression to their young minds, that religion only
                  or chiefly brought tears to their parents eyes, or sadness to their hearts.
               Nor did God leave this family unplied with other ministries, adapted to convince
                  them of His parental corrections. Once and again severe illness visited both the
                  sons that remained at home. The elder of them soon recovered, but Reuben was long
                  confined to his sick-bed. His mother's strength soon failed her, in the attempt to
                  nurse this youngest son, and thus was a double load thrown upon the patient and
                  ever faithful Mrs. Jones. By night and by day, all labors and cares requisite for
                  his comfort she cheerfully expended.
               Alas! how few but by experience know the amount of such requisitions, and when
                  they have passed by, how few adequately appreciate the obligation which they have
                  conferred.
               In this instance, perhaps there was not absolute ingratitude for such persevering
                  and long-continued favors. Mrs. Jones was regularly paid her small stipend, and
                  she was treated by all the family with a kindness and respect which seemed to
                  evince the depth and sincerity of their acknowledgment for her humble but
                  important services. But boys are apt to be thoughtless, and they soon forget the
                  cares and toils expended on them, either in their health or sickness.
               "Folly is bound up in the heart of a child," and how much, alas! of long-continued
                  discipline is required for its expulsion. Nor is it less obviously true that
                  "childhood and youth are vanity." The heart, estranged from God, will early prompt
                  the feet to turn aside from the ways of wisdom; and when gratitude to the great Giver of all good is habitually
                  repressed, what marvel if it be withheld from the instruments of His beneficence
                  with whom we are daily connected?
            
            
               PART II.
               
                  
                     How unsearchable are God's judgments, and His ways past finding out."
                  
               
               
                  TWELVE years had passed away since the beginning of our little
                  history. The pastor's second son had just become of age, and, as an adventurer,
                  had left the family circle. Reuben, now a dozen years old, though not a healthy,
                  was an almost overgrown boy, from frequent and severe illness rather
                  over-indulged, and not as yet able to do much in repaying the labors, cares and
                  anxieties which he had occasioned. Like many an invalid child becoming more dear
                  to parents and attendants by the extra watchfulness and toils which he had
                  occasioned, he was scarcely less endeared
                  to his unwearied attendant and nurse, Mrs. Jones. When she had once and again seen
                  him raised up from the borders of the grave in answer to her fervent prayers, and
                  had felt that her toils and vigils in his behalf had thus been amply recompensed,
                  it only awakened in her heart a more intense desire that his young heart might
                  yield to the demands of Heaven, and he no longer remain without a good hope
                  through grace. Gently, yet earnestly and frequently, she endeavored to impress on
                  his susceptible mind, the truths and obligations of religion. Sometimes he
                  appeared to feel and heed her entreaties. Especially now that an unwonted
                  affectionateness was manifested by her, in part occasioned by her son's just now
                  coming of age, and setting forth almost immediately for a tour, and a season's
                  labor in what was then deemed the far
                  West, it would be almost brutish in the boy to disregard the nearly
                  maternal yearnings of her pious desire for his salvation. Still the waywardness of
                  his youthful nature was becoming more and more manifest. He would sometimes seem
                  to trifle with her most earnest remonstrances, and with teasing 
                     supersciliousness
                     superciliousness
                  , rather than malicious ungodliness, he would not only ward off her
                  religious appeals, but appear to turn them into ridicule.
               The God against whose mercies he was thus hardening himself, now plied him with
                  other influences. Partly for the improvement of his wife's health, the pastor was
                  accustomed occasionally to take her with him in some of those official journeyings
                  which led him for days away from his home. An excursion of this kind had just been
                  planned, which both of them seemed to anticipate with unusual pleasure. An ordination, at which he was to
                  officiate, some thirty miles from his home, was to be followed the succeeding day
                  by another ecclesiastical convocation in a neighboring town, and they contrived
                  for a whole week, a succession of delightful services, interspersed with gentle
                  rides day after day. It happened, on the morning of their leaving home, and when
                  the careful mother was desirous of making over the supervision of her boy to his
                  Miss Ana, for the week, that more in mischievous frolic than with deliberate
                  naughtiness, he turned the seriousness of them both into ridicule. His buoyant
                  exuberance of spirits appeared for the time to defy control, and with a desperate
                  pertinacity he seemed bent on the indulgence of his sportive levity. Even when his
                  mother was entering her carriage, she once more called the gleeful boy to her
                  side, to draw from him the assurances she wished in regard to his deference to
                  Mrs. Jones while herself would be absent. But his waywardness even then, got the
                  better of his usual filial deference, and repeating some heartless joke, he
                  tripped away from her without the parting caress.
               The second morning after her departure, at a very early hour, Mrs. Jones gently
                  opened the door of his bed-room, and waked him by repeated, but cautious appeals.
                  When his eyes were fairly open and turned on her, the sad, but unusually calm and
                  studied aspect in which she stood gazing upon him, awakened first his curiosity
                  and then a more painful emotion. Guardedly, and with great deliberation, she
                  proceeded to inform him that during the dead hours of the night, while he had been
                  wrapped in unconscious slumber, a neighbor had aroused her to communicate unwelcome tidings, which she
                  thus related:
               "His dear parents had met with a sad accident. They were hurrying from their first
                  appointment in C——. When scarce a mile from the church, as they were descending a
                  hill, the harness gave way (or had not been properly secured), the carriage ran
                  upon the horse, and the frightened animal both ran and kicked violently, upsetting
                  their carriage and seriously injuring them both. Your father was considerably
                  bruised, but he was able to rise from the ground; and he found your mother"—here
                  the faithful creature was fairly choked, and for a moment could not go on with her
                  statement—"quite unable to rise, one of her limbs badly broken near to the body,
                  and in most excruciating pain she was carried into the nearest house."
               It was a sad morning to him. Unaccustomed customed to such affliction, to such
                  severity of physical anguish in the person of her whom he loved best, it would
                  have moved the most indifferent to witness the keenness of his sufferings. Very
                  interesting was the spectacle of that true-hearted attendant, the faithful Mrs.
                  Jones, striving to rise above the consideration of the sorrow which wrung her own
                  heart, in order to minister the soothings which her Christian piety and large
                  experience could suggest, to allay the intensity of his wild grief. "That mother,
                  from whom he had thus parted, so soon and so dreadfully a sufferer!
                  And was it for his sin that such an infliction had been laid on one of the
                  gentlest and best of earth?" Such were some of his severe self-upbraidings. His
                  faithful nurse, who knew how to minister to his mental suffering, as she often and
                  long had to his bodily diseases, judiciously refrained at this time from all direct allusion to his
                  misdeeds, and strove to turn his thoughts to those high and general considerations
                  of the wisdom and benevolence of God's dealings, whose equity is undeniable, even
                  when clouds and darkness are round about Him.
               Fortunate was it for Reuben that arrangements had immediately to be made for his
                  setting forth with his oldest brother and wife to visit these parents in their sad
                  affliction. The incidents of preparing for this journey diverted his mind from too
                  intensely poring over the occasion of it, and the next night they reached,
                  together, the scene of the late disaster. Yonder by the road side still stood the
                  broken carriage from which they had been thrown, near the rough rocks on which
                  that much loved mother had fallen with so disastrous effect. They enter the neat
                  but humble dwelling, and passing the ante-room room they reach the apartment where
                  the chief sufferers are found. The father they find sitting up, with his head
                  bound up, and still suffering from its contusions; and by his side, stretched on
                  that low bed lies the mother, more severely stricken. The first sympathetic
                  emotions occasioned by this meeting are over. Young Reuben begins to look around
                  him with more composure. He learns one by one the pangs and sorrows which that
                  fond parent has experienced. Especially on the second morning after his arrival,
                  when the surgeon, as was his practice on each alternate day, removed the bandages
                  from the broken limb and submitted it to the needful but intensely painful
                  friction, deemed by him indispensable to prevent soreness or want of healthful
                  circulation of the injured parts, the boy listened for the first time in his life
                  to the outburst, from maternal lips, of
                  those shrieks of bitter anguish which all her fortitude could not restrain. This,
                  not for an instant merely, but continued for successive moments, which seemed to
                  him like ages. As long as he could, he clung to her side, seemingly anxious to
                  lighten by sharing her pains. But overcome by the scene, he hurried from the
                  house, plunged into an adjacent grove, and even there, at a great distance, the
                  groans and almost screams of his mother's agony still followed him, and pierced,
                  not his ears only, but his very soul.
               An hour afterward he returned. She was lying exhausted, but comparatively free
                  from pain, upon her couch. She had wiped the tears from her eyes, and calling the
                  loving boy to her side, she pressed his head to her bosom, and with the warmth of
                  such love as a mother only can exercise, she seemed to reward him for the
                  tenderness of his sympathy with her sufferings.
               At a later hour, more probably for his gratification than her own, she allowed him
                  to busy himself for some time, in striving to clear the matted tresses of her
                  hair, and neatly complete the braids which platted it in more comely form. It was
                  while alone with her in this filial service, that, with most gentle and winning
                  sweetness, she inquired of him in regard to his treatment of his ever faithful
                  Miss Ana. Was it the overwhelming tenderness and power of his own emotions which
                  choked his utterance? Or did the same perverse spirit which produced his wrong
                  conduct partially regain ascendency? so as to prevent his falling on her neck, and
                  sobbing forth his penitent confession, as he had often on his knees done in
                  secret, for the last four days. Or was the perverse spirit of delay
                  whispering its delusive suggestions into his heart? "That when she should return
                  to his now so desolate home, there would
                  be a better time to convince her how truly and deeply he mourned over, how
                  sincerely he repented of the light-hearted folly which had given them so much
                  pain." Perhaps it was a combination of them all, which operated to prevent his
                  using this last favorable opportunity to give joy to that mother's heart. Seeing
                  that he hesitated to answer her inquiry, (and standing as he then did behind her,
                  she could not discern the depth of his manifested feeling), she contented herself
                  with the expression of her kind and earnest hope, that never would he again so
                  trifle with the sacred and deep solicitude for his religious welfare, of one who,
                  in her own feebleness, had been to him so nearly a mother: and others coming into
                  the apartment, the topic was not again resumed. Alas, what would not, this
                  inconsiderate boy have afterwards given for one moment's ment's opportunity to
                  have assured that mother of his sorrow, and sought her willing and ready
                  forgiveness.
               After some four days passed at his mother's bed-side, Reuben returned again to his
                  henceforth sad home. Three weeks had elapsed after the misfortune had befallen
                  them. His father, once and again, had returned for the performance of his official
                  duties: he was even now at his lonely home, and as all accounts of the speedy
                  convalescence of his wife were favorable, he began to encourage himself and his
                  now motherless household, that ere long he hoped to move back into her accustomed
                  place, her who had not only been the light of his dwelling, but the joy and solace
                  of all their hearts. The evening before, this had been the theme of his remark,
                  ere he bowed down for prayer with the now broken circle.
               In the morning, the pastor was early
                  hurried from home, for some secular business in the opposite direction from that
                  in which, at a later hour, he had hoped to set forth to visit his suffering
                  companion. Reuben, Mrs. Jones, and some other casual inmates of the abode, were
                  still in the breakfast room, when a stranger rode up, and inquiring if this was
                  the residence of the Rev. Mr. ——, received an affirmative answer, and immediately
                  dismounted and entered the dwelling. His look was a sad and weary one, and his
                  horse bore marks of rapid and long travel. When seated, he inquired very
                  deliberately and emphatically for the minister, or either of his sons.
               Young Reuben came forward, and received from the stranger an open letter,
                  addressed to his father. Hastily he glanced over the lines, written and signed by
                  the attending physician of his dear mother. They rather blindly intimated, than
                  clearly revealed the astounding fact, that at a late hour the previous evening the
                  pastor had experienced a great loss. A hasty perusal conveyed even to the mind of
                  the child the overwhelming tidings. For a moment he gazed in silence on the
                  messenger; then, calmly he asked, "does this mean that my mother is dead?" All
                  eyes were fixed on him who alone could give the required information. He felt the
                  painfulness of his duty, and for a moment his faltering tongue seemed unable to
                  perform its office. But dashing a tear from his manly cheek, he embraced the dear
                  boy in his arms, and falteringly said, "She will never thus clasp you more." That
                  day, and the following one, the house was indeed a Bochim, a place of tears.
               Then they brought her lifeless remains to her late cheerful dwelling. The widowed
                  father saw all his now motherless
                  children gathered there. Far and wide spread the mournful tidings, and through an
                  extensive circle of loving hearts the pang of grief for her sudden loss was
                     felt.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *She died of apoplexy, superinduced probably by her prostration, for so long
                     a period, by that broken limb.
               
               Then came the mournful funeral. The late autumnal rains were sending down a
                  copious flood—the withered leaves fell thick and fast, and through the bared
                  branches of forests and fruit trees the sighing winds breathed their sad requiem.
                  The holy man of God, the chief mourner's officiating brother, and one well able to
                  sympathise with his sorrows, stood up from the sacred desk to proclaim, "I heard a
                  voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, BLESSED ARE THE DEAD THAT DIE IN THE
                  LORD."
               Then despite the storm, a great throng gathered around the open coffin, to look
                  for the last time on the remains of her they had loved so well. A truer mourner
                  stood not among that multitude than weeping Mrs. Jones. For more than a dozen
                  years she had been the inseparable companion of the deceased in all the varied
                  circumstances of their condition through joy and sorrow. The power of that
                  Christian spirit which both had experienced and were enabled to illustrate had
                  made them one. In the different positions they occupied, each knew how to conduct
                  and feel toward the other; for the golden rule was their welcome guide. There had
                  been just those differences—not to say contrasts—in their temperaments, their
                  mental and moral training, and their position in life, which made the one the fit
                  complement of the other. What the one did not possess was found in the other, and
                  the willing coalescence seemed to imply that they had felt themselves selves mutually dependent, mutually incomplete, but
                  by union and co-operation with each other. When the bereaved family returned that
                  evening to their henceforth more desolate dwelling, the widowed father and
                  husband, by the soothing ministries of his official associates, had his heart
                  lifted above the crushing sorrows of the hour, to fix itself on the glorious
                  themes which, in like circumstances, he had proffered to those who were thus
                  stricken. The sons, too, felt that the full tide of generous gushing sympathy from
                  kindred and friends was warmly turned upon them. Reuben especially, as the only
                  one at home and not yet risen to manhood, shared more largely than the rest in
                  these soothing alleviations. But how few knew or cared to think of her sorrow, who
                  felt, not less keenly than any other, the overwhelming, stunning blow which had
                  fallen upon them all! Mrs. Jones, in the bustle of that scene, was to be called on
                  by every body and for every thing, a kind of factotum, who was expected to know and do whatever was required, and
                  whatever no one else could.
               Long, dismal, and comparatively cheerless was the winter which followed. By the
                  pastor's desire his eldest son and wife came to live with him and his bereaved
                  family. But so great was the contrast, to Mrs. Jones especially, between the
                  friend she had lost, and the young, gay, pleasure-loving woman, who,
                  notwithstanding the kindness of her heart, seemed to have no religious sympathies
                  and principles in harmony with her own, that the void was in no degree filled. The
                  words of christian hope and cheer which she had been accustomed to exchange with
                  her who had now passed away, could no longer be fittingly uttered or their response listened to. She knew there was
                  the same God and Father above, and to Him at least, in the privacy of her
                  retirement, she loved to pour out her soul. At the family altar, too, the morning
                  and evening offerings were constant and fervent. For poor, motherless Reuben she
                  felt, if possible, a warmer and livelier religious concern than ever before, and
                  many were the judicious efforts and friendly counsels with which she strove to
                  turn his young heart into the ways of early piety, that he might not forget his
                  sainted mother's God and Saviour. In the early days of his bereavement, she
                  noticed with joy that his heart seemed more impressible, his conscience more
                  tender, his will more disposed to bow to God's requirement. But youthful
                  associates, the scenes of gayety and thoughtlessness which were soon brought in
                  his way, and the proneness of the unrenewed renewed to relapse into more confirmed
                  waywardness,— 
                     
                        "When disappointment mocks the roving heart,
                        Still of its own delusions weakly fond,
                        And from forbidden pleasures loath to part,
                        Though shrinking oft beneath correction's keenest
                           smart."—
                     
                   was strikingly noticeable in the few months of his future progress.
               Gradually, but on the whole rapidly and fearfully, she noticed the deterioration
                  of his principles and practice. He was fast becoming a young man, and he no longer
                  listened so patiently or heeded so carefully the counsels and cautions which pious
                  lips and Christian hearts would gladly minister to him. He loved to debate, to
                  argue; sometimes beginning this from the mere spirit of opposition, and to see if
                  he could not confute the simple and pious with whom he was surrounded; and at
                  others from the unholy bias of a heart reluctantly yielding to or else beginning to spurn the restraints with which
                  he had hitherto felt himself encompassed.
               In this transition state, how hard for one over-vain of the incipient smartness
                  which he was now beginning to develop, and which the injudicious praised just
                  enough to fan the embers to a flame,—how difficult did Mrs. Jones find it, when
                  often she attempted to stem the tide of worldliness, and unholy compliance with
                  sinful practices and corrupting amusements. He was now beginning to feel the full
                  force of allurements to all the round of such youthful indulgences and pleasures.
                  She, who knew so well how they had been regarded by that now sainted mother, and
                  who felt continually the charge which those last audible accents had left on her
                  ear, "to guard her youngest from all evil," was now struggling with the
                  difficulties of her situation. Having no real authority, she could at most only
                  persuade; and she was often made to feel, alas, how sadly, that folly is bound up
                  in the heart of a child.
               Should she reiterate her remonstrances with an unwelcome pertinacity, thus
                  imperiling altogether her future influence? Or on the contrary should she timidly,
                  and she feared unfaithfully withhold her counsel, just when the crisis of a first
                  wrong decision was about to be consummated? With what deep solicitude did she
                  often carry these doubts and perplexities before the throne of grace, and plead
                  for that divine Wisdom which is alike profitable for this life and that which is
                  to come. How great the relief she here found, even in the most trying emergencies.
                  Did what she thought wrong, for the time prevail? undiscouraged by her apparent
                  failure, she would strengthen her heart, and hope, by pleading still the promise and covenant of Him who has never
                  said, Seek ye my face in vain. She knew that He had all hearts in His hand and
                  could turn them as the rivers of water are turned. That all events, even those
                  apparently the most untoward and discouraging, could yet be made under his wise
                  subordination, to minister to the good of the subject of her petitions. She
                  remembered sometimes with a cheering faith, how God dealt with the motherless
                  Joseph—-making the very means and instruments which apparently foretokened his
                  ruin, the mysterious steps of his ultimate advancement and success.
               It was evening at the pastor's dwelling—and as very often now happens, he is
                  absent. His son's wife, now assuming the place of mistress of the household, with
                  faithful Miss Ana for her helper, are together engaged in some of their usual
                  toils, and Reuben, as he was often wont, was sitting by them. A country ball, or
                  dancing party, had just been agreed on among his young associates, and he had been
                  solicited to join in it. Without any real love for such amusements, for the
                  enjoyment and participation in which his past staid and sober life had so little
                  fitted him, there was on his part an unwillingness to be deemed singular, or to be
                  so far separated from the blithesome and jocund companionship of his youthful
                  associates. He dreaded to be singular, and many a time, the fear that he should be
                  thought extra good and sober, because he was the parson's son, had induced him to
                  put on airs, and utter words of bravado savoring of impiety and irreligion. Should
                  he now evade his father's watchfulness, and stealthily hie away to the ball? This
                  was the grave question he is secretly revolving, and by some means his
                  sister-in-law has become aware of it. With her characteristic desire to please, more than to profit him, she introduces
                  the theme for discussion among those three only, with a tacit understanding that
                  her pious husband, and his father, the minister, should know nothing of what was
                  there said. The evident purpose of this conversation, then and there, was to bring
                  over, or silence "Widow Jones," as the young mistress called her, so that her
                  opposition might no longer lie in the way to his attendance.
               "What harm can there be in a little innocent dancing among young people?" said the
                  young, gay sister-in-law. "I am sure I do not think young people should always act
                  like old ones, and pretend to be sober and quiet when they do not feel like
                  it."
               Reuben chimed in most willingly, and stigmatized the scrupulosity which would
                  refuse such indulgences to the young. For his part he could see no use in it. He
                  wondered why the Christian people should so hate a little pleasurable
                  indulgence.
               The widow hesitated whether to say any thing; but as she could see by the
                  inquiring looks of both her companions, that they desired to draw out some
                  expression from her, and moreover feared that her silence would be taken for
                  assent, she meekly remarked that there were pleasures more secure from excess and
                  perversion, which afforded a higher and more permanent joy than dancing to the
                  sound of the viol, which the Scripture seemed to forbid.
               The pert boy thought this a good opportunity to evince his knowledge of Scripture
                  as well as his powers of argumentation, and, with some superciliousness, he
                  replied,—That he had read the Bible through, as she very well knew, and that he found more in favor of dancing than
                  against it. He even took down his father's Concordance from the book shelf, and
                  out of some two dozen places where the dance, or dances, or dancing were mentioned in all the Bible, he was very
                  sure that two to one commended it. David, the man after God's own heart, and
                  Solomon, the wisest man, and even the good father of the Prodigal Son, had all
                  practiced or promoted it. He looked very self-complacent after this learned array,
                  and said he should like to have Miss Ana, or any one else, show him the Scripture
                  authority for prohibiting dancing.
               She thought there was a great difference between David's dancing before the Lord
                  as a religious duty, and such frolics of the young as tended to exclude God from
                  their thoughts. And finally, she said that his deceased mother and herself self
                  had often spoken of that Scripture declaration, "Whatsoever is not of faith is
                  sin," as cutting up by the roots such levity as an immortal being, liable at any
                  moment to be summoned into eternity, could not consistently engage in. Turning on
                  him a look of utmost tenderness and kindness, she added, "that sainted mother has
                  nobler employment now, and such she sought with many prayers and tears for
                  you."
               This testimony was not lost upon the often wayward boy. He knew that his reprover
                  was right—that his mother had been right—that his father's desires for him, which
                  for the last half hour he had been planning to contravene, were also right, and
                  for this once, at least, his foolish thoughts of pleasure in the giddy mazes of
                  the dance were abandoned. This was only a specimen of the manner in which this
                  humble domestic, this real "help," as the
                  New Englanders often call those assistants in their families whom they would not
                  degrade by the name of servants, watched over the moral and religious
                  interests of this now motherless boy.
               Many months thus passed away, and then another change occurred in the pastor's
                  family. He brought home a new wife for himself, a new mother for Reuben, and a new
                  companion for Mrs. Jones. For weeks the two latter had been expecting this great
                  event. Busy tongues had been not sparingly suggesting to the overgrown boy, "Well,
                  you are to have a stepmother soon. She will make you know the difference between
                  her and your own mother." "You need not expect much indulgence or kindness
                  hereafter." These, with other intimations of the like character, just adapted to
                  fill his mind with unwelcome, misleading prejudices judices, were plentifully
                  urged on his attention. But in these unpropitious circumstances, how discreet and
                  faithful was the part acted by this foster-mother of his early years. Instead of
                  chiming in with such intimations as would alienate his regard, and even his filial
                  affection from one who came to meet with difficulties and trials not a few, in her
                  new and delicate position, Mrs. Jones seemed determined to see every thing in the
                  new comer through the most favorable medium. She had ready excuses for any thing
                  which seemed strange or wrong, and free and ready suggestions as to the advantages
                  which he would derive from this new relationship.
               Indeed, there was a demand for all these assiduous and kindly efforts on her part,
                  to smooth the way for him properly to respect, and much more to love; one who,
                  with many excellencies, was as unlike his
                  own now sainted mother, as it is possible two good women could be. The one had
                  been free and fond in all her intercourse with him, and all others who had just
                  claims to her kindly regards. Her successor, on the contrary, was reserved,
                  stately and chillingly cold in her manners. Somewhat exacting, too, he thought
                  her, both towards himself and his revered father. Suffice it to say, her
                  excellencies did not manifest themselves promptly. She might possibly have
                  affection, but she did not show it. She might be amiable and good, but he thought
                  the evidences of it did not appear. Many were the debates which he held with the
                  good "Miss Ana," in which she strove to convince him, and not altogether in vain,
                  that there was sterling worth, and a deep heart-full of kindness, even in that
                  precise and stately formalism, which seemed to lock itself up, and repress all the
                  outgushing of affection. Undemonstrative as were her ways, "depend on it, Reuben,
                  you will find her a good mother, it you will prove yourself a good son." With such
                  timely hints and assurances she was indeed performing for the youth an invaluable
                  service.
               In the mean time, the widow's heart was greatly exercised in regard to her only
                  son's course, and her own. Ammon had visited the fertile regions west of the
                  Alleghanies. For a considerable period he had labored there on good monthly wages,
                  but with the laudable ambition so uniformly characterizing the young New
                  Englander, he could no longer content himself without becoming the proprietor of a
                  farm. He noticed that some of his neighbors at the East, who had removed to the
                  virgin and productive soil of the Ohio valley and there purchased wild lands, and opened farms by their industry and
                  enterprise, were rapidly becoming forehanded, and had the fair prospect of soon
                  securing a reasonable independence for themselves and their families. No wonder
                  that the example was contagious. The young man wrote to his mother, begging her
                  approval and co-operation in his proposed enterprise. They could together secure a
                  section of rich land; his vigorous arm could clear off the forests, fence the
                  fields, and gather the bounteous harvests which were there yielded, and with
                  youthful, enthusiastic ardor, he portrayed the picture of their happiness and
                  success, when living together, she might be spared the severe toils for which, by
                  and by, in declining years, her strength would prove inadequate.
               All this she weighed with the prudent cautiousness for which she was so noted, but
                  she also took into account the heavyper contra
                  balance of which he seemed unmindful. In that new country, would she not of
                  necessity be cut off from her dearly loved religious privileges? Would not many
                  social and moral privations also be experienced in thus leaving the home of her
                  youth, and the friends of her love? She remembered that when Lot had preferred the
                  well-watered and fruitful plain, it had involved himself and family in the
                  corruption and peril of Sodom. The result of all her reflections induced her to
                  appeal to her son to return and dwell among their own kindred in dear New England.
                  And to make her proposition more welcome to him, she proffered him the handsome
                  amount of all her hard earnings and careful savings, about five hundred dollars,
                  to be invested by him in any way he thought best, if he would thus comply with her
                  wishes.
               
               The final decision was not made until after Ammon's return from the West. Then,
                  mother and son, in many a long and anxious interview, endeavored duly to weigh all
                  the counterbalancing considerations. Can it be doubted which scale would
                  preponderate? A loving mother's heart could not long hold out against the
                  enthusiastic ardor, which, even at that early day, the West, the mighty giant West
                  could enkindle. Ingenuously, too, he frankly confessed there was another
                  attraction for him towards the setting sun, in the person of a lovely young lady
                  there, with whom he had already formed most endearing ties of betrothal, and she
                  and her father's family were linked to that new and fruitful country. Of her he
                  spoke to his mother as an enamored lover would be sure to speak, assuring her of a
                  daughter's respect and love, and that it should be the sedulous endeavor of them
                  both, to make her home with them as happy and peaceful as she could desire.
               The die was cast, and the decision was soon and widely known. Very generally
                  useful had widow Jones made herself for all these years in that community; nor
                  could the kind-hearted neighbors think of parting with her, but with deep and
                  sincere regret. But the keenest pang was felt in the family she had so long and
                  faithfully served. Changed as that domestic circle was by the death of one and the
                  removal of others, the tie that bound her to them was less strong than at earlier
                  periods of her connection with them. She still revered the good pastor and his
                  fervent prayers; she much respected the new wife he had brought home; but towards
                  Reuben, whom she had nursed in infancy, and watched and cared for so anxiously in
                  sickness and infirm health for so many
                  years, and for whose spiritual welfare—especially since his mother's tragic
                  exit—she had felt an interest so deep and prayerful, her regards were of the most
                  tender and hallowed character. Should she leave him in person, she comforted
                  herself with the thought that however widely they might be sundered, her prayers
                  would still as perseveringly be offered in his behalf: and the God who hears and
                  answers the petitions put up to Him in faith, she could not believe would
                  disregard her own and the deceased mother's earnest cries for his salvation.
               It was in the early spring of 1814, on a pleasant morning of the verdant year, the
                  birds chanting forth their blithest notes, and all nature rejoicing in bright hope
                  and vigor, that a double wagon of peculiar construction, and freighted with the
                  choicest and most prized commodities, which would be of enhanced value in their
                  distant home, stood at the humble door of the parsonage. The hearty adieus, and
                  the mutually implored "God bless you" of all had been uttered, and the vigorous
                  hand of Ammon Jones with some difficulty held in the impatient and well-fed steeds
                  which were then the only reliance for accomplishing what the locomotive now does
                  for us with such vast increase of celerity and comfort; when his mother, turning
                  last of all to Reuben, took the boy's hand, and with an emotion which seemed to
                  pervade her whole frame, once more conjured him by all the sacred memories of the
                  past, and by his known sense of duty, to seek the Lord in youth, to serve Him all
                  his days, and to meet her and the departed in heaven. With convulsed and
                  overpowering feelings they parted, not expecting to meet again on earth.
               
               We will not here attempt the minute description of their experiences in that long
                  journey—then usually occupying from twenty-four to thirty days—and now with
                  incomparably greater ease accomplished in as many hours. No untoward event was
                  experienced by them, except some slight break-down in the mud they encountered
                  near Lake Erie, as they passed through Northern Pennsylvania.
               They reached, at length, the EL DORADO of their hopes and aims. Kind neighbors
                  gathered around them with interest, and helped them to rear the log-cabin which
                  was to form their incipient home. A slight opening in the deep forest of huge and
                  lofty trees had been made, the wheat crop, "got in" the last autumn, was now
                  springing up in rank luxuriance, the corn and the garden were planted, and in an
                  almost incredibly short period, appeared in vigorous, thrifty growth, giving
                  promise of ample recompense for their toil.
               But there were other and less favorable experiences before them. Rapacious beasts
                  of prey swarmed in the forest in such close proximity to their very door, that the
                  howling of wolves, the growl of the surly bear; and the screech of the American
                  panther were no unusual sounds in their ears even by day; while under the cover of
                  night's darkness they held high carnival all around their humble dwelling. Woe to
                  lambs, or calves, or poultry of any kind, not strongly defended against these
                  nocturnal invaders. Many a time when these domestic animals had been, as was
                  supposed, securely penned even adjoining their own cabin, the hungry wolves in
                  droves would attempt pulling down the very walls of these sheds, to get at their
                  victims, and with the utmost difficulty,
                  even by the rifle of young Jones, could they be driven back to their lairs.
               Nor, for the first years of their frontier life, were they entirely free from
                  visits of more formidable foes. True, victories of Perry on the lake, and of
                  General Harrison on land, had struck terror into the tribes of the tawny savages;
                  but straggling bands, or wily scouts of these treacherous, and often drunken and
                  ferocious red skins, were still prowling around the sparse settlements of the
                  whites, exciting alarm where they did not commit depredation or murder. How far
                  off, too, in any case of difficulty, were their nearest neighbors. A mile or two,
                  through roads nearly impassible, on account of dense and tangled forests, and
                  almost unfathomable mud, had often to be traversed to reach the nearest
                  habitation. But, ere long, Ammon brought home his bride, fulfilling thus his
                  promise to give a daughter to his fond mother, to cheer her heart in this
                  wilderness life. And though they were far from the house of the Lord, and for
                  years rarely could welcome the approach, or listen to the accents of the
                  messengers of salvation, she remembered with satisfaction, that the God and
                  Saviour we worship is not confined to dedicated sanctuaries. 
                     
                        "Where'er we seek Him, He is found
                        And every place is hallowed ground.
                        For He, within no walls confined,
                        Inhabiteth the humble mind."
                     
                  
               
               This humility, and the spirit of true and warm devotion, she habitually cherished.
                  How unspeakable was her satisfaction, even in these far-off places of the
                  wilderness, to hallow the Christian Sabbath, and sound forth in her sweet and trustful notes of praise, the honor of
                  the divine Redeemer. The well-worn Bible, which, in former years she had so much
                  read and prized, became now dearer to her than ever. And when at distant
                  intervals, a pious neighbor, or some chance traveler who knew and loved the Lord,
                  could pass an hour or a night beneath their humble roof, how like cold water to a
                  thirsty soul, were the moments of converse with them on the themes dearest to her
                  heart, and now, all the more prized because of their infrequency.
               Cares, also, of another kind began to increase upon her. Children's children were
                  speedily multiplied, bringing, indeed, no little augmentation to her toil and
                  watchfulness by day and by night; but bringing, also, their own sweet and
                  appropriate remuneration to a loving heart.
            
            
               PART III.
               
                  
                     
                        "There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
                        Rough hew them as we may."
                     
                  
               
               
                  QUARTER of a century has passed since the events last chronicled in
                  our little history occurred. Many of the individuals mentioned in this narrative,
                  had finished their earthly course, and the simple incidents of our story had
                  nearly faded from memory. Near the close of summer, in the year 1840, a middle
                  aged man of thoughtful aspect, and in clerical dress, was seen very early in the
                  morning entering the stage, whose destination—marked upon its panel—was the
                  southern portion of one of our Western States. He has been spending the last few days as the welcome and honored
                  guest among sundry families, who, years before, had taken their departure from his
                  and their native town in far-off New England. Having had occasion to perform some
                  official anniversary service at a distinguished university, which brought him
                  nearer than ever before to the world-renowned cataract of Niagara, he hastened
                  thither to fill his mind and heart with those ennobling emotions which the
                  contemplation of God's handiwork rarely fails to inspire. Then the idea suddenly
                  possessed him to wend his way still further West and look at the beloved neighbors
                  and fellow-townsmen of his youth, in their new homes. Reaching them unexpectedly,
                  and bringing large stores of treasured memories, and recent tidings of the dear
                  ones they had left behind them, he became, not less for his own sake, than for
                  these adjuncts of his visit, a highly-esteemed and warmly-welcomed guest. From
                  house to house, from one new home to another, he was carried in a kind of princely
                  state, witnessing, with wonder and delight, the progress which each household had
                  made in subduing the wilderness, and spreading around them the sources of comfort,
                  of affluence, and even of almost sumptuous gratification.
               He wished to extend his tour a day's ride or two, to meet other loved objects of
                  his former spiritual care, near the southern border of the State, and for this
                  purpose, ere the sun had risen, he took his seat in the stage above-mentioned.
               But many a day, opening auspiciously, is clouded soon with unexpected reverses.
                  Our traveler, not unlikely, had indulged over-freely in the fine fruits which, in
                  such abundance, the teeming fertility of this virgin soil had yielded, and in
                     rapidly passing from one to another of
                  these old neighbors, each had insisted that he must eat of their pears, and
                  peaches, and melons, and the hot-house grapes, whose luscious clusters invited to
                  a generous participation. Suffice it to say, the feverish unrest of the night
                  followed him from the pillow to the stage; his whole frame seemed pervaded with
                  the encroachments of severe disease. The reeling, dizzy brain, the fevered lip,
                  the bloodshot eye, the nausea, and the writhings of spasmodic pain, all conspired
                  to invest his situation with untold horrors. The stage became overcrowded, and the
                  day, as it advanced, proved intensely warm. In the early part of it, while
                  ascending the long hills, or when stopping for change of horses, our passenger
                  attempted to walk forward, and, by vigorous exercise, to throw off, in healthy
                  perspiration, the oppression, so unusual, which now encompassed and pervaded him.
                  It was in vain. And equally futile were all endeavors, at the little hostleries
                  where they from time to time stopped, to obtain any medicinal remedies adapted to
                  his necessities. In this most unwelcome condition, each passing hour of endurance
                  but adding to and rendering more intense his sufferings, the day was slowly
                  advancing, till the meridian was considerably passed. Bitter and desponding
                  thoughts began to oppress his mind. Should he succumb to this attack, and, at some
                  dwelling by the road-side, lay himself down to die, as the lamented Grimké, a few
                  years earlier, and in the same vicinity had done?*
                   He thought of his pleasant and far-off
                  
                      *T. S. GRIMKÉ, one of the distinguished men of South Carolina, as a
                        legislator, a reformer, a scholar; who, after delivering the discourse on
                        American Education, before the Western Literary Institute, at Cincinnati,
                        died of cholera at a house by the road-side, on his way to Columbus,
                        October, 1834.
                  
                   home, of wife and children whom he might see no more, and again and again
                  nerved himself, with all the power he could command, to resist these downward and
                  fatal tendencies. But each rally, each attempt to call up the reserved forces
                  within him, became weaker and weaker; and revolting and painful as was the
                  thought, he felt that he must yield and seek the friendly shelter of some dwelling
                  ere insensibility should utterly prostrate him. They were passing an unpretentious
                  but somewhat ample house, and here he prevailed on the stageman to leave him, to
                  live or die, as God should direct. His baggage was deposited by the gate-way, and
                  with tottering steps he gained the door, explained his condition to the surprised
                  inmates of the abode, and bespoke, as best he could, their compassionate
                  hospitalities. They neither granted nor denied his request,
                  
                     "And with tottering steps he gained the door." Page 85.
                   but seemed considerately to regard his distressed circumstances, only
                  the female members of the house being present; and the good house-wife saying she
                  would send to the field for her husband to decide what should be done; while, in
                  the meantime, the sick man was seeking to accommodate himself to the unwelcome
                  delay.
               At just this crisis of his fate, there entered the apartment, from an inner door,
                  an aged and matronly looking woman, evidently a member of the household. A little
                  below the medium height, of remarkably quiet demeanor, there was yet a steady
                  persistence in all her bearing which at once indicated that she was no cipher in
                  their domestic establishment. Briefly, the mistress of the mansion explained to
                  "grandmother," as she respectfully called her, the condition of the suffering
                  stranger, and his eyes imploringly met
                  the old lady's for the first time. He thought there was wondrous depth and meaning
                  in the gaze with which she now regarded him, and as in slow and carefully measured
                  tones she uttered some inquiries for the further elucidation of his case, a sudden
                  conviction seemed to flash upon the minds of both of them. For a moment only he
                  hesitated. What he had thought, was, indeed, almost too good to be true, and yet
                  as he scanned again those small, bright, twinkling eyes, that sedate form, that
                  peculiar utterance, he could doubt no longer. It was, it must be, his own and
                  early loved "Miss Ana." He rose with difficulty, and staggered to her side; he
                  grasped the outstretched hands, while she, half bewildered, cried out, "Can this
                  be Reuben?"
               All uncertainties in regard to his reception were at an end in a moment. He found
                  himself conducted to their best chamber, and at once surrounded by all the
                  ministries of affectionate, devoted regard. In the midst of these arrangements
                  Ammon's tall form appeared, as in his rough farming attire he had hurried to the
                  house on the first summons. He was less altered in his aspect than his more
                  wrinkled mother; and the sick man was very sure that he should have recognized
                  this playmate of his youth under any circumstances. Esq. Jones, as he was now
                  usually called, from having honorably filled a magistrate's office for years in
                  that community, though himself a very unostentatious man, was now prodigal of his
                  attentions. The best medical advice and aid attainable were at once procured, and
                  all the members of the family vied with each other in rendering the prompt and
                  efficient assistance which the circumstances ces demanded. Above all, the faithful nurse and
                  attendant of his early years, this foster-mother, as he loved to call her, was
                  most unremitting and earnest in her present devotedness to the sick man's
                  necessities. She immediately took possession of the chamber nearest his own; she
                  directed, or herself performed whatever her own skill in attendance on the sick
                  had taught her was most conducive to his welfare. As she bathed his feet, or
                  cooled his burning brow, or chafed his temples, or ministered to him the needful
                  medicines prescribed, how vividly did it impress on both of them the remembrance
                  of similar offices which she had performed for him in childhood, a third of a
                  century ago. No language can adequately describe the persevering fidelity and
                  womanly skill and tact of her attentions. Watching both by day and by night, and,
                  with quiet efficiency, seeing that nothing was left uncared for, her noiseless
                  step, her gentle hand and voice, and loving heart, anticipated his necessities,
                  and soothed the perturbed and anxious spirit to repose. That upturned, heavenly
                  countenance of hers, which seemed instinct with pious confidence in God, showed
                  plainly where were all her trust and hope. But a few days elapsed before his case
                  had reached and passed its crisis, and slowly he began to amend. Their mutual joy
                  in this happy result was unutterable. That family of his, whom he lately thought
                  would see his face no more, would now scarcely hear of his danger e'er their
                  anxieties would be relieved by the assurance of his decided convalescence.
               These loving and long lost friends of his youth, also, would not, as they had
                  feared, only find him to make for him an early grave, far from his kindred. No, by the good hand of his God and theirs,
                  upon their earnest endeavors, he was to be restored to health and usefulness
                  again, to reward their pious assiduities by pointing them to the divine and only
                  efficient HEALER.
               After a short time, his recovery became almost as rapid as had been his
                  prostration. To Mrs. Jones and himself, those days of recovering mercy, when they
                  could uninterruptedly sit for hours, side by side, and mutually rehearse the way
                  in which the Lord had graciously led them, were indeed seasons of richest
                  spiritual enjoyment, calling forth devout thanksgiving unto God. She told him ail
                  the long and varied story of her removal to the wilderness, her privations and
                  exposures, her vigils and toils. How grievously she had, for a time, mourned over
                  the loss of religious associates and privileges, and how, one by one, the Saviour
                  in whom she confided, had been pleased to supply one after another these
                  deficiencies. The heralds of the Cross had been encouraged by her pious
                  steadfastness and hopefulness, in part, at least, to set up their banners on that
                  new field; and amid the log dwellings of the pioneers, as they gathered the little
                  companies of those who feared and loved the Lord, and their voices went up to Him
                  in praise and prayer, while the old forests around them re-echoed their songs of
                  lofty cheer, God bowed His gracious heavens and came down, making the place of His
                  feet glorious. She told how, even there, far away from any consecrated shrines of
                  worship, in their rude and humble dwellings, or under the shade of the primeval
                  trees, when they gathered for His worship, His Spirit came with sweet refreshing
                  on the souls of the believers, and carried conviction, too, to the hearts of the unrenewed. There, and in such
                  circumstances, she had years, before, seen her only son, and then his wife, and
                  more lately some of their dear children, whom she had nursed with a mother's love,
                  and strove to train in the way of piety, giving their hearts to the Redeemer.
                  These were her compensations for all her sacrifices, and were they not enough?
                  With devout thankfulness she lifted her tear-dimmed eyes to heaven and said, "O
                  yes, I can praise my God and Saviour forever, for these tokens of His infinite and
                  unmerited love!"
               Together that interesting family bowed morning and evening around their domestic
                  altar, and joined the voices of young and old in the sweet hymns of praise for the
                  divine goodness. As strength increased they walked out together. She, now nearly
                  three-score and ten years of age, with her staff in her hand, would often pause to
                  point out the localities around their pleasant home which had been made memorable
                  by peculiar joys or sorrows. On the border of that wood, not very remote from
                  their dwelling, her son had been almost killed by accident, when felling the giant
                  trees of the forest. And there she had erected in her heart a monument of praise
                  for God's deliverance of his invaluable life. Yonder, just over the hill, in a
                  dwelling of one of the neighbors, where they had gathered for worship in former
                  years, while she was sitting on the rude board-seats arranged for the assembly,
                  her foot had been dreadfully crushed by the frail support of that seat giving way,
                  and bringing down all its heavy load on, her unconsciously exposed limb. For days,
                  weeks, yea months, the agony to her was indescribable; far greater than
                     amputation tion would have caused; but
                  patiently she bore all, and was rewarded, as she said, with a foot recovered, much
                  better to her than none, or one of wood or cork.
               A whole chapter or two might be interestingly filled with the gathering up of her
                  incidental communications in those few days, supplemented and confirmed as they
                  were, by what the kind-hearted grateful neighbors testified in her behalf, both as
                  to her influence in her own family, or more widely in the little community around,
                  where, for more than a quarter of a century, she had been a kind of moral and
                  religious nucleus, around which the successive strata had gathered and formed
                  themselves to the shape and spirit of her example. Modestly, and with becoming
                  self-renunciation of all praise to herself, she spoke of the way in which God had
                  led her all her days; and specially of the many lessons she had learned in that
                  half a usual generation's length of years which she had passed under the roof of
                  the pastor at Brookdale, as, under God, the means of her preparation for the
                  important part which she had been forced to act on the new theater of her recent
                  residence.
               Recalling to Reuben's mind the books she had read in that little family library of
                  the good pastor, the principles on which himself and his companion acted in
                  rearing their own family, and as far as possible leading the neighbors and the
                  entire community around them to be sober-minded, temperate in all things;
                  industrious, frugal, and above all, God-fearing, and Christ-honoring, in heart and
                  life, these these, said she with emphasis, have done so much to make
                  my son's house happy and blessed, and to spread through the neighborhood of
                  Bruceville the germs of order, success,
                  and comfort. No wonder her influence there had become great. Having been planted
                  there in the very beginning of the settlement, and for the most part having
                  enjoyed uniform health, there was scarce a family in the whole vicinity to whom
                  she had not hastened in their sickness, rendering them most welcome and important
                  help, when no other could be procured. She loved the children whom she had nursed
                  and cared for from their birth, and both children and their grateful parents
                  remembered her great kindness to them in their hour of utmost need.
                  Unostentatious, and never unduly assuming, she did not obtrude officiously her
                  opinions or advice; but when the occasion demanded she was outspoken and decided;
                  and her opinions on moral and religious, as well as domestic matters, were widely
                  and greatly respected. "Why do you not ask Mother Jones?" became the common
                  inquiry in all questions of importance, within her sphere. The commanding
                  influence, and the blameless and highly honored character of her son, Esq. Jones,
                  was enhanced by his connection with her; and then, in turn, it helped to add its
                  own increment to her reputation. "See," said the neighbors, "what her pious
                  consistency has wrought in making that family of his such patterns as they
                  are!"
               Not a judicious, upright decision did the magistrate give, in cases litigated
                  before him, nor a successful effort did he volunteer as peace-maker among
                  wrangling neighbors, but what reflected honor on his mother's influence.
               It would have been passing strange, while Reuben had been gathering up all these
                  testimonies in favor of one to whom he owed so much, if she, on her part, had
                  failed to elicit from him, what his pious
                  gratitude was prompt to acknowledge, what her forming influence had enabled him to
                  accomplish. Little by little, she drew from him the main story of his life. How,
                  the very next year after she had left him, so earnestly invoking on him, in the
                  parting moment, the blessings which hers and his mother's prayers had sought for
                  him, he had given his heart to God, and one year later, had been sent forth by his
                  honored father's consent and aid, to prepare for usefulness as an ambassador of
                  Christ. How, also, very early in his course of study, his begun career came near
                  terminating by the death of his next older brother, who had just then finished his
                  studies, and "with the ardor of a seraph" began to preach the gospel, only to find
                  his course cut short by quick consumption, and in five months his body was laid in
                  the grave. As this was attributed tributed to the deleterious influence of severe
                  study on his before noble frame, great was the demur whether or not to arrest the
                  course of young Reuben, even at the threshold, lest he should in the same way be
                  sacrificed, and thus bring down the gray hairs of his father to a sorrowful grave.
                  Then he told her how better counsels finally prevailed, helping him to complete
                  his preparations; how God had graciously blessed his labors for near a score of
                  years, in country and city churches where he had been pastor, enabling him to lead
                  many hundreds to put on Christ in the pathway of discipleship; as she had herself
                  done long before by his honored father's hand. Only two months before, his
                  happiness had culminated in the conversion and addition to his church of his two
                  eldest children. How, in fine, that father of his yet lived, between eighty and
                  ninety years old, able, occasionally,
                  to lead the flock he had cared for so long, and especially able, as all his
                  acquaintances said, to lead with unsurpassed appropriateness and pathos their
                  devotions on those funeral occasions when any of his associates in earlier years,
                  like the withered leaves of autumn, fell before the driving blast. As these
                  several reminiscences of their early years' connection were one by one rehearsed
                  to her, the excellent woman would again and again exclaim, "O how wonderful has
                  been God's goodness!" With some little remains of the womanly, perhaps laudable,
                  pride of early years, she seemed to rejoice in all the tokens of public approval
                  which had gathered around "this boy of her early care." His honor and renown,
                  whenever he had reached the high places of the field and won a generous meed of
                  public approbation, she traced, in part, at least, under the wonder-working
                  providence and grace of God, to what she and his mother had done and sought for
                  him.
               Soon as he was possibly able to officiate, the neighbors were all notified to
                  attend a lecture in the school house near Esq. Jones' residence. It was enough to
                  be told that one so nearly a son of the honored mother of the settlement would
                  there address them, to fill the room at an early hour; and from lips which she had
                  so often moistened when parched in fever, she now heard the words of life and
                  salvation. Nor was this all. The communion Sabbath of the little church was near
                  at hand. Reuben's strength, as they all thought, was not fully enough recovered
                  for him safely to set out on his homeward journey, and he must remain to gratify
                  all their wishes by aiding their stated supply on that important occasion. When
                  this was finally agreed on, the notices
                  tices went forth very widely, over hillsides and valleys, over prairies and
                  through incipient villages already springing up in that newly settled country.
               The auspicious day at length arrived. Its bright sunlight spread over the lawn,
                  and at an early hour the family were all astir for the needful preparation. The
                  younger members on horseback, or on foot, or in humbler vehicles, took their way
                  to the appointed place, while the carriage of Esq. Jones was filled by himself and
                  wife, with his mother and the preacher. Long years had passed since they had rode
                  to the house of God in company, and far the larger portion of the companions of
                  their early years were with the dead. Scarcely could either of them realize that
                  this was more than dream. The two miles which they traversed, furnished, at almost
                  every step, some pleasant and grateful recollection, First, they passed for a
                  considerable distance through the noble domain, the spacious fields of her son.
                  Many of them he had reclaimed by hard and diligent toil from their native
                  wildness, and the remainder he had annexed by purchase. As now they were covered
                  over with his flocks and herds, or by the lofty and intensely verdant and
                  dense-growing Indian corn, or showing the golden stubble whence the wheat-harvest
                  had just been gathered, how natural that a sense of the divine goodness vouchsafed
                  to them, should fill their glad hearts. Into all this joy their guest entered most
                  cordially. The happy groups of young men and maidens whom they passed on the right
                  hand and the left, all hieing to the sanctuary, appeared to look up to them with a
                  very unusual interest. Their meaning glances of recognition seemed almost audibly
                  to say, "This distinguished preacher, whom all are so eagerly pressing to hear, is only the result
                  of Mother Jones' faithful, early training."
               What then were her emotions when once and again she heard him, to the dense throng
                  of the great congregation, preach that gospel, which so often and so far away she
                  had heard from his father's pulpit. When, too, from his hand she received the
                  symbols of her gracious Saviour's broken body and running blood, penetrated with
                  holy gratitude, did not her heart, if not her lips, that day cry out, "Now let me
                  depart in peace, O Lord, for my eyes have seen thy salvation?" Happy, thrice happy
                  and blest was she, in being permitted thus to see the fruit of her prayers and
                  early counsels made useful to her neighbors and friends.
               The evening of that very day, after a leave-taking as tender, and solemn, and
                  joyful, as their late meeting had been unexpected and opportune, one of the noble
                  sons of Esq. Jones, took Reuben a few miles on his way to spend the night with
                  other pious friends of the cause of Christ and of that dear family. This, too, had
                  all been arranged by the considerate wisdom of this foster-mother, who, for good
                  reasons, well understood by herself alone, had planned for one of her grandsons,
                  this final privilege of a ride, and a confidential interview with one whom the
                  whole family so much regarded. What was her motive for this sequestered
                  intercourse between them? Why, this young man had but lately given his heart to
                  the Saviour, and already felt—as none but his good grandmother knew—the intense
                  longings of holy desire to give himself to the public service of the Lord. Will
                  they not, said she to herself, find out by a kind of mutual tual instinct, this great theme of such
                  transcendent interest and importance to the dear youth, and will not God bless to
                  him the counsels of one whose own similar experience must have prepared him to
                  sympathize with these youthful and hallowed aspirations? So, indeed, it fell out.
                  As they rode on their way, in answer (who can doubt it?) to her prayers, this very
                  topic was introduced: the timid ingenuousness of the young heart, warmly throbbing
                  with love to the Saviour, in whom he had so recently believed, was laid open,
                  little by little, to this recent stranger: and counsels adapted to his case were
                  freely tendered and as gratefully received. On the young man's return to his home,
                  not long were the two together, before he had told his honored grandmother all.
                  How fully their recent guest had entered into and sympathized with all his own
                  feelings of solicitude on the great question of his life-labor; and with what
                  carefulness he had sought to guide his inexperienced feet in right and safe paths.
                  Again did this good mother in Israel lift up her withered hands to heaven, and
                  with tears of pious thankfulness exclaim, "This, too, is of the goodness of the
                  Lord." "Was it for this," she asked, "that God, in part, at least, had brought him
                  hither, that another might be helped on his way in taking up his cross and leaving
                  all to follow Christ? So," thought she, "when, ere long, I lay down this silvered
                  head of mine in the grave, another who has been dandled on my knees, and given to
                  God's service in my early prayers for his consecration to this great work, may
                  rise up and go forth in this or in heathen lands, to preach the unsearchable
                  riches of Christ."
            
            
               
               PART IV.
               
                  
                     
                        "Think you that raptured soul
                        Now walking humbly in the golden streets
                        Bearing the precious burden of a love
                        Too great for utterance, or with hushed heart
                        Drinking the music of the ransomed throng,
                        Counts death an evil? No!"
                     
                  
               
               
                  IT pleased her heavenly Father to spare the honored life of widow
                  Jones to the extreme old age of nearly eighty-five, or fifteen years after the
                  events last recorded. And while little of startling interest occurred in that
                  comparatively peaceful period, there was still such alternation in her varied and
                  sometimes trying experiences, so much of the rich grace of the gospel did she
                  share and exemplify, that we may profitably trace, very briefly, her subsequent
                  career.
               In the earlier portion of these declining years, she still insisted on taking her
                  full share in the family cares and toils. It was indeed no longer necessary. Her
                  son had been so prospered, and the children, even the youngest of them, were so
                  fully grown, as no longer to make the large demand on her industry and
                  watchfulness which they had formerly. But, "cleanliness and industry are next to
                  godliness," was the motto which this good mother had early learned, and if rarely
                  repeated by her lips, it had a significant enforcement in her daily life. From
                  long and uniform practice these habits had become to her a second nature. And when
                  that noble son and his wife would sometimes say to her, "Mother, why do you
                  continue to rise so early, and insist on sharing still all the more burdensome
                  toils and duties of the household?" he would quickly remark mark, "Somebody must do all this, and my comfort
                  and happiness are rather increased than diminished by what I do."
               Rising with the sun in summer, and long before his appearance in winter, she made
                  her own apartment the neat and welcome place which it always appeared, and then
                  would see to it that all the members of the family were assisted, so far as
                  requisite, in their respective duties, so that in an orderly, quiet manner they
                  might be ready for the breakfast and the season of family worship which
                  immediately followed. Not a little of the happiness, and the mutual respect, and
                  active good will of that numerous house. hold of parents, children and servants,
                  were the direct result of this good order. They did not know its source—did not
                  probably even surmise that what all the family so much enjoyed, what made this
                  dwelling so welcome a home to the permanent or casual inmates,—was
                  directly traceable to the steadfast fidelity in waiting on the Lord, which was
                  there witnessed. And then again this steady, and orderly, and happy morning
                  communion with God, was, more than they suspected, the result of her resolute
                  carefulness that all should be ready in time for it; so that without; hurry or
                  confusion, it might prove to every one of them the sweetest and most hallowed hour
                  of the whole day.
               That now venerable woman had known by painful contact in all her earlier years,
                  how desolate and cheerless are the dwellings where God is not honored. She had
                  felt the bitterness in body and soul of constant exposure to the fitful rule and
                  wild disorder, the harsh dissonance and oft-recurring broils and outbursts of
                  unholy passion, where master and mistress have no fear of God nor love to the Saviour, no tender meltings of heart in
                  bowing at the mercy seat, and no suitable considerateness of the wants and woes of
                  orphan children parceled out among those whose tender mercies are cruel, and whose
                  hard service is a bondage grievous as the Egyptian task-masters. The vindictive
                  passion, the outbursts of violence, the harsh and causeless chidings, and the
                  brutal blows under which her young frame had quivered and smarted, and her spirit
                  often sank in almost hopeless despair, she still remembered; and as she thought of
                  the happy years which succeeded under the roof of the pious pastor at Brookdale,
                  where God was always honored, and the morning and evening incense went up from
                  their domestic altar, she would inevitably draw the just conclusion, that surely
                  God does, even in this life, pour out His indignation on the families that call
                  not on His name while his rich blessing is on them that honor Him. She thought of
                  the happiness resulting to parents and children together, when the words which God
                  has taught us are treasured in our hearts, and taught diligently unto our
                  children, talking of them when sitting in our houses, and when walking by the way,
                  when we lie down, and when we rise up. Psalm xcii.
               In the amusements and relaxations necessary for us, but which are so often
                  perverted as to become scenes of disorder, breaking in most fatally on the
                  regulations of a well-ordered family, she evinced her true knowledge of human
                  nature, and the proper place to fix the limits of indulgence. She loved to
                  witness, and even minister to the gleeful hilarity and joyousness of young hearts,
                  full to repletion of the outbursting spirit of freedom. When the allotted tasks of toil or of
                  study had been successfully completed, how sweet the smile that said from under
                  that tidy cap, and out of those bright twinkling eyes and healthful lips, "Now go
                  and enjoy yourselves." Well-regulated and properly limited mirthfulness, the
                  happy, side-shaking laugh, the vigorous athletic sports, and specially the joyous
                  songs of children and youth were sweet music to her old ears, and by cherishing a
                  love for these sports and innocent pastimes of the young, in her own family and
                  neighborhood, she helped to keep her own heart young also. "Wrinkles will come
                  upon my face, age will thin and blanch my locks," said she, "but my care shall be,
                  long as possible to keep the former from my heart, and let the sweet sunshine of
                  loving kindness still encircle my brows." To this was it doubtless owing, in a
                  very great degree, that all the children still loved and clung to her. It was one
                  of their choicest treats to be allowed to sit in her room, to hear her stories,
                  and look at the pictures she so carefully preserved, and hear her words of kind
                  encouragement, or needed counsel.
               One of the first abiding infirmities of her old age, was the loss of hearing. It
                  was not sudden and total; but gradually, and, on the whole, pretty fast, she felt
                  the loss of listening to the sweet and gentle tones of love in their natural
                  utterances, and those who would make her hear them, were obliged to give unusual
                  force and distinctness to their expressions. As this increased from year to year,
                  she was soon unable to gather instruction from the ministrations of the sanctuary,
                  and as the family was numerous, and all could not well go at once so great a
                  distance, she, with that beautiful
                  considerateness which always characterized her, would insist on remaining at home,
                  that her seat in the carriage, and then in the house of prayer, might be occupied
                  by some who could more profit by these privileges. Greatly as she had always
                  enjoyed the sound of a preached gospel, of the voice of public prayer and praise
                  before, and unwelcome as must have been the privation of listening to the ordinary
                  conversations of the loved ones in their family circle, it is not recollected that
                  she ever, for one moment, either murmured or complained. The same genial smile
                  irradiated her countenance, responding to each friendly look given her, and she
                  seemed inclined all the more gratefully to prize her almost undimmed eyesight, and
                  her powers of easy and quick locomotion. What a lesson to all! Instead of repining
                  for the loss of something dear, but which God in wisdom has removed, to estimate
                  more highly and justly the mercies still vouchsafed to us. The Bible and hymn
                  book, with Baxter's Saints' Rest, and Burder's Sermons for the Aged, were now
                  invested with new interest and attraction. As she read, very often would she be
                  marking the passages which appeared to her most striking, and she would point them
                  out for reading to the dear friends who came in, and loved to sit by her side,
                  indicating how sweetly they had relished to her.
               Among the rest of her visitors, her dear boy Reuben, as she loved to call him,
                  though residing many hundred miles from her, made it in his way two or three times
                  to visit her. He came always unexpected, unannounced; for the sake of the joyful
                  surprise which he knew his entrance among them would awaken, and specially to the
                  loving heart of this true mother. His
                  father and then his stepmother had died soon after his first visit to Bruceville,
                  so that really there was no one on earth now seeming to him so truly his own
                  parent as this loving foster-mother. He soon found, too, that by a slow and
                  distinct utterance, his voice on rather a high key, would penetrate even her dull
                  ears, so that for hours together they could carry on pleasant conversation. How
                  naturally her mind, especially in his presence, was continually running back to
                  the scenes, the characters and events of their early history! Many of her earnest
                  inquiries after the welfare of early friends, more especially their religious
                  welfare, he was enabled to answer to her great satisfaction, and this again called
                  forth their united praise to God. He, too, could read her favorite books, and the
                  choicest parts of them which she had specially marked for him, so that she could
                  well understand, and thus they enjoyed them together, each finding their own
                  satisfaction enhanced by this reflex influence of a common joy. Together they
                  attempted singing some of the dear old hymns, such favorites with them both, and
                  with others now passed into the skies, near half a century before. But her voice
                  had become harsh and strong, as is the usual result of deafness, instead of
                  evincing the musical sweetness of former days, and this exercise was not long
                  persevered in. But in family worship she could hear his voice by kneeling just
                  before him, and the satisfaction which this union of soul brought to both of them
                  was unspeakable. The tears of holy gratitude would then dim her eye, and add new
                  interest to all her features.
               He had considerately brought for her gratification whatever he thought would be most acceptable to her. Not one of
                  his gifts, even the most costly, did she so much prize, however, as the New
                  Testament and Psalms printed specially for the aged, in type so large and fair,
                  that, old as she was, it enabled her to dispense with spectacles in their perusal;
                  so light, too, in their thin, elastic covers, that her hand was never weary in
                  holding them. Again and again would she press the open books to her bosom, and in
                  strong, loud utterances, cry out, "These, these are my treasures; and
                  when you have to go away I can keep them and read them still. These words of Jesus
                  and these Psalms of David! how marvelously rich they are in their teachings, and
                  their comforts, too. I can well understand his meaning where he says, 'Thy words
                  have I taken as a heritage forever, and they are the rejoicing of my heart.'"
               Nor were they limited altogether to these indoor enjoyments. Her eye was still
                  bright, her step was firm, and her health was excellent, and on a fine vernal
                  morning or evening she loved to go forth leaning on the arm of her son, or Reuben,
                  as with stalwart vigor they still loved to feel the pressure of such a burden. How
                  sweet the perfume of the early flowers, how bright the verdure which carpeted the
                  earth, how gorgeous the bloom of fruit trees in their exuberant blossoms! The
                  garden, the lawn, the fields, covered over with flocks and herds, how did they all
                  appeal to her heart, and they found there a ready response. She quoted no poetry,
                  but she felt all and more than all that bards have sung, or the eloquent
                  interpreters of nature have ever reached in their loftiest and most impassioned
                  eulogies. Her own heavenly Father had made even His footstool thus resplendent. What then must be His throne! If
                  such were the joys of her pilgrimage, what must be her home!
               But other and sadder 
                     ministeries
                     ministries
                   were also plied by the All-wise disposer to loosen the ties which bound
                  her to the world. One after another, half that precious family were called before
                  her to that spirit world "where our best friends our kindred dwell, where God our
                  Saviour reigns." First, two of the grandchildren, the loveliest and dearest, as
                  doting parents are ever wont to think when death sets his mark on them, were
                  removed. But grandmother said, "The great Proprietor came into His own enclosure
                  and plucked for Himself—ah, why should he not?—the ripest sweetest fruits." With
                  holy equanimity of soul she was enabled cheerfully to give them up to Him who had
                  redeemed them.
               Next came a sorer trial. The strong staff of her earthly support was also broken.
                  That son, that only son, for whom and with whom she had so long lived, in the
                  fullness of his manly strength and ripened wisdom, on whom the eye and heart, not
                  of the family alone, but of the church, where, as an office-bearer, he was
                  honored; of the community, where, as a good magistrate he so efficiently and
                  widely promoted the public welfare, so confidingly vested, was now removed by
                  death. It was no sudden fearful casualty smiting down their hope in a moment
                  unexpected, but fatal disease fixed its tenacious grasp on him, nor would relax
                  its hold. He felt that he must die, and ordering wisely and well all his earthly
                  interests, he committed himself and the weeping, loving group around him to the
                  widow's God, the Father of the fatherless, and fell asleep in Jesus. The mother
                  stood by, who had borne him in her
                  heart's core from his birth, and for near fifty years, amid all changes had clung
                  to him so fondly, and with such exulting gratitude and joy. But she utters no
                  complaint. Tears, not of bitterness, but of holy joy flowed freely, as looking up
                  to Him whom she adored, she tremblingly cried, "Father, not as I will, but as Thou
                  wilt. Father, Thy will be done! The cup which Thou givest me, shall I not drink
                  it?" He, the great Healer, Comforter and Guide, bound up her bleeding heart,
                  whispered His words of gracious promise to her faith, and led her unfalteringly
                  towards her loved rest.
               No long interval elapsed ere that same group gathered around the dying bed of her
                  daughter-in-law, following so soon the husband of her love, to the spirit world.
                  Again did this doubly bereaved family look to her, whose counsels, and examples,
                  and prayers they had always enjoyed joyed, nor did they look in vain. She survived
                  these great changes long enough to evince before them all, for their instruction
                  and their comfort, too, how perfectly adapted is the religion of Christ for every
                  exigency. Her heart was not congealed by all its desolating experiences. Her eye
                  was not deadened to the scenes and claims around her. True, the heart did yearn
                  more fondly for the complement of its full joy in other and brighter scenes, and
                  the eye instinctively turned its gaze upward more fondly and frequently. Yet was
                  she still the same loving, wise, and faithful friend to all these orphan children,
                  which she had ever been, and nobly did their hearts reciprocate her love.
               Once more did Reuben, now past his meridian, and full of pressing cares, find his
                  way to greet her in what he feared might be her loneliness and desolation. Just look once more upon the simple
                  scene. It is a lovely morning of the earliest summer, and she has been for just a
                  little while left sole mistress of the dwelling. The son who inherits the paternal
                  mansion, and with it the blest privilege of caring for grandmother's welfare, had
                  not yet brought home his lovely bride, and depended on a house-keeper, herself the
                  mother of a dear babe which she brought with her. To-day they had left, for an
                  hour or two, that babe under the faithful care of grandmother, while other
                  avocations called them from home. She drew the cradle near the door, where she was
                  sitting, with her back to the street entrance. Reuben had reached the premises
                  unperceived by her. Seeing her well-known form, and her employment in hushing the
                  little one, he passed the gate, and stood upon the threshold, his traveling-bag in
                  hand. His shadow, in full and accurate outline with this accompaniment, fell on
                  the floor before her, and scarcely looking up, in her loud peculiar voice she
                  said, "They are all from home, you can have no trade to-day," supposing she was
                  replying to a peddler soliciting the purchase of his trinkets. But still he stood
                  there, as if immovably charmed and fastened to the spot, till again she repeated,
                  in louder tones, her refusal of what she thought his importunate proffer. Still,
                  as the shadow lingered, and she wondered that he did not leave, she rose and
                  looked upon him, recognizing in full, the love that brought him to her side.
               This ludicrous scene, at his entrance, gave both of them a hearty laugh, and
                  prepared them, as one extreme leads to another, for the tender and mournful review
                  of sad scenes which both had passed through since they had last met. "You seem quite lonesome here, mother," said
                  Reuben, in the loud tones requisite to make her hear. "Yes, yes," she responded,
                  "they all think it very lonesome, but I am used to it; to me it is not unwelcome.
                  My thoughts, my heart are no longer so much tied to the world. More easy I now
                  find it to commune with God my Saviour, and think of the many mansions in His
                  Father's house. He said He would go and prepare a place for His followers, and
                  would come and receive them unto Himself, that where He is, they may be forever. I
                  would not, indeed, be impatient, for it is good to wait the Lord's time, to do and
                  suffer all His holy will. But I am so glad that the time of my departure is near. 
                     
                        "'O who would live alway away from his God—
                        Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode.
                        Where rivers of pleasure flow o'er the bright plains,
                        And the noontide of glory eternally reigns;
                     
                     
                        "'Where the saints of all ages in harmony meet,
                        Their Saviour and brethren transported to greet;
                        While anthems of rapture unceasingly roll,
                        And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul!'"
                     
                  
               
               The slow loud utterance, by her, of these stanzas, seemed greatly to affect the
                  heart of Reuben. Tears unconsciously, but plentifully were bedewing his cheeks,
                  and her still quick and bright eyes detected them. Grasping his hand warmly, her
                  inquiring look said, "Why should such a prospect make one weep?" Not unwillingly
                  he told her that those words which she had just repeated awakened in his bosom the
                  memory of their frequent utterance in the well known duet which his daughters
                  played and sung together so often, and with such tender and hallowed joy, both to
                  themselves and others. But God had taken the ripest to Himself—and the now lonely
                  survivor, so often choking with fond, sad recollections, when asked for this or other music she had been wont to give
                  with such effect by the aid of the deceased, now answered with a sigh, "The sweet
                  harmony is gone! and my lone notes are too mournful."
               "Oh tell me," said Mother Jones with great earnestness, "tell me all about your
                  stricken lamb—her life, her death, her last utterances ere she winged her way to
                  Jesus' bosom." So earnest and persistent was her importunity, enforced as it was
                  by the argument that not often could she at all hear the voices of those around
                  her, while his was quite audible; and by the further assurance, that such
                  rehearsals were now to her ear and heart more welcome than all others; "not sad,
                  not gloomy," said she, "but rather inspiring, full of heartfelt joy," that refusal
                  was impossible. Thus entreated, how could he deny any effort for her gratification
                  cation? Drawing his seat very near to her, he gave the following
               
                  
                     
                        
                           STORY OF EMILY.
                           From earliest childhood, she had evinced unusual tenacity of purpose.
                              Whatever she undertook, whether work or play, whether study or music,
                              she gave her whole heart to it. Often so abstracted did she seem as to
                              give no heed to passing occurrences. With this was combined what
                              seemed stubbornness of temper. She had occasioned her parents and
                              teachers more trouble, in this respect, than all their other children.
                              Yet there was ever in her a nobleness, a conscientiousness, and an
                              abhorrence of whatever was mean, dissembling, or allied to tricky
                              artifice. Her truthfulness was always reliable, and to promises she
                              had made, her fidelity was steadfast and unimpeachable. Without the
                                 versatility which is
                              often so charming, she had made uncommon progress in whatever she
                              undertook. Her mastery of language, especially, was very unusual for
                              her years.
                           Before she was fourteen her mind became deeply exercised on personal
                              religion. She was deeply and thoroughly convinced of her sinfulness in
                              God's sight; and in the depth of contrition she loathed and abhorred
                              herself. The public appeal which just then fell on her ear from a
                              youthful ambassador of Christ, to "make one honest effort" to
                              surrender her soul to Jesus, and trust Him entirely and forever, was
                              blessed of the Holy Spirit. She yielded her young heart to the
                              requirements of the gospel, and became a consistent disciple of the
                              Saviour. It might be expected that religion, grafted on such a stock,
                              would bear its noblest fruit. Lovely and blessed was the influence
                              which she ever afterwards exerted. In the school among her fellow
                              pupils, in the female prayer meeting, where those mature in age and
                              piety marveled at the petitions they heard from her childlike lips, in
                              the church of God and her Bible class, where her example and profiting
                              were so noticeable, she evinced the power of that matchless grace of
                              the Saviour which had made her its trophy. Ere long it pleased her
                              heavenly Father to try her faith. She was laid on a sick bed, and for
                              many days her life was nearly despaired of. How serene and unclouded,
                              how firm and unshrinking was then her trust in the divine promises.
                              Her heavenly serenity said loudly to all beholders, "Though He slay
                              me, yet will I trust in Him." This scene of suffering occurred in the
                              house of her maternal grandfather, where she was born; and very
                              powerful and salutary seemed its influence on the rugged but noble
                              nature of that doting,
                              kind-hearted old man. It pleased God, however, after the light had
                              been flickering in the socket for several anxious days, to recover her
                              to comfortable, but not robust health. In this state she visited among
                              early friends, at a distance from her home, and here too her influence
                              was blessed.
                           Thus was she, for nearly four years, a growing, happy Christian. The
                              light and joy of the home circle which she graced with heavenly
                              sweetness, she was scarcely less beloved and honored wherever her
                              unobtrusive pathway led her. Personal charms, all too winning, were
                              developing themselves in her, combined with the nobler graces of
                              heavenly origin. Once and again had her hand been sought, by those to
                              whom she could not be entirely indifferent. But in full harmony with
                              parental counsels, she said, "It is too early too decide in questions
                              so momentous tous." A third appeal, having the advantage of almost
                              daily intercourse, and enforced by the most solemn and earnest
                              assurances that only by her influence the loving one might be led to
                              the Saviour, she at length yielded to, and before completing her
                              eighteenth year, in mid-winter of 1844, was married. How well she
                              filled the important post of mistress of a family—how far she exceeded
                              the fondest expectations of her friends in all the capability there
                              evinced, need not be here described. Effectually and promptly had she
                              won the hearts of her husband's kindred, in their commanding and
                              dignified positions. Most of all was her unobtrusive piety still
                              noticeable. Each morning in their dwelling, the Word of God was
                              devoutly read together by the entire household; and at evening she and
                              her husband bowed in prayer together in her chamber, making the
                              apartment the hallowed
                              lowed threshold of heaven. How rare the combination of meekness and
                              dignity which shone forth in all her deportment. The books she read,
                              the letters and journal she wrote, the visits she received or
                              returned, as well as all her daily intercourse with either friends or
                              strangers, savored of her communion with the skies.
                           Near mid-autumn, her father was required to set forth on a long and
                              perilous journey through the entire western States, to occupy five
                              months. The Sabbath evening before his departure, Emily spent with him
                              in his own family circle. As usual they read, and sang, and prayed,
                              her voice, a beautiful soprano, giving its richness to the favorite
                              sacred airs in which they united. The beautiful sermon of Robert Hall,
                              from the appropriate promise by the prophet Moses, Deut. xxxii. 25,
                                 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days,
                              so shall thystrength be, was read and remarked on, more
                              perhaps with reference to his anticipated perils in this journey, than
                              to that of those he left behind him. She evinced the utmost
                              cheerfulness; spoke freely and lovingly to that fond father of her
                              great enjoyments in her new home, and poured into his willing ear the
                              thrilling joys she still anticipated. There was just enough of pensive
                              sadness, by the expected separation for so many weeks, to give keener
                              and more chastened enjoyment to the hour, and he had never, perhaps,
                              looked on that circle with a tenderer and more joyous heart.
                           Before the next sunrise, he was on his way. One or two letters from
                              home had met him on his wandering course, and little more than three
                              weeks had elapsed after his departure, before one from his son-in-law,
                              reaching him in middle Tennessee, told him of the premature
                                 accouchment couchment of
                              his daughter, and that mother and babe were then doing well. He
                              responded at once, with fear and trembling, lest the daughter, and now
                              a mother, should prove too frail for such an exigency. More than a
                              week elapsed before he reached St. Louis, where his next letters were
                              to reach him. With intensest impatience he broke the seal, to learn
                              from the attending physician, that puerperal fever had supervened; in
                              the not unusual delirium which ensued, most anxiously and repeatedly
                              had the poor sufferer cried out for her father—her father. "Why do you
                              not send for him, for certainly he would come to his dying Emily?"
                           This, too, was accompanied by an intimation from the kind physician
                              that nothing would so likely avail for her recovery as the soothing
                              influence of that father's presence and prayers. This had been written
                              some ten days already, and he was more than one thousand miles from
                              her. How torturing the suspense! But the next day brought the dreaded
                              tidings. The struggle was over, and the poor sufferer had departed.
                              But her reason had been fully restored before the closing scene. When
                              told that she was thought to be dying, after affectionate and pious
                              counsels and adieus to those present, she left for the absent one this
                              message, "When dear father comes, tell him not to grieve for his
                              Emily. I shall soon meet him; perhaps I shall see him first." Then
                              closing her eyes she whispered audibly and calmly, "I shall soon rest
                              in the Saviour's bosom, and with the holy angels." A beloved Christian
                              brother knelt by her dying bed, and breathed a fervent prayer. When in
                              the conclusion he entreated the Father of mercies to sustain and
                              comfort that stricken absent father, whom the young sufferer had so tenderly loved, she clasped
                              her hands and uttered a fervent "Amen!" This was her last word.
                        
                     
                  
               
               When Reuben had completed the narrative, widow Jones exclaimed, "And I too can
                  join in that amen! May my own departure, which now must be very near, be like that
                  of this holy child of yours. What has the world to offer, comparable with such an
                  exit, in prospect of the home, the bliss, the Saviour's embrace, which she
                  realized?"
               By a natural transition this led her to recapitulate many of the interesting
                  incidents connected with the sickness and death of her own children, and
                  children's children. These were widely varied, indeed, as must be expected; but
                  all were strikingly evincive of the faithfulness of the Good Shepherd, who
                  verifies to such His own precious promise, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake
                  thee."
               Oh how sinful and ungrateful would it be for me," she exclaimed, with earnestness,
                  "to doubt His loving-kindness to me, after all which He has thus permitted me to
                  witness and experience!" And then in the strong voice to which all had been
                  accustomed to hear her in these latter years of imperfect hearing, she broke forth
                  in singing the familiar stanza, 
                     
                        "His love in times past forbids me to think
                        He will leave me at last in trouble to sink;
                        Each sweet Ebenezer I have in review,
                        Confirms His good pleasure to help me quite through."
                     
                  
               
               Toward evening they walked forth a little distance from the dwelling, enjoying to
                  the full the beauty of the vernal year. The clustering fruit trees were just
                  scattering their fragrant and variously tinted blossoms, like snow flakes
                     covering the ground at their feet;
                  and the sweet notes of the wild birds filled the air with their melody, while the
                  honey bees hastening with their nectar sweets to their hives, sent forth a subdued
                  hum not ungrateful to the ear. Leaning on Reuben's arm, she slowly led the way
                  toward the resting place of the dead, but said with a cheerful smile, "I do not as
                  was said of Mary, 'Go unto the grave to weep there.' No, thank God, I can rejoice
                  rather. For the unslumbering eye of Him who watches over the dust of those who
                  sleep in Jesus, will well perform its office till the archangel's voice shall call
                  them from their sleep. Here beside my kindred would I too find a resting place for
                  this poor old worn out frame. But my soul will fly away and join the redeemed in
                  their white robes, and help them sing their new song of praise to our glorious
                  Saviour."
               And so, ere many months elapsed, she did. Her final illness was neither long nor
                  painful. She welcomed, with thankfulness, the kindly ministries of her physician,
                  and nurse, and grandchildren; she was remarkably quiet, evinced no impatience, and
                  seemed to lie passive in the Lord's hands to be disposed of as He saw fit. But the
                  eye, the heart were evidently above, and He whom she had waited for, came and
                  received her into His own presence, to go no more out forever. There, in that
                  humble cemetery, rest her remains with those of her son and other kindred; and
                  those among survivors who knew her best, will most honor and revere her
                  memory.
               The condensed facts of our little history are completed, and they scarce need the
                  formal pointing of their important lesson. Fully do they confirm and illustrate the position, that not high rank or
                  favored external circumstances are essential to true worth, or even to extensive
                  usefulness. When many of the titled dignitaries of earth shall have passed to the
                  oblivion they have merited, and others who have won brief plaudits by unworthy
                  means, and have, as rapidly as they rose, sunk away to deserved forgetfulness,
                  some, like this pious Emigrant's Mother, by well filling their humble stations,
                  and honoring the Lord in all their ways, shall live in the hallowed memory of
                  future generations, fulfilling thus the divine promise,
               "Surely the righteous shall be in ever-lasting remembrance."
