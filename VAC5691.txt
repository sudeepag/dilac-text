            PREFACE.
            MANY of the incidents of the following narrative have fallen under the observation of
               the writer, and others have been related by actors in the scenes. They have been
               woven into a simple, truthful story with the design of imparting a lesson, and
               strengthening generous sentiments. Some of the characters will at once be recognized
               by their friends. In an itinerant's life there may be darker shades than are here
               depicted; but I have generally preferred the sunnier aspect, in the full persuasion
               that my object will be better accomplished by presenting models for imitation, rather
               than characters that might awaken abhorrence only, and leave the reader no better. I
               have not written in vain, if the profession and exercise of the Christian graces
               shall become more emphatically the pursuit of life; if the thoughts suggested by the
               perusal of this book awaken in any heart an increased love of goodness, or a desire
               to do good to all; and, especially, if the Christian ministry shall be more highly
               honored and better sustained.

            INTRODUCTION.
            TRUE, beautifully true, will, we think be the pronunciamento passed by its readers
               upon this little narrative. Not that it consists of literal historical fact; but
               that, like our Saviour's parables, under an external imaginative form it encompass a
                  true principle, and a power of producing a true
               impression. Many of the apologues of the great Teacher were not individual facts,
               that could be said to have occurred at some particular time; but general
               representation of what is always occurring. And so of this little life-parable of our
               present day. It perhaps did not transire under the same name, in the same order of
               events; but it is what is constantly transpiring—happening every hour of the day in
               every part of our land, under every variety of name. It is a true picture. But every
               picture drawn by an actual painter's genius
               is, in a measure, a pleasant deception. It simulates itself to be what it is not; and
               the more perfect the semblance, the more completely it can make your
               imagination conceive it to be what it simulates, the
               sweeter the rapture you feel, and the higher the price you will pay, not for
               falsehood, but for the reality, which can alone be most truly presented by truthful
               fiction. Nay, if it be, say, the portrait of some hitherto unseen personage, or a
               sketch of some unvisited scene, then, the more complete the painter's deceptive
               skill, the more true is the knowledge of the originals imparted to your mind. And
               thereby the slightest visible sketch not only attracts a more ready attention, but
               conveys a more accurate idea, and carries that true idea into thousands of quarters
               for which the very truest written discourse would have no power or chance.
            No ministry of any Protestant Church is called upon to make such sacrifices as the
               itinerancy of Methodism. At its very entrance there is a self-surrender, hardly to be
               paralleled by any lay profession, certainly unparalleled in any other ministry. It
               may be easily shown how this surrender of local home and worldly resources subjects
               to a countless number of privations and trials unknown to a settled pastorate. Yet
               how immensely those privations may be increased or diminished by a countless number
               of little things on the part of the Church, is seldom thought by our people. How
               truly there is a right way and a wrong way of dealing with a pastor; how perfectly
               easy the right way is, if only sought; and how much better, even for the Church
               itself, it is, if adopted, are seldom realized as they should be. Sermons and
               dissertations are dry and ineffective modes of making these truths seen and felt; but
               here is a picture of the whole thing. Look at it; is it not entertaining? Is it not
               true? What, then, is the lesson? And what must be our future doings?
            If this little book can win its way to the attention of our people—if it can only
               awaken their minds to a study of the proper mode of lessening the trials of a class
               of good-doing, God-serving, world-saving men—a great object will be attained by a
               small instrument. Meantime there is room for the labor of further talent in the same
               field. This little book has wrought but a small part of the rich subject. If its
               success shall encourage the author, or its example shall awaken some other hand to
                  draw a completer picture of our pastoral
               life—its relations to the people, and of the people to it; to show the trials and
               duties of each to the other, and so bring them to a better understanding—it will
               accomplish much. There is room for showing in a most telling way, the reasons in
               which our "peculiar institutions" are founded, the rational call they make for
               self-sacrificing concession from every part of the Church, the immense importance of
               bringing our life up to the pattern set forth in our system, the wondrous results of
               its past history, and the still more wonderful results yet descried in the future by
               the eye of faith, provided always the spirit of our system shall live in the practice
               of our people. May God's blessing rest upon the work in its little mission, and upon
               the readers who receive its sayings.

               ONE fine morning in April, just before the bell sounded five, you might have seen
                  numerous persons, alone and in groups, wending their way through the streets of a
                  large town. The bright lights of one of the churches were already shedding a warm
                  brilliancy over pulpit chancel, and orchestra; and, peering through the lattices
                  into the dim distance, seemed to invite all within the hallowed precincts.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *See Frontispiece.
               
               And the multitudes entered there, gliding to their places cheerfully and
                  noiselessly. The smile of recognition, the whispered "Good-morning morning," and the archly spoken, "You here so
                  early?" were exchanged.
               A scene of no ordinary interest is at hand. The members of one of the Annual
                  Conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church are assembled at the close of their
                  session; and the "appointments" are about to be read. The decisive hour is
                  come—the hour that will bear upon the future of the ministers of the Gospel
                  present, upon their families, and upon their respective fields of labor.
               Perhaps you would have heard, occasionally, a suppressed sigh, and a scarcely
                  audible prayer for Divine assistance. A sad, earnest face you might have seen,
                  here and there. The quivering lip and the trembling eyelid told of mental
                  conflict, of heart-struggles, "The past lives over again in its effects."
               The countenances of most were placid and contemplative, and glowing with trusting
                  confidence and Divine love. A trace of heaven was on them. In whatever direction
                  you turned your eye, you would have beheld features full of animation that
                  revealed a power and a will to do, and a fixed determination to press right onward
                  in the path of duty.
               Now they all stand. Mellow voices softened to plaintiveness, and anon rolling out
                  in full, triumphant strains, blend as they sing Wesley's hymn: 
                     
                        "And let our bodies part,
                        To diff'rent climes repair;
                        Inseparably join'd in heart
                        The friends of Jesus are.
                     
                     
                        "O let us still proceed
                        In Jesus' work below;
                        And following our triumphant Head,
                        To further conquests go.
                     
                     
                        "The vineyard of the Lord
                        Before his laborers lies;
                        And lo! we see the vast reward
                        Which waits us in the skies.
                     
                     
                        "O let our heart and mind
                        Continually ascend,
                        That haven of repose to find,
                        Where all our labors end;
                     
                     
                        "Where all our tolls are o'er,
                        Our suff'ring and our pain:
                        Who meet on that eternal shore,
                        Shall never part again."
                     
                  
               
               Their emotions rise with the sentiments of the hymn, even to the last line; and
                  now each heart glows with a fresh
                  inspiration, and future toils, privations, and conflicts dwindle to a mere point
                  in their existence; a point that will soon be passed. The land of rest and of
                  victory appeared to the eye of faith in full view. Then prayer followed—prayer
                  deep, earnest, availing; and when that large assembly arose from their devotions,
                  it seemed as if the angel of the covenant and of peace had spread his wings over
                  them, and had breathed upon the hearts of his messengers as he flew onward.
               The appointments were then read slowly and distinctly. The suspense of one and
                  another, and another is ended, until each knows his destination, and has a
                  vineyard allotted to him to cultivate.
               The bishop addressed them in a few earnest, soul-stirring words, which inspired
                  all hearts afresh with zeal, and hope, and courage. Then his blessing fell upon
                  them benignly; and the veteran, wayworn and warworn, but triumphant in a hundred
                  battles—the self-reliant, wholly reliant, strong in nerve and muscle, who had
                  wielded a victorious blade in recent combat, and the young soldier, just bravely
                  binding on the Gospel armor, eager to do valiant service for the Kings of kings,
                  all bowed their heads reverently to receive its soothing, hallowed influences, and
                  the conference was closed.
               A hearty grasping of hands, congratulations, commiserations playfully proffered,
                  encouragements, and hurried farewells are exchanged; the concourse is dispersed,
                  and before the sun sets many a Gospel hero will be upon a new battle-field.

                           From age to age in virtue strong,
                           Inured to stand and suffer wrong.

               WE will accompany one of the number; that tall, dark-eyed man, now in the prime of
                  life, who is hurrying away to be in time for the morning train. It is the Rev.
                  Samuel Arthur, bound for his now appointment a hundred miles away in the
                  country.
               He is now seated in the car, and apparently lost in thought. The years of his
                  ministry are passing in review; his successes and his discouragements come back
                  upon his memory. He thoughtfully brings to mind his mistakes and failures, and the
                  prayer of Solomon arises to his lips: "O Lord my God, give thy servant an
                  understanding heart." He reviews his opportunities for mental improvement also.
                  Starry dawn and the midnight hour had found him in his study.
               The past year had been one of incessant toil. The society for whom he had labored
                  was new and few in numbers, and generally faltering in faith. Consequently he had
                  been compelled to bear their burdens in addition to his own. Thus his study hours
                  had been much interrupted, and the thought of his beloved companion, feeble and
                  faint from effort and exhaustion, had often forced him from his books, upon which,
                  in his perplexities, he had in vain been striving to fix his thoughts.
               His cheerfully proffered attentions had strengthened her for renewed effort, and
                  her grateful smile was a ray of sunshine in his heart. She had toiled on
                  trustingly, growing paler and paler every day, but with an undaunted,
                  uncomplaining spirit, until she had nearly sacrificed her life in her efforts for
                  her husband, her children and the society of which he was pastor.
               Even with studied economy the receipts of each quarter had fallen below their
                  expenditures, and to the sensitive spirit of the minister's wife it seemed, in
                  some cases at least, that what had been received had been afforded grudgingly.
               Then his wealthy neighbor, Mr. Wardlow, a
                  member of his Church, and both leader and steward, came unbidden to his
                  recollections. This man had given him a cool reception; and though his income was
                  counted by thousands, yet he had continually annoyed the minister with fears of
                  pressure in their finances. His ever ready text was, "The poverty of our society,
                  and the necessity of bringing the preacher's salary down to the lowest prescribed
                  limits;" and upon this subject he waxed eloquent.
               The bare tithe of this wealthy man's income—and what Bible sanction has any man
                  for placing his standard below this? what Christian, indeed, is
                  willing to give less than the least of all Jews?—would have sustained
                  preaching in his Church; and the bestowment of it would have opened and softened
                  his own heart, and brought richest blessings upon him and upon his family.
               And the minister thought long and deeply, until reflection became a burden; and
                  then he turned his heart to Heaven. Spirit communion soothed and comforted
                  him.
               A grassy, hill-side, a murmuring brook, waving Pines, and beneath one of them a
                  little mound, newly made, now rise before his view. There he had left, in the
                  keeping of the Great Shepherd, a lamb from his own fold. Sadly had the little
                  footfall, the silvery voice, and the light and joyousness of the precious one
                  been, missed; but he had learned to think more frequently of a fairer clime, a
                  clearer sky, and a purer communion. "A Sabbath, now came over his mind; and his
                  face lighted up with a glory of thanks and prayer."
               His thoughts then rushed on to his new station; and conflicts, victories, trials,
                  and seasons of rejoicing were anticipated, and his heart grew strong in the
                  consciousness that he was in the path of duty. Hope now pointed to golden harps,
                  and palms, and crowns; and his good angel beckoned him onward, and pointed upward,
                  until the triumph of faith was complete, and, like an apostle, he exclaimed: "I
                  count not my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and
                  the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the
                  grace of God."
               The meditations of the minister were now interrupted; he had arrived at the end of
                  his journey.
               Farmer Hatfield was moving with a quick step and a scrutinizing glance among the
                  passengers, as the stepped from the, cars, and he soon caught sight of the
                  clergyman. He was not certain that the
                  Conference would close, or the minister arrive that day; but he thought it a
                  pleasure to ride over and see. A greater pleasure truly, the good farmer
                  considered it, than it would be to the minister to arrive stranger, and be
                  compelled to hunt up lodgings.
               A great heart lodged in Mr. Hatfield's breast; a heart of the deepest, tenderest
                  sympathies. He felt sensibly the unpleasantness, of the minister's position among
                  a people with whom he was entirely unacquainted; and said that, should everything
                  be done to make his coming among them agreeable, there would still be many
                  circumstances connected with his first appearance among them, from which a
                  sensitive mind would shrink.
               The farmer's family entered fully into the feelings and views of the noble-hearted
                  man and though the minister's arrival would be somewhat unexpected, they would
                  make his coming none the less pleasant.
               As the clergyman and Mr. Hatfield approached the farm-house, Dwight, the farmer's
                  son, a bright boy of seven summers, bounded into the room where his mother and
                  sisters were sitting, and sung out at the top of his voice, "O, he's come! he's
                  come! the new minister has come!" and he threw his cap "sky high," and capered
                  about the room in great glee.
               Mrs. Hatfield and her daughters arose and met them at the front door. The
                  reception of the minister was unaffectedly cordial, and it warmed his heart, and
                  reminded him of his own mother and sisters.
               "We did not know that the Conference had closed," said the farmer's wife. "I trust
                  you have had a pleasant session, and a pleasant journey."
               "Quite so," responded Mr. Arthur with animation; "we are usually glad to leave as
                  soon as we can. We are in haste to return to our families, and wish to know
                  something of our future fields of labor. You know we are not unlike shepherds
                  without a flock in conference week," he added smiling.
               "You will find your new flock scattered over hills and valleys," replied Mrs.
                  Hatfield. "We are a plain people, mostly farmers, and know but little of the
                  ceremonies of fashionable life. My husband says the golden rule is the best rule
                  of etiquette in the world; but I fear we do not practice the spirit of that as we
                  should," she added pleasantly.

                           Kind words! O earth like heaven would be,
                           And sweet would be our fellowship,
                           If kind thoughts dwelt in every heart,
                           And kind words hallow'd every lip!
                           Speak kindly, then, and every word
                           Of thine, within some heart shall be
                           A link in love's mysterious chains
                           To bind it ever unto thee.
                        
                     
                     —WILLIAM BAXTER.
                  
               
               A CASUAL observer might have thought the farmer and his wife were very plain,
                  old-fashioned people, and nothing more; but Mr. Arthur thought differently. The
                  minister had a quick eye for an excellence as well as a defect, and was an acute
                  observer of human nature, He thought he had discovered a vein of the purest ore,
                  and he thought rightly.
               Mrs. Hatfield was a meek, quiet-spirited woman, self-reliant, yet relying on and
                  confiding in her husband with a devotion that seemed a part of her religion. She
                  was of a yielding, condescending disposition; but independent and firm in
                  principle. Being ever ready to prefer another to herself, her magnanimity won the
                  esteem of the most forward and officious. Her object was not applause, but to do
                  good, and this she accomplished in many ways; how many, is known only to Him who
                  comprehends everything at a glance,
               If the society were in a commotion, she knew almost intuitively from whence
                  proceeded the little spark that kindled the flame. Her sensitive and
                  finely-cultivated spirit instinctively perceived the pervading religious or social
                  influence, as a barometer indicates the weight or pressure of the atmosphere, and
                  a few conciliatory and judicious words or explanations restored harmony when other
                  means had failed. The dispensing of charities, she rightly considered, should be
                  the profession of a Christian woman, though she rejected all flattering titles,
                  choosing rather to receive her reward in the approbation of her Divine Master,
                  "Forasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these my servants, ye did it unto
                  me."
               With the generous, cheerful farmer, the presiding genius of that home among the
                  hills, his house and his heart always open, one could not long be a stranger, and
                  the clergyman already felt, this man is my brother. And it
                   was an honor to any heart to feel a drawing toward such a man.
               "We are few in number," said Mr. Hatfield readily improving the opportunity
                  presented to give the minister the information he would desire, without subjecting
                  him to the awkward position of interrogator we are few in number, and all have an
                  opportunity to do something, which we are beginning to esteem a privilege. In our
                  finances, we are now always, in advance. Our class collections and subscriptions
                  for last quarter are in the treasury now. And at our last quarterly conference we
                  resolved to pay our minister's estimate at the beginning of the quarter instead of
                  its close. This makes it convenient for him and as well, yes, better for us. After
                  we have paid for a thing we are more interested in it ourselves."
               The minister breathed easier than he had for a year. A weight had been taken off
                  his spirits that oppressed him. He should not now be compelled, on his return to
                  his former station, to borrow money to pay his expenses for moving, as he had
                  expected. He had barely enough in his pocket to pay his return fare. But now his
                  heart was light, lighter even than his pockets. This ludicrous mental comparison
                  caused a smile; indeed, the minister felt disposed to smile at almost
                  anything.
               This honest, thoughtful, earnest, society—honest, for they desired the labors of
                  no man without paying him for them; thoughtful, for they strove to anticipate the
                  wants of their minister; earnest, for they acted as well as thought—had relieved
                  him from all embarrassment.
               "I need not assure you, Brother Hatfield, that I think your plan an excellent one;
                  every itinerant will agree with me in that opinion. It recommends itself to our
                  judgments as well as to our pockets," said Mr. Arthur, smiling, "Such a course
                  must prove a blessing to any society, and I doubt not you realize its happy
                  influences."
               
               "We certainly do," replied Mr. Hatfield."
               At that moment supper was announced, and the farmer arose and led the way into the
                  long kitchen. The daughters, Maria and Mary, had withdrawn from the room as soon
                  as the salutations were over. It was resolved and carried without a dissenting
                  voice by the girls, that the minister was good-natured and handsome, (two
                  important points;) that he had probably had no dinner, as he had made so quick a
                  journey, and must therefore be hungry. These resolutions no doubt quickened their
                  movements, for before their mother knew that the tea-kettle had boiled, coffee,
                  tea, smoking muffins, browned to precisely the right shade, a steak swimming in
                  butter, eggs boiled both hard and soft, a huge plate of doughnuts, suggested by
                  little Emmie Hatfield, mince and apple pies, and custards, with all the
                  concomitants of a tea-table, spread out on the board in true farmer-like
                  hospitality, presented a temptation not quite safe for a dyspeptic. However, none
                  of that unfortunate class appeared at the farmer's table that night, and the
                  minister felt inclined to follow the injunction of the apostle: "Whatsoever is set
                  before you, eat, asking no questions."
               Dwight and his little sister Emmie had slipped away while the family were at
                  supper, and were cracking nuts. To atone for the disappointment in not having some
                  of his "grand turnovers" placed in the table for "his minister," Dwight had the
                  promise of providing the nuts and apples for the evening.
               "I hope Brother Arthur has got lots of boys," said Dwight; "and then we can make
                  kites, and willow whistles, and water-wheels, and all that."
               "I hope he has some little girls too," said Emmie, throwing back her sunny curls,
                  that had fallen over her eyes for the twentieth time; "and then they can go with
                  me and find violets, and lady-slippers, and see my dear little chickie
                  birdies."
               "Well," replied Dwight, who was his mother's boy, "I hope so too, and I shall not
                  care if they are all girls; for it is just as good fun to do all the work myself,
                  and hear the girls wonder how I can make such things."
               Dwight, artless little fellow, expressed what grown-up boys sometimes think, and
                  he threw back his head; his little jacket became all at once too small for him,
                  and his boots pinched his feet. Dwight had grown some on that thought.
               
               "There, don't you think those nuts well cracked?" said the little boy to Billy,
                  who had just come in with two pails "brimming" full of milk.
               "Yes, that's well done," said Billy, in an encouraging, brotherly way; "but you
                  haven't got half enough yet. I'll show you how to rattle them out." 
               "That's it! that's it!" exclaimed Dwight; "just let you look at the fellows, and
                  their shells fly open."
               "Don't they! just look now, and see them shuffle their shells off for my especial
                  benefit," said Billy. "I have a natural affinity for nuts and apples, and such
                  like things, you know; and I suppose they have for me."
               "And doughnuts too, Billy," chimed in Emmie.
               "Yes, Emmie, and doughnuts too. I couldn't get along without them," added Billy,
                  in the best possible humor.
               "Ho-ho-ho! how you do make them fly,"` said Dwight; "you have got almost as many
                  as me now."
               "Now, you see, I'll just whistle out the rest of them," said Billy, as he
                  commenced a quick tune in a low whistle; and attempted to beat time with his
                  hammer and the heels of his boots. "That's quite too particular meter for my
                  musical powers: 
                     
                        "Rub a dub dub,
                        Rub a dub dow;
                        Robins are coming,
                        Yellow birds too,
                     
                   struck up Billy, bowing low to Emmie at the end of each line; and now the
                  nuts flew faster than ever.
               "O how funny you are, Billy!" said Emmie. "Do that again,"
               This Billy was very ready to do; for it was his delight to amuse the children, and
                  there was no end to his resources in this part of his calling.
               "There—there is enough!" said Billy, as he threw down the hammer; "now we will see
                  who'll take forks; and anybody who is too lazy to pick out their nuts after they
                  are cracked, ought to have grinders to munch them, shells and all."
               "Why, who is so lazy as that, Billy?" said Mary, who was just passing through the
                  room.
               "O, I know!" replied the lively boy, as he and Dwight ran down the cellar stairs to get some apples from the high bin. "I
                  know, Mary; and you may guess once, you may guess twice, you may guess a hundred
                  times, and you can't guess right."
               Mary could not have "guessed right;" and Billy's good taste and good sense would
                  not allow of his telling her that it was a minister of whom he was speaking. The
                  trifling circumstance had happened some years before, but Billy had not forgotten
                  it; for he thought it "hardly fair" for the minister, or anybody else, to "pick
                  out the whole pieces and throw the fragments away;" and he thought "it looked lazy
                  too." Was not Billy right? That minister knew but little of human nature, lacked
                  energy, and was only partially successful. A few years closed his active ministry,
                  and he was soon lost sight of.
               William Lawrence, or, as he was generally called at the farm-house, Billy, was an
                  orphan, now about fourteen years of age. He had lived at Farmer Hatfield's ever
                  since he could remember. He was a bright, active boy, full of fun and frolic. Work
                  was to him just as easy as play; for he seemed to delight in constant activity. He
                  would turn hay, or rake, or hoe, all day long, and be as ready to leap fences,
                  turn summersets, or run races with the old dog, Rover, as he was in the morning.
                  He had a clear head, too, and nothing seemed to escape his observation.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           So is it with true Christian hearts;
                           Their mutual share in Jesus' blood
                           An everlasting bond imparts,
                           Of holiest brotherhood,
                           O! might we all our lineage prove,
                           Give and forgive, do good and love,
                           By soft endearments in kind strife.
                           Light'ning the load of dayly life.
                        
                     
                     —KEBLE.
                  
               
               BEFORE the family had finished their repast, Billy, always active, had kindled a
                  fire in the parlor, and the room was soon well-nigh filled; the members of the
                  Church had dropped in to see and welcome their new minister.
               As Mr. Arthur and Mr. Hatfield entered, the people arose and greeted him cordially
                  and heartily. The clergyman appreciated this attention; it touched his heart.
               "Ha, Brother Daniel Boynton, you are come!" said Mr. Hatfield, as the former
                  entered. "How knew you that the minister had arrived?"
               "By the same means you knew he would be at the depot, Brother Jonas Hatfield! know
                  you now?" replied Mr. Boynton, with a good-natured, generous laugh. "And if my
                  nags had not been gone to-day, you would have lost your guest tonight, that's
                  certain."
               "That would have depended on your superior tactics then," replied Mr. Hatfield,
                  facetiously.
               "Or superior strength," rejoined Mr. Boynton, with characteristic humor and
                  energy.
               If such a wish would be proper," said Mrs. Arthur, "I should desire to be in more
                  places than one to-night, if I could be sure of meeting such pleasant
                  company."
               Old Mr. Harvey, whom all present treated as a father, and who was always ready
                  with a passage of Scripture for every occasion, improved the first pause in the
                  conversation to say, with perfect good-humor: "If I were not already enjoying
                  myself so well with my minister and the brethren here, I should ask, 'Why, have
                  our brethren the men of Judah stolen the king away, and why did ye despise us that
                  our advice should not be had in bringing the king home?'"
               "Father Harvey having ten parts or more in the king, is entitled to his remark,"
                  replied Dr. Richmond, the younger class-leader.
               This reply was well understood by the company pany to refer to Father Harvey's large family, all
                  of whom were members of the Church.
               This early opportunity of meeting so many of the members of his Church. Mr. Arthur
                  prized highly. He could now form a better idea of what they would need in the way
                  of instruction, and his plans to promote their improvement would be much more
                  likely to be successful. The people, too, felt an interest in their minister now
                  which they would not otherwise have done.
               They soon seemed to be very well acquainted with each other, and the minister
                  thought be knew more of this people than he had known of some of his former
                  societies at the end of several months. And he reflected how much better such a
                  course was, than for his Church to keep themselves far from him, and wait to see
                  whom the minister would call upon first, as some societies were in the habit of
                  doing, to their own disadvantage. These thoughts flew through Mr. Arthur's mind
                  during the evening, but he had not much time to reflect.
               "Tell me, if you please," said Mr. Arthur, "what is the secret of your financial
                  prosperity?"
               Father Harvey was the first to speak this time, although he was ordinarily rather
                  slow in showing his opinion, But this was subject in which he was so deeply
                  interested that his enthusiasm warmed at once.
               "Why you see," said the old gentleman as he half closed his small, gray, twinkling
                  eyes, while a benevolent smile lighted up his whole face, you see we have the
                  Bible, and it speaks to us very plainly on the duty of supporting the ministry. It
                  teaches us that 'The laborer is worthy of his hire,' and that 'They that preach
                  the Gospel should live of the Gospel.' 'Who,' it asks us, appealing to our common
                  sense, 'Who goeth a warfare at any time at his own charges? Who planteth a
                  vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit of the vineyard? or who feedeth a flock, and
                  drinketh not of the milk of the flock?' And you know the Bible teaches us, too,
                  that we are none the poorer even in the things, of this life for attending to this
                  duty. We have done nothing more than we ought to do. I fear we have often fallen
                  short of even reasonable service. Yet the Lord has acknowledged our poor
                  offerings, and blessed us in our basket and in our store," added the old gentleman
                  as he brushed away a tear. "So far as we have tried it," continued he, "we have
                  proved the Bible doctrine true, that 'There is that scattereth, and yet
                  increaseth.' We tried to our full satisfaction faction 'withholding more than is meet' long
                  ago."
               Father Harvey left off speaking, though he had not fully answered Mr. Arthur's
                  inquiry. He was too modest to acknowledge even to himself how it had come to pass
                  that the Church at the hamlet was so honorably distinguished for liberality, as
                  well as for peace and prosperity, above other Churches having the same Bible.
               Both hands of the good old man were on the top of his staff, and his head inclined
                  forward. His gray locks were flowing, and his face was open and expressive,
                  beaming with good-humor and benevolence,
               "The Bible," responded Mr. Arthur, "is truly the proper source of appeal on every
                  subject of duty; and I need not assure you, brethren, that it is a special
                  gratification to me that you have tested the practical excellence of its
                  instructions on the duty of contributing to the support of religion, and are so
                  ready to ascribe the glory of your prosperity to its Divine Author. In so doing,
                  you not only save your minister from pecuniary embarrassment, but at the same time
                  you enable him to labor for the promotion of the kingdom of Christ among you, in
                  fall confidence that he has your hearty cooperation, and that the blessing of
                  Heaven will attend his efforts. Besides, in declaring to you the whole counsel of
                  God, he will not fear that his motives are suspected, nor be liable to suspect
                  them himself."
               "Covetousness," remarked Dr. Richmond "is a sin to which the human heart is
                  peculiarly prone. Perhaps on no subject do we need line upon line, and precept
                  upon precept, more than upon this; and yet I can easily see how a minister of
                  sensibility would shrink from this part of his duty,"
               I think if the leaders and stewards, and other more influential members of the
                  Church, were right on this subject, the membership generally would soon see their
                  duty, and those who are Christians at heart would act up to their convictions,"
                  said Mr. Hatfield.
               "So far as my experience goes," observed Dr. Richmond, "I have found that the
                  younger members of my classes almost invariably adopt the practice of the older
                  members, in this particular especially."
               "That is true," responded Mr. Marston, the other class-leader; "and more than
                  that, those young converts who neglect their class money, or apportionment, soon
                  lose their first love; and therefore I
                  exhort them to giving, as a duty of their religion, and one they cannot neglect
                  and grow in grace."
               "That is right," replied Mr. Boynton; "however niggardly we might be, we should
                  not be likely to think you had a selfish eye on the contribution box."
               "Just so," added Father Harvey; "we ought to stir up each other on the, duty of
                  supporting our minister, rather than subject him to the disagreeable task of doing
                  this. Even the great apostle, although he urged the duty with all plainness,
                  feared himself to partake of the benefit lest he should hinder the Gospel of
                  Christ. And this has been the practice of our ministry. They have generally shrunk
                  from pleading for themselves, lest they should hinder the progress of the Gospel.
                  'We seek not yours, but you,' has been their motto."
               "I believe the Methodist people have as much of the spirit of liberality as any
                  other," said Mr. Arthur. "The deficiency in ministerial support among us does not
                  proceed from any particular defect in our system; it has grown out of its
                  excellences. However, there is now no longer any necessity for it."
               Father Harvey now arose to depart. Prayer was proposed, and all bowed before a
                  throne of grace, to which they had access through the mediation of the Redeemer;
                  and the minister and people separated in love and confidence.
               Though Mr. Arthur had received no direct answer to his inquiry, he had not felt
                  disposed to repeat it. As he had listened to the words of Father Harvey, and the
                  noble responses of his younger brethren, and beheld the glory with which the
                  Spirit of Christ had already crowned the venerable Christian, he was satisfied
                  where lay in part, at least, the secret for which he had inquired.
               The truth is, not only Father Harvey had the Bible, but the Bible had Father
                  Harvey too. For the last twenty years he had read it through regularly once a
                  year, and a retentive memory enabled him to repeat whole chapters correctly, and
                  he believed in his heart every word of it. It had long been known at the hamlet
                  that he honored the Lord with the first-fruits of all his increase, invariably
                  laying by for religious purposes the first tenth of all that the Lord gave him,
                  before applying any part to his own use and that this was by no means the measure
                  of his liberality, but only that proportion which he regarded as the Lord's, under all circumstances, by
                  unchangeable law, just as the first of every seven days is the Lord's. It was
                  understood, moreover, that other prominent members acted on the same plan, and it
                  was generally supposed chat the example was followed by several enterprising young
                  men who were signally prospered in both temporal and spiritual things. Indeed, the
                  effect was visible upon all.*
                  
               
               
                  *This is not a fancy sketch; it is substantially a narration of facts.
               
               Plans for collecting funds for the dissemination of the Gospel have been numerous
                  enough, and perhaps good enough; but not until the Church comes back to the
                  Scriptural plan of providing the funds—laying by for the Lord—can entire success
                  be expected in collecting. Let each individual member of Christ's Church
                  religiously lay aside a tenth at least—the first tenth—of all his income for the
                  support of the Gospel, and there will be found no difficulty in collecting, for
                  the Lord will have a little treasury in the dwelling-place of every Christian,
                  which he will seldom suffer to be empty.
               Mr. Arthur was much pleased with his new society. Never before had he met with a
                  reception so open-handed and cordial. Their frankness and honest simplicity
                  charmed him, and their just views of things and willingness to act according to
                  their convictions of right, showed the power of grace upon their hearts.
               On the other hand, the deep piety of the minister, his urbanity, his intuitive
                  perception of the proprieties of life, and his charming address, won the hearts of
                  his new acquaintances, and prepared them to appreciate better his talents and
                  labors. He indulged in no habit that would lower him in the estimation of any of
                  his people. He recollected that suggestive saying, that a glimmering taper from an
                  alabaster lamp would send forth more light than a blazing one from a tin lantern,
                  and therefore avoided all coarseness or rudeness in word or action. He was of the
                  opinion that the want of success of superior talent might not unfrequently be
                  attributable to this cause.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Look how they laugh, and stretch out their arms,
                           And open wide their blue eyes
                           To hail their father; while their little forms
                           Flutter as wing'd with joy.
                        
                     
                     —BYRON.
                  
               
               THE next morning the sun arose bright and clear, though the farmer's active family
                  had not awaited his approach to arouse them from refreshing slumbers. Willing
                  hands and cheerful hearts were busy in making preparation for the ministers early
                  departure for his family. He would reach them before night, and arrangements were
                  now made for them to come on to their new home the next Saturday.
               The farmer's wife and daughters, thinking how little they could do in the service
                  of their Divine Master had resolved to perform the duties nearest them instead of
                  sighting for opportunities, to do good beyond their reach. If "a cup of cold
                  water" given "in the name of a disciple," should not lose its reward, they could
                  indeed do something that would not be forgotten by Him who reckons every act of
                  kindness done to one of the least of his servants, as done to himself.
               A pleasant attention, a word of consolation when the heart is sad, or, a simile of
                  encouragement when it is depressed, like a refreshing cordial, cheers and revives
                  the wayworn and weary pilgrim.
               Mr. Arthur bade adieu to his kind friends with a cheerful and a thankful heart,
                  encouraged for the great work before him, and eager to enter upon it. His thoughts
                  rushed on to his family, and long before he reached home, his plans for their
                  removal were all laid.
               All day at the minister's house a little brood were fluttering with delight. Now
                  they were nestling around their mother, asking the same questions and receiving
                  the same answers over and over again; then away like the wind, the older ones
                  flying through the front gate and up, to the corner of, the street, and Jennie and
                  Frankie, running after, and Charlie as far as the front door, and all were
                  constantly on the lookout for "papa."
               At last, wearied with waiting so long, they have become more quiet, and each one
                  has turned to seek for some new source of 48 ment. But there is one there, the heart, of that
                  household, that never tires in watching.
               Now her quick step, and "Here comes papa," bring the lively group after her as by
                  magic. That same bright pale face and beaming blue eye, peering through the
                  curtains, has quickened the heart and the steps of the minister, and in a moment
                  he is in the bosom of his family.
               
                  
               
               A quiet evening together would have been grateful to Mr. Arthur and his devoted
                  wife; but busy, hurried preparations for their departure must be entered upon
                  immediately. The minister knew not, when he left home for Conference, that he
                  would be removed from this station; consequently no arrangements had been made for
                  it. But when he arrived at the Conference he found another arrangement was
                  necessary. They would have been glad to postpone the removal until the next week,
                  in order to secure more time and lessen the labor. This seemed very desirable in
                  Mrs. Arthur's present delicate health. But their new society wished the minister
                  to be with them, as their pulpit could not be supplied, and many would come from a
                  distance to hear him.
               "To make sacrifices for the people we minister to, is a part of our creed," said
                  Mr. Arthur; "and the people should not forget that to sacrifice for their minister
                  would look very well inserted in theirs. I made no objection to the arrangement; I
                  presume they would have acquiesced if I had."
               "We will do all we can for them," responded the noble-hearted wife. "They have
                  been so thoughtful, and have performed their part so nobly, that I love them
                  already. O, it seems that the whole burden of removing has been taken away; such a
                  load has been taken from my spirits, a load much heavier to bear than the toils of
                  the itinerancy. You will not have to go out 'money hunting' now, and you have been
                  so cordially received too. I shall know what that means whenever I think of the
                     coldness ness of Brother Wardlaw. I
                  can with a cheerful heart make sacrifices for such a people." And Mrs. Arthur
                  brushed away a tear.
               Late that night the minister and his wife prepared for rest with grateful hearts,
                  firmly relying on an overruling Providence, and thankful to meet again in health
                  and peace.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Then kneeling down, to heaven's eternal King,
                           The saint, the father, and the husband prays;
                           Hope "springs exulting on triumphant wing,"
                           That thus they all shall meet in future days;
                           There ever bask in uncreated rays,
                           No more to sigh, or shed the bitter tear;
                           Together hymning their Creator's praise,
                           In such society, yet still more dear,
                           When circling time moves round in an eternal sphere.
                        
                     
                     BURNS.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           The soul reposing on assured relief,
                           Feels herself happy amid all her grief;
                           Forgets her labor as she toils along,
                           Weeps tears of joy, and bursts into a song.
                        
                     
                     —COWPER.
                  
               
               THE next day, and the day following, here and there, here and there, back and
                  forth, up and down, in a state of perpetual motion, seemed each member of the
                  household. The children, who thought much depended on their exertions, were as
                  busy as bees; some in acts really useful, while other little hands, though
                  innocent of mischief, were expert in misplacing everything within their reach.
               "Can I carry my little wooden wagon with me, father, that you made for me? I think
                  that is too good a wagon to leave," said Frankie, a bright boy of seven years.
               "No my son; we can hardly make room for it," replied the father,
               "Are we going to take Sister Greene, and Sister Abbie, and dear Sister Irene with
                     us, mamma?" chimed in Jennie, whose
                  ideas of moving had just begun to wake up.
               "No, darling; we must leave all these kind friends here," said her mother; and
                  Mrs. Arthur smiled sadly. This, to her sensitive heart, was the great grief of
                  moving.
               The sweet child turned away, looking sorrowful as she murmured, "I wish we could
                  take them."
               
                  
               
               "What shall I do with my wagon?" asked Frankie; for until that was disposed of he
                  could think of nothing else.
               "If you wish to make the most of it, I think it would be well to give it to Moses
                  Strong," said his mother.
               "Why, mother, that is the very boy who told me the other day that he would set his
                  big dog on me," said Frank; and he looked up in his mother's face wonderingly.
               "And that is the very reason why I propose to you to give it to him," said his
                  mother.
               "But why should I not give it to some little boy who has always treated me
                  kindly?" asked Frank.
               "You might do so, my son, but perhaps that would not be making the most of it,"
                  replied his mother.
               "What do you mean by making the most of it, mother?" asked Frank.
               "In giving it to Moses you might make one who had tried to injure you your friend,
                  and teach your own heart a lesson of forgiveness."
               Frank thought a moment, and then clapping his hands together, while a beam of
                  satisfaction lighted up his whole face, he exclaimed, "I'll do it, mother; for
                  then I shall feel like forgiving Moses." And then his little heart was at
                  peace.
               Frank had indeed made the most of his treasure. He had learned a lesson worth much
                  more to him than his wagon, as highly as he had prized it, and as loth as he had
                  been to part with it for to leave it had
                  been a real sacrifice to the little boy. He had found out that the way to overcome
                  unkind feeling toward an enemy is to do him a kindness.
               "Really," said Mrs. Arthur, quite perplexed, "I am as much at a loss what to do as
                  Frank. Here are my brooms, not quite so good as new to be sure—now don't laugh,
                  Brother Arthur," continued she, smiling herself—"my washtubs, baskets, barrels,
                  several valuable articles of ware, besides various other things that we shall need
                  as soon as we get to our now appointment and at every removal we have been obliged
                  to leave such things behind, or pay nearly as much as they are worth for
                  transportation."
               "I know it, my dear, but it cannot be helped," replied the master.
               "I know we cannot help it; but our people could in most cases. These things will
                  do our successor no good, for he is a single man; and something has always
                  prevented us from leaving them for our successor. These are some of the many
                  leakages that drain a minister's purse. Besides, be as careful as we may, several
                  of our things will be broken and injured in moving, and they must be replaced. My
                  carpets I have had to cut over to fit new rooms, every time we have moved, until
                  they look like patchwork. Why I don't think twenty-five dollars will make up the
                  little losses we sustain in such matters every time we move."
               "No, probably not; and that is one tenth of what we received the first year of my
                  ministry," added the minister, smiling.
               "We have already moved seven times. Our losses in this respect have then amounted
                  to one hundred and seventy-five dollars."
               "And then if you reckon the expense of moving those things that should be
                  furnished, you add quite an item to the loss," said Mr. Arthur.
               "The necessary expenses ought not to be taken into the account when we consider
                  the blessed results of the itinerancy," said the minister's wife. "But the amount
                  paid for moving parsonage furniture would in at short time pay for it, and we
                  should be saved the wear and tear these things inflict upon us."
               "My bill for moving my books alone averages at least five dollars every time we
                  move, besides the trouble and time of packing and unpacking; and if I should move
                  twenty times, which is not improbable, the amount would be, sufficient to furnish a pretty good parsonage
                  library," said Mr. Arthur.
               "How these things do count up," replied Mrs. Arthur.
               "They do indeed," responded the minister; "but all these things will have a remedy
                  in time," he added, more cheerfully. "Our people are beginning to wake, up, so let
                  us not despair. By the time you and I are superannuated, Mary, these defects will
                  all be removed."
               "I hope they will," replied his wife; "but that helps us, and the hundreds of
                  itinerants now in the field, but little. In some places these things are
                  considered, and mostly prevented, I know. I wish it were more general, and that
                  something might be done at once."
               "So do I Mary; and if the Methodist world could hear your plea, something would be
                  done," he added, playfully.
               The minister, without doubt, was right. That pale face, that serene brow, that
                  uncomplaining, undaunted spirit, would have aroused the spirit of self-sacrifice
                  in all; and something would be done to remove these and all other unnecessary
                  burdens of the itinerancy.
               Several of their friends dropped in one after another, during the day, with offers
                  of assistance and regrets for their departure. The hearts of the pastor's family
                  and of his flock became more closely cemented in the bonds of fellowship and
                  Christian love, now they were about to separate.
               "They are really a kind-hearted, well-meaning people," said Mrs. Arthur to her
                  husband; "and I find it hard to leave them." And she seemed to forget all her own
                  toils, and the scanty allowance that had been afforded them, and the petty
                  annoyances she had been occasionally subjected to. All their little acts of
                  kindness and attention were cherished in her memory, and left only sunshine
                  there.
               The next morning they were up with the dawn of day and an hour afterward were all
                  on their way to the dépôt
               "There is Sister Blanchard calling after us," sung out Nathaniel, the eldest son,
                  who was on the look-out for acquaintances.
               The driver stopped, and the lady came up, "merely to say good-by once more," she
                  said; "and here is a little basket for the children, and the cakes are from
                  grandma."
               They all sung out many times, "Good-by!" and Sister Celia was soon left out of
                  sight.
               
               A tear bedewed Mrs. Arthur's cheek; but the children were delighted.
               The basket had already been explored, and they had found in it a fine orange and
                  an apple for each; and "just five of Grandma Barnard's nice cup-cakes," with one
                  of her favorite little monthly roses stuck in the top of each.
               "That is just like Grandma Barnard, isn't it?" said Marion, the eldest of the
                  group.
               "Yes; that's Grandma Barnard, and nobody else," replied Nattie.
               At the dépôt, they found several of their friends assembled, who crowded around
                  them as if to prolong their stay. Some were there who had been led "to the Lamb of
                  God who taketh away the sins of the world," under the ministrations of Mr. Arthur;
                  and their tears fell thick and fast, and they were overcome with deep emotion.
               Finally, the last words of admonition and encouragement fell from the faithful
                  minister's lips, the last farewell was spoken, and the pastor and his flock part
                  to meet no more until they shall assemble in the great day of final accounts.

                           If one heart grows lighter,

                           If one drooping spirit,
                           Weary, faint, and sad,
                           Half forgets its anguish
                           For a little while,
                           Is it vain for us to speak?
                           Vain for us to smile?
                        
                     
                     —A. WESTON.
                  
               
               THE sun had sunk far westward before Mr. Arthur and his family arrived at the end
                  of their journey. Frankie and Charley were both fast asleep, and the older
                  children, quite too large for that, of course were glad to escape from a further
                  test of their courage, which had visibly begun to decline.
               "Here we are, my dear," said Mr. Arthur, as he cast a glance from the window; "and
                  there are some of our people," he added with evident satisfaction.
               Mr. Hatfield and his active neighbor and Christian brother, Boynton, were both in
                  waiting, and desirous of taking the minister and his
                   family to their own homes; and two or three of the Harvey fraternity
                  were, ready with their teams to take the movables to the parsonage.
               "Can we not go directly to the parsonage. ourselves?" said Mrs. Arthur. "Our
                  children are all very weary; it is Saturday night, and I think I can manage them
                  with less trouble there than at any other place."
               "If you prefer to do so," said Mr. Hatfield. "The house is well warmed, and
                  several of the sisters are there now."
               "O, then, all is right; we will go directly there," replied the minister's
                  wife.
               At the parsonage they were welcomed by Mrs. Hatfield, Mrs. Marston, the wife of
                  one of the class-leaders, Mrs. Boynton, and Julia and Lana, the youngest daughters
                  of Father Harvey.
               These ladies, with several others, had spent "a few hours" that day "in putting
                  things to rights a little." Some of them were at the same place the day previous.
                  What they had been about was not told, though housekeepers could easily "guess,"
                  and it was known that they had requested "Good Sister Capron," their former
                  pastor's wife, as they had each of her predecessors, "not to make the least
                  preparation for the new minister's family," adding, that "it would be impossible
                  for her to do so without great inconvenience, and they would make it all
                  right."
               These modest women having no desire to set forth claims to amazing smartness,
                  never made mention of what they had done; and if the parsonage was left
                  "uncommonly tidy," and the furniture "soiled the least possible," nothing was said
                  about it. They thought such a remark would seem to imply a lack in some former
                  occupant.
               The kind hearts of these Christian women
                  glowed with generous sympathy when they saw Mrs. Arthur, the personification of
                  purity and undaunted Christian heroism, almost self-immolated, and they resolved
                  to cherish carefully that fading drooping flower, and, if possible, restore it to
                  health and vigor.
               "Would you not like to rest a little while?" said Mrs. Boynton, a plump little
                  body with a sweet, smiling face, and a way as winning as a child's. We will have
                  tea ready pretty soon, and then we will call you. Here is a little bedroom just
                  out of the study, and all warm," continued she, in tones so soothing and mild,
                  that Mrs. Arthur felt her heart swelling, and her eyes moistening. "I will assist
                  you, do let me," she continued, as she arranged the pillows, and before the
                  minister's wife was aware that she had given assent she was sinking to repose.
               The children were so well entertained by the girls, that none of them cried
                  "because it did not seem like home," as they had done when taken into a cold,
                  unfurnished and unlighted house hungry and sleepy.
               "This seems almost like home, now, Frankie," said Jennie, as she went skipping
                  across the room; "I shall love to live here, I know."
               "So shall I," replied Frank; "and don't you see, they are getting supper for
                  us!"
               As there were no empty shelves in the pantry, since a half dozen well-filled
                  baskets had arrived from as many different families, It was not found difficult to
                  spread an excellent table.
               After tea, a few large boxes were unscrewed, Mr. Arthur's books removed to the
                  book-case, and one or two beds made up in as quiet a manner as possible, after
                  which the company left the minister's family alone in their new home.
               "This is delightful," said Mrs. Arthur; "it seems like going home. In what a quiet
                  way, really home-like, everything has been conducted."
               "Yes, this is just the thing," replied Mr. Arthur. "There is some difference
                  between such a reception, and coming worn and weary after the fatigues of a
                  laborious Conference, packing, and a long journey, and finding a cold,
                  unfurnished, and unlighted house, with not a friend to greet us. I assure you,
                  Mary, I feel like preaching to-morrow."
               "Your looks indicate it," said Mrs. Arthur, smiling. "I have not seen you so much
                  like yourself for a long time."
               "How could it be otherwise," replied Mr.
                  Arthur, "when my wife has grown ten years younger in the last five hours?"
               "Well, my, dear," said the minister's wife, brightening up still more, "I did
                  think myself very much fatigued, just before we arrived, but somehow that sense of
                  weariness has strangely departed from me. What a delightful company we found here,
                  and just the right number to render valuable assistance."
               "The larger part of the company retired before we came; so Brother Boynton
                  informed me," said Mr. Arthur.
               "How thoughtful," replied the minister's wife; "I should have been glad to have
                  seen them all if I had felt equal to it."
               "Such thoughtfulness is a rare virtue," replied the minister; "I was glad on your
                  account. I begin to think there are a few leading spirits here who have a right
                  view of things themselves, and a rare faculty of leading others into their
                  measures. Where such is the case, we may expect to find a pleasant state of
                  things."
               It was not until Monday that the minister and his wife knew the extent of the
                  attentions of their new society. Pantry, cellar, and wood-house had received
                  contributions.
               Marian and Nathaniel were early exploring the premises, and were constantly
                  singing out, "Look here mother; just look here!" Now it was a "ham," or a
                  "cheese"—they had never seen a whole cheese before; now "apples, and eggs, and
                  potatoes;" and now, "O good! good! a pile of nuts, a real pile, mother!" True
                  enough. And Billy and Dwight, Mr. Arthur's young friends at Farmer Hatfield's,
                  were no doubt answerable for placing them there in a sly corner on purpose to
                  surprise the minister's children.
               But they did not espy all. The friends seemed to have forgotten nothing and their
                  thoughtful attentions, performed with very little inconvenience to themselves, had
                  been a real benefit to their minister's family, not only in a pecuniary manner,
                  but it helped to strengthen and sustain them, and to prepare them for continued
                  trust in God, and an immediate entrance upon the pastoral work.

                           Christian, trust thou in God, 
                           And life's dark hours illumed with light shall be;
                           The path the lowly Saviour meekly trod,
                           Is it too rugged or too lone for thee?
                           Shadows may throng thy way;
                           But banish from thy heart the phantom fear,
                           And the glad dawning of a brighter day,
                           A day of sunshine and sweet hope is near.
                        
                     
                     —A. WESTON.
                  
               
               MONDAY evening there was quite a little assembly at Dr. Richmond's office. Mr.
                  Boynton, both class-leaders, "Father" Harvey, and two of his sons, Mr. Hatfield,
                  and several others were present, and all were in a very animated conversation.
               "It will never do," said Mr. Boynton, with emphasis; "I could not sleep Saturday
                  night in thinking of it; there is no religion in such a course. I would as soon be
                  caught stealing a sheep as hearing preaching without paying for it, and my full
                  proportion too. I think it a great pity when a man becomes so rich that his
                  minister's tax is too heavy for him. There is old Mr. Crawford, his government tax
                  is so much now he has nothing to give for the sup. port of the Gospel. When he was
                  a poor man he could pay his taxes easy enough, and had a little to spare for
                  religious purposes; now his wealth is taxed it makes him groan."
               "If the minister labors for us and our families, we are in duty bound to support
                  him and his family. And it would be a shame to any people to ask how little the
                  preacher could live upon without real suffering," said Mr. Hatfield.
               "Here are ten of us," said Mr. Marston "substantial sort of people, we might say;
                  suppose we take the responsibility of the thing; it will be only ten dollars
                  apiece more than what we have been paying. The rest will easily be made up from
                  the classes."
               "I tell you such a trifle ought not to be taken into the account in such a case,"
                  replied Mr. Boynton with emphasis, and without waiting for a response. It was
                  evident he intended to produce conviction in the minds of all before allowing them
                  an opportunity to commit themselves.
               His open, earnest face, beaming with a glow of generous sympathy, his energetic
                     manner, expressive of deep feeling,
                  and his known integrity of purpose, never failed to make themselves felt; while
                  his eminently social nature bound all hearts to him. He exerted an influence
                  superior, perhaps, to any other man in the society.
               Mr. Hatfield had a quiet, persuasive power, "Father" Harvey was honored and
                  beloved, Dr. Richmond, exact in his Christian deportment, and eminent for
                  unswerving fidelity in all the duties of his station, was emphatically a sure man;
                  Mr. Marston always arrayed himself on the right side, and though his opinion might
                  be unexpressed, yet all knew where to find him; while, Mr. Boynton seemed to sway
                  all hearts with an irresistible power. He was a man of impulse; yet his seemed one
                  strong impulse toward good that never abated. Happy the minister who has such a
                  band of co-laborers.
               "Certainly such a trifle should not be taken into the account," continued Mr.
                  Hatfield; and for Mrs. Arthur to get along without a servant is out of the
                  question; and with their present salary they cannot afford it. They have been
                  attempting it the past year, and look at the effects of it. The minister's wife is
                  nearly a wreck, and the minister himself depressed with burdens which should be
                  borne by other shoulders."
               "Without doubt much of his time has been spent in attempting to lighten the cares
                  of his wife, which he has endeavored to make up by encroaching upon the hours of
                  rest," said Mr. Marston.
               "It is rather humiliating to think of the minister's time being spent in the
                  nursery," said Dr. Richmond, "as though it were worth no more than the wages of a
                  girl; and yet I have known 
                     minister's
                     ministers'
                   families, through the neglect of their people, in precisely this
                  situation."
               "So have I," replied Mr. Boynton; "and the people who have thus neglected their
                  duty to their minister, complaining that he did not visit them and bewailing the
                  want of an efficient ministry."
               "And it is more humiliating to add, but it is true for all that," said Mr.
                  Hatfield, "that these individuals are those who make so many unjust comparisons
                  between our ministry and that of other denominations, and who bow so obsequiously
                  to everything out of their own communion. Even the plated passes for the true coin with them, if it has any mark
                  but our own upon it."
               "Just so," replied Mr. Boynton; "but what could they expect of a minister in such
                  a case? He has not the heart of a barbarian, and cannot see his wife sinking under
                  so much labor and care, while he has a hand to help. And should he press the
                  matter upon his people, in many cases his usefulness for his whole term would be
                  destroyed."
               "Many of our societies are new; and so long as our Church retains her missionary
                  character, we shall have new societies constantly springing up. The people have
                  not yet learned what is right. The Gospel has not got a deep hold upon their
                  hearts yet. Many good men have erroneous ideas, which time, and patience, and a
                  good deal of grace alone will correct," replied "Father" Harvey.
               "I know it, and more is the pity," answered Mr. Boynton. "My wife was speaking of
                  that just now." We must excuse him for thinking his wife an oracle; many others
                  entertained the same opinion of the sweet-spirited, discreet woman.
               "My wife," continued he, "was speaking of this matter of help also; and she says
                  that, with the same number in the family, there is double the work to be done in a
                  minister's house. There is company coming at all times, to be entertained and fed,
                  besides constant interruptions from callers; the children requiring double the
                  attention at such times, as some of us well know, and everything to be kept in
                  company order."
               "Exactly so," replied Mr. Hatfield; "and then, if any man needs the society of his
                  wife, that man is the minister who feels the responsibilities of his position. He
                  above all needs the solace of domestic life, and sympathy and support in his
                  public work?"
               "But how can he have this," exclaimed the doctor when the wasted health of the
                  mother of his children claims his sympathy, and calls him from his work?"
               "We do not expect our minister's wife to do the work of a pastor," added, Mr.
                  Marston "we think the care of her husband and children her sphere of action. And,
                  as Brother Boynton remarks, that is full enough to employ the time of two women at
                  least."
               "As a general thing, all denominations expect vastly too much of their minister's
                  wife," observed Mr. Leonard, the dentist, who had recently removed to the hamlet. "She must abound in
                  hospitality to strangers, and to the poor, and in attendance upon the sick,
                  besides having the general watch-care of the sisterhood, the supervision of
                  charitable societies, and being a leader in prayer-meetings, and a tract
                  distributer."
               "Well, I should be very unwilling to give my wife to the parish in that way," said
                  Mr. Boynton. "I sadly fear my home would soon cease to be the paradise that it now
                  is; and my children could poorly spare the presence and training of their
                  mother."
               The company smiled at his earnestness; and the doctor, who was unmarried "cheered"
                  him.
               "My opinion is," said "Father" Harvey, "that the minister's wife should be her own
                  judge in such matters. Attentions upon the sick and poor are duties which belong
                  to every Christian as they have opportunity. Her duties in the praying circle must
                  be decided by herself. It is to be presumed, that if she follows the teachings of
                  the Spirit, she will be well instructed."
               The next Saturday evening, one of the stewards of the Church called at the
                  parsonage; and, on leaving, deposited a sealed envelope in the hands of the
                  minister.
               Mr. Arthur opened it, and read aloud:
               "You will find inclosed fifty dollars, the first quarter's payment of two hundred
                  dollars, which we have voted to add to your present salary.
               "The society think Mrs. Arthur needs a servant. If the addition of this sum to
                  your present salary will secure it to her, our wishes will be accomplished.
               "If anything further is necessary, you will do us a favor by making it known.
               "In behalf of the board."
               Mrs. Arthur could now scarcely refrain from weeping, and the eyes of the minister
                  were dimmed with tears. They had undaunted, suffered privations and afflictions,
                  their unyielding spirits had stood unmoved in dark and trying moments, but now
                  they were subdued under a sense of God's providing, watchful care.
               "Really! I have never needed this, so much as I now do," said Mrs. Arthur. "It is
                  providential."
               That night the minister and his wife sung, in subdued voices:
                  
                     
                        "How do thy mercies close me round!
                        Forever be thy name adored;
                        I blush in all things to abound;
                        The servant is above his Lord.
                     
                     
                        "Inured to poverty and pain,
                        A suffering life my Master led;
                        The Son of God, the Son of man,
                        He had not where to lay his head.
                     
                     
                        "But, lo a place he hath prepared

                        Yea! he himself becomes my guard;
                        He smooths my bed, and gives me sleep.
                     
                     
                        "Jesus protects; my fears be gone:

                           Its happiest soil in the serenest minds.

               THE kindness and attention to the wants of the minister on the part of the people,
                  were the fruitful source of many conversations between Mr. Arthur and his wife.
                  Everything had been done so promptly and cheerfully; his necessities had been
                  anticipated, and met with so much feeling and delicacy, that the effect upon them
                  both was most salutary.
               The minister performed his labor with an energy and a buoyancy of spirit, such as
                  he hardly knew he possessed. His religious enjoyments increased, and he realized
                  the presence and the sustaining and life-giving influence of the Eternal in a
                  degree he had not for a long time felt.
               The beloved partner of his joys and sorrows felt the influence of the change in
                  their condition tion even more than the
                  minister himself. Her cheek recovered its natural glow, her eye its brightness,
                  and her step its elasticity. This change more than repaid those benevolent hearts
                  who had been so assiduous to her.
               "I begin to think, Mary," said Mr. Arthur to his wife one day, "that my good
                  brethren here will have a large share in my glory. I have few crosses and trials
                  compared to what I sometimes have had. They seem resolved to bear these
                  themselves."
               "I have thought so myself," replied Mrs. Arthur. But our willingness to bear
                  whatever will promote the glory of God will secure to us heavenly favor, will it
                  not? He has never suffered us to be tempted above what we are able to bear, but
                  has, with every temptation made a way for our escape."
               "You think, and so do I, that many of our trials are the result of temptation,"
                  replied Mr. Arthur.
               "I have no doubt of it, my dear," said Mrs. Arthur. "Our wants have not been
                  starving, nor our annoyances persecutions. What necessities and privations have
                  not many endured for the sake of wealth and renown? For the love of art, the
                  artist has subjected himself to fastings ings, to destitution, and to exile. The
                  philosopher, for the love of his books, will live in a garret, and subsist on his
                  crust. The naturalist and the explorer will expose themselves to the inclemencies
                  of all climates; will live on the meager supplies of the knapsack, or the
                  uncertain supplies of the chase; and will sleep under the open sky, or in clefts
                  of rocks, in their favorite pursuits. And can we not welcome more than all this
                  for the love of Christ?"
               "You are a true heroine, Mary," said Mr. Arthur; "and we may well ask ourselves,
                  what are the privations, inconveniences, annoyances, and toils of the itinerancy,
                  when compared to the great recompense of the reward? And to the sufferings of our
                  adorable Redeemer they are not so much as the dust in the balance."
               "The fear or the effects of poverty should not certainly afflict the loyal
                  servants of Him, who, 'though he was rich, became poor, that we through his
                  poverty might be made rich,'" replied Mrs. Arthur.
               "These do not afflict me for myself, Mary," said Mr. Arthur. "I often realize that
                  in the strength of Christ I am strong for the conflict. If ever I am afflicted by them, it is when I think
                  of you and the children. But to minister to a people, Mary, who seem to have no
                  interest in the comfort or convenience of their minister, to strive to fulfill my
                  ministry, 'that I may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;' and where I had
                  looked for fruits, to find covetousness, and evil surmisings, and fault findings,
                  these are the real trials of the minister."
               "And yet you do not look for all the fruits of the Spirit to appear at once, and
                  are never discouraged," said Mrs. Arthur.
               "No; the husbandman spared the barren fig-tree, though he came three years seeking
                  fruit and found none."
               The minister and his wife were ready in excuses for delinquencies, and thereby
                  saved themselves many unpleasant reflections; and happy would it have been for
                  some of the people among whom he had labored, if they had cultivated more
                  carefully the same spirit of charity.
               "We are getting on finely," called out Mr. Hatfield to "Father" Harvey, as the
                  latter was riding by one morning.
               "Yes, yes, Brother Hatfield," replied the old gentleman, his countenance
                  brightening; "we have peace within our walls and prosperity within our
                  palaces."
               "There is a cordial, hearty interest between pastor and people that I like to
                  see," said Mr. Hatfield. "It argues well for the future."
               "You will always find it so; you will always find it so," replied "Father" Harvey,
                  with a pleasant animation. "The people can look the minister in the face, and feel
                  that they have endeavored to do their duty to him; and that they are not in debt
                  to him either."
               "Yes, yes," replied Mr. Hatfield; "if a man owes another, and has not the ability
                  or the disposition to pay him, he dislikes to meet that man. Let the debt be paid,
                  and he is cordial again."
               "Exactly so, brother," said "Father" Harvey; "and thus it is with the people
                  toward their minister. The injunction of the apostle might be profitably followed
                  in such cases: Owe no man anything, but to love one another."
               Mr. Hatfield smiled at the ardor of the old gentleman, though he manifested nearly
                  as much himself.
               "It is true, 'Father' Harvey," he replied; if the stewards and leaders are
                     negligent, and the minister is
                  oppressed in consequence, a coldness of feeling naturally springs up between them.
                  If the members neglect to pay their class money or apportionment, when the
                  preacher makes them a visit they apprehend that he is aware of the fact, feel
                  embarrassed, and restraint in his presence, and consequently do not enjoy his
                  pastoral call. They feel a sense of the injustice and of their own
                  dishonesty."
               "And they will feel it in another way too," replied "Father" Harvey, as he drew in
                  his reins and gathered up his whip. "The old prophet can tell them in what manner:
                  'Ye looked for much, and lo! it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did
                  blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of my house that is waste, and
                  ye run every man unto his own house. "Therefore the heavens over you are stayed
                  from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruits.' I believe in a particular
                  providence, Brother Hatfield." And with a benignant "Good-morning," the old
                  gentleman drove on.
               "It is even so," Mr. Hatfield soliloquized, as he brought to mind some of "Father"
                  Harvey's oft-quoted passages of Scripture: "There is that scattereth and yet
                  increaseth, and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to
                  poverty." "Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough;
                  ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm;
                  and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes." "Why?
                  saith the Lord of hosts. Because of my house that is waste, and ye run every man
                  unto his own house."

                     —MONTGOMERY.
                  
               
               SPRING had passed, and summer, with all its rich and gorgeous, beauty, was
                  reveling in the lap of easy luxuriance. Broad meadows of stately maize and waving
                  grain hummed anthems of praise in the passing breeze, and reverently bowed their
                  heads, as if to adore the Giver of the rain, and the dew, and the sunshine.
                  Orchards, scattered over the hillsides, were beginning to bend under their weight
                  of wealth.
               The hearts of the pious farmers expanded with gratitude to the Lord of all, in the
                  prospect of a bountiful harvest. The angel of peace and of plenty hovered
                  over the hamlet, and with protecting wings screened them from storms and from
                  blight.
               Mr. Arthur, also, was earnestly watching for the first-fruits of his labors among
                  this people. The farmers, since his coming among them, had sown and planted, and
                  already they beheld the fruits of their industry. And the minister asked himself whether it were too soon for him
                  to look for the results of his ministry.
               The faithful pastor was not destined to wait long. The good seed sown had already
                  begun to germinate. The orphan, William Lawrence, or, as he was affectionately
                  called by his friends at the hamlet, "Billy," the bright, active, energetic,
                  industrious, playful, mirth-loving Billy, had yielded his heart to the influences
                  of Divine grace, and was soon to make the minister glad by avowing his intention
                  to forsake the ways of sin.
               One beautiful Saturday night, to the surprise of all present except the faithful
                  pastor, Billy came into the class-meeting. A deep and earnest seriousness pervaded
                  his countenance, and burying his face in his hands, he soon seemed lost to all
                  around him.
               The exercises were nearly finished, When Dr. Richmond, the leader, addressed him.
                  In heart felt accents, and trembling with deep feeling, Billy expressed his
                  conviction of his lost state, and of his need of a Saviour, and earnestly
                  entreated all present to pray for him.
               Every heart was melted, and every eye filled with tears. "Father" Harvey urged his
                  way to him, and pressed him to his heart, and with tears coursing down his
                  branched and furrowed cheek, while Billy hung upon his neck, he spoke loving words
                  of Jesus, and of salvation. Billy was a favorite with all who knew him; his open,
                  manly character, his kind, affectionate heart, and his overflowing good-nature
                  made him many friends throughout the neighborhood, And now these Christian hearts
                  loved him more than ever, and every bosom glowed with tenderness and Christ-like
                  sympathy toward him.
               Mr. Arthur proposed prayer, and each heart responding to its own impulses, bowed
                  low, and poured out supplication and intercession in behalf of the broken-hearted
                  penitent.
               Billy arose comfortless. Words of encouragement were addressed to him; he was
                  directed anew to the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world; again the
                  class knelt in prayer, but no ray of light penetrated the gloom of that sorrowful
                  spirit, and all arose and reluctantly departed to their homes.
               Many times during the night the stricken penitent arose to pray. At length Sabbath
                  morning dawned, as clear and as calm as a morning in paradise. But to the mourner
                  for his sins the heavens seemed hung in black. O, how bitter was the consciousness
                  that sin had separated him far from God.
               
               The services of the church commenced with a love-feast, and the orphan boy was
                  early in the sanctuary. One single ray of hope gleamed in upon his shrouded heart
                  during the love-feast, and he trusted his deliverance was not far distant. But the
                  day and the evening passed away, and Billy had not once left his place in the
                  church. Still that spirit struggled with unbelief, and the strife grew mighty. He
                  was the last to go home, and when he went it was not to rest.
               At midnight he arose from his couch, where he had been tossing in agony of spirit,
                  went into the open fields, and, falling prostrate before his Maker, he solemnly
                  renounced his sins, and all hope in himself. "I am lost I am lost!" he exclaimed,
                  in bitterness. Then a voice was wafted from the hill of Calvary, and it fell in
                  sweetest accents upon his ear: "I have died;" "I that speak in righteousness,
                  mighty to save."
               He repeated again, "I am lost!" but the thought seemed to retain none of its
                  power; and "I have died" came home to his heart with divine power. "Yes," he
                  exclaimed, as he arose from his prostrate position, and fell back again as if
                  renouncing anew all hope in himself, "yes, I am lost; but thou, my Saviour, my
                  Redeemer, hast died! Glory be to God! He came to seek and to save that which was
                  lost, saves me, even me!" 
                     
                        "My God is reconciled;
                        His pard'ning voice I hear:
                        He owns me for his child;
                        I can no longer fear:
                        With confidence I now draw nigh,
                        And Father, Abba, Father, cry."
                     
                  
               
               "God is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself." This precious scripture he
                  repeated again and again. "Reconciling the world unto himself! O, grace divine! O,
                  love beyond compare!"
               Many appropriate passages of the word of God, which he had learned in the Sunday
                  school, were impressed with sweet power upon his heart, and his faith grew
                  strong.
               Then he cast his eyes upon the clear, blue sky above him, and the stars seemed
                  hymning anthems of praise to their Creator. He listened, and the woods and waving
                  fields were softly murmuring the goodness of the Unseen. The hum of insects
                  breaking upon the stillness of that gorgeous summer night, the distant dashing of
                  the mountain brook upon its rocky channel, and the balmy breath of the gently
                  stirring breeze, all had a voice in
                  harmony, a voice of praise and thanksgiving.
               Billy sprung to his feet, and exclaimed, in the fullness of a heart set free from
                  the thralldom of sin, "Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord, who
                  forgiveth iniquity, transgression, and sin. Bless the Lord O my soul, and all that
                  is within me bless his holy name!" and with a renewed heart and a light step he
                  bounded homeward; and through the night-watches angels listened, and waved, and
                  flapped their golden wings with purest bliss, as ever and anon a clear burst of
                  praise rung out from the low-ceiled chamber of the orphan boy.
               Many others, soon after, pledged allegiance to the King of kings, and were taken
                  into covenant favor with him. There was joy in the hamlet, there was rejoicing
                  among the angels in heaven.
               Billy never forgot the place where his spirit breathed the pure air of Eden, the
                  atmosphere of love; and in later years he often repeated the beautiful heart
                  melody of a living son of song: 
                     
                        "There is a spot to me more dear
                        Than native vale or Mountain;
                        A spot for which affection's tear
                        Springs grateful from its fountain.
                     
                     
                        'Tis not; where kindred souls abound,
                        Though that on earth is heaven;
                        But where I first my Saviour found,
                        And felt my sins forgiven.
                     
                     
                        "Hard was my toil to reach the shore,
                        Long tossed upon the ocean;
                        Above me was the thunder's roar,
                        Beneath the waves' commotion;
                        Darkly the pall of night was thrown
                        Around me, faint with terror.
                        In that dark hour, how did my groan
                        Ascend for years of error!
                     
                     
                        "Sinking and fainting as for breath,
                        I know not help was near me;
                        And cried 'O save me, Lord, from death,
                        Immortal Jesus, hear me!'
                        Then, quick as thought, I felt him mine,
                        My Savior stood before me;
                        I saw his brightness round me shine,
                        And shouted 'Glory! glory!'
                     
                     
                        "O sacred hour! O hallowed spot!
                        Where love Divine first found me;
                        Wherever falls my distant lot,
                        My heart shall linger round thee;
                        And when from earth I rise to soar
                        Up to my home in heaven,
                        Down will I cast my eyes once more
                        Where I was first forgiven."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Jesus, let all thy servants shine
                           Illustrious as the sun;
                           And bright, with borrow'd rays divine,
                           Their glorious circuit run.
                        
                     
                     —C. WESLEY.
                  
               
               TWO years passed away, cementing the bond of union between pastor and people, and
                  bearing witness that the Spirit of God was sealing the faithful efforts of the
                  ministry.
               Mr. Arthur and his family then bade adieu to a society, and to scenes around which
                  their hearts lingered with fondness, to go forth again among strangers; and once
                  more the blessings and prayers of a Church followed him
               The members of the Church at the hamlet did not complain of the rules of their
                  Discipline that required the removal of their beloved pastor, though they would
                  have been glad to have retained him with them. The system that required his
                  removal, they reasoned, had furnished their Church with a pastor, such as they
                  could hardly have hoped for under a different system.
               Other societies needed the influence of his deep and enlightened piety and
                  cultivated talents, his wise and well-conducted measures and faithfulness, and
                  therefore they bade him "Good speed."
               The minister had if in his heart to live and die with such a people. But his motto
                  was not "little work, and full pay." Had he reckoned ease and fullness of bread
                  his chief good, he might have murmured, but he had entered the vineyard of the
                  Lord a worker, and he gloried in a system that always furnished every willing
                  laborer full employment, even though there were some inconveniences attending
                  it.
               He thought it was much better for the ministry than to be compelled to stand idly
                  in the vineyard, "because no man hath hired us;" and much better for the people
                  than to be left frequently without a pastor.
               After Mr. Arthur and his family had left the hamlet, Mr. Boynton remarked to his
                  wife, as, they were making preparations for the minister expected from Conference,
                  "I see that we are far from the mark yet. There are many things to be done before
                  we shall be clear in this matter. I see no reason under the sun why the members of
                  Christ's Church should not be as
                  self-denying as the preacher. Who ever said," continued he in his emphatic manner,
                  "that the minister and his family should be more self-denying, more holy, or more
                  ready, to every good word and work than other members of Christ's mystical body?
                  It is true that a dispensation of the Gospel has been committed to them, and they
                  should be holy, eminently so, as guides of the flock of Christ; but does the
                  Gospel permit us to be less holy, less self-denying?"
               "Perhaps, while we have a correct view of the duties and responsibilities of our
                  preachers, we are too apt to overlook our own," replied Mrs. Boynton. "Could we
                  not," continued she, "use a little more self-denial ourselves, and add something
                  more to the comfort and convenience of our minister's family? We might by this
                  means equalize the labor for the promotion of Christ's kingdom on earth more. For
                  my part, I think I am willing, as they have so many inconveniences from which I am
                  free, to divide my luxuries with them; and it would be no more than right to give
                  them the largest share. Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that
                  teacheth in all good things. Is that right?" she added, smiling.
               Mrs. Boynton seldom ventured on quoting a passage of Scripture, and this effort
                  and appeal her husband for correction or affirmation amused him not a little.
               "Yes, it is, Harriet," he exclaimed; "and just like my wife to remember that verse
                  above all others. There is old Mr. Crawford, rich as Crœsus; what is the alpha and
                  omega of his Bible?"
               "O, everybody knows, Daniel, for we have heard it often enough, 'He that provideth
                  not for his own—'"
               "And especially for those of his own household, has denied the faith, and is worse
                  than an infidel," added Mr. Boynton. "He will never forget that; and I suppose
                  when he knocks at the gate of heaven he will hand that over as his ticket of
                  admissions."
               "And will it be accepted, do you suppose, Daniel?" said Mrs. Boynton.
               "Undoubtedly! and, another handed back to him, that will burn into his soul like
                  melted lava: 'No covetous man hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and
                  God.' I do not think it the duty of a church to encumber the ministers of the
                  Gospel with wealth; but a full and easy competency is certainly due to him from a
                  Church whose garners are full. I do not
                  believe in making a minister dependent, in order to keep him humble. The humility
                  of the pauper, it strikes me, is not the true coin."
               Mr. Boynton fully agreed with him in these sentiments; and afterward he labored
                  more than ever to lighten the labors of the ministry, and to insure to them a
                  liberal support.
               Billy Lawrence felt as though his heart would break as his beloved pastor pressed
                  his hand for the last time. He returned hurriedly to his little chamber, overcome,
                  by sorrow, and locked himself in for the day. That day was a turning point in his
                  life. He felt the need of more grace and deeper communion with God. He realized
                  that he had depended on Mr. Arthur too much: his guide, his beloved minister, had
                  left him, and now he must look to the Saviour alone.
               That day he resolved, by the help of God, that he would make the most of himself.
                  It was spring now, and his winter school had closed. Until winter came again, he
                  would work on the farm. Now he formed the plan, which he afterward fully carried
                  out, to review all the studies he had pursued at school, until he had thoroughly
                  mastered them; and to spend his leisure in reading.
               Mr. Winsor, the minister appointed to succeed Mr. Arthur, became acquainted with
                  Billy, and interested himself much in his improvement; lent him books from his own
                  library, and conversed with him freely and familiarly, upon their contents. This
                  was a great benefit to Billy, as it made him more familiar with the works
                  themselves, and also improved his readiness in communicating his thoughts.
               An old man in the neighborhood told Billy one day that he would "lose all the
                  sense he had; reading, reading, reading, every night until midnight." Billy
                  laughingly told the old man that he "might be mistaken, but he thought he was
                  gaining a little 'sense' every day." But Billy was not mistaken, and with such a
                  discipline his mind expanded, and having a keen sense of right, and a conscience
                  quickened by grace, his Christian character developed with symmetry.
               His mind was open to the teachings of truth, and his success in study he
                  attributed in part to the whispered ministrations of angels. He culled knowledge
                  from every circumstance, however trivial it seemed to ordinary minds.
               But above all it was his delight, to behold the Creator in all the works of his
                  skillful hand. From the descending
                  showers, the waving fields, and the flowers of the valley, he was ever drawing at
                  lesson of God's goodness, and loving care of man. The forest trees bowing their
                  stately heads to the passing breeze, reminded him of the power and majesty of the
                  King of kings, to whom all the mighty of the earth owe reverence and worship. The
                  birds, the streams, and the whispering breezes attuned his soul to praise. Shady
                  and secluded nooks invited him to prayer. The evening sky tinted with ruddy glory,
                  was the far-off gleaming of the golden gates to the celestial city. The night
                  spread out her enchanting map for his study, all nature opened to him her rich
                  treasures, and his soul feasted on hidden manna.
               Thus was his time occupied for nearly two years; and it could hardly have been
                  spent more profitably. His improvement had been greater than he was aware of, and
                  when his friends, who had been interested observers of his course, procured for
                  him an exhorter's license, he was on the point of refusing it; but the thought
                  that by so doing he would be placing a higher estimate upon his own judgement than
                  that of his elder brethren, deterred him. This proved an important period in the
                  history of the orphan boy.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               
                  
                     
                        "The night is mother of the day,
                        The winter of the spring,
                        And ever upon old decay
                        The greenest mosses cling.
                        Behind the cloud the star-light lurks;
                        Through showers the sunbeams fall;
                        For God who loveth all his works,
                        Has left his hope with all."
                     
                  
               
               MR. ARTHUR and his family after some inquiries as to the best route to be taken,
                  had found their way to their new appointment with comparatively little difficulty,
                  and had been received without marked neglects or attentions.
               His salary had been fixed by the stewards before his arrival, and was deemed, by
                  them at least, as unalterable as the law of the Medes and Persians. Whether the
                  minister had two, four, or eight children, or no children at all, was not taken
                  into the account. "Children cost nothing." Do not they live on the crumbs that
                  fall from their parents' table? "It will undoubtedly be a 'saving,' if there is
                  one or two!" "And what business has a
                  Methodist minister with more? The sum already fixed is what we can afford to pay,
                  and we can't go beyond it."
               Thus they talked.
               The society, however, was for the most part a loving, pleasant society; the
                  misfortune seemed to be that of improper leaders and stewards; and the other
                  members of the society submitted for the sake of peace.
               The minister and his wife determined, though the prospect looked forbidding, to do
                  the best they could under such circumstances, and hoped the more generous part of
                  the society would comprehend their position, and do what was right.
               Mr. Arthur, therefore, entered heartily into the great work before him, resolved
                  to look on the bright side.
               What if Mr. Grant, the steward, does hand over the preacher's salary to him in
                  fives and tens, as best suits his particular state of feeling? "Does it not teach
                  the minister humility and economy?" Moreover, it is Mr. Grant's cherished
                  peculiarity, and he enjoys it; that is, as well as he is capable of enjoying
                  anything.
               But a more perplexing question occurs: What is to be done if Mr. Grant, who keeps
                  a little grocery store, insists on it that the minister must buy of him according
                  to the rule? and because Mr. Grant withholds the minister's salary, and the
                  minister must, therefore, buy on credit, what is to be done if Mr. Grant charges
                  an extra profit and furnishes a poorer article? And what, if, with a great stretch
                  of liberality, Mr. Grant puts his name down for fifty dollars, to be taken "in
                  store pay?" Is that to be reckoned fifty dollars in making up the preacher's
                  estimate? or forty, which would be the full value received? Must the minister take
                  a poorer article, and overpay for it, in order to fulfill the rule, buying one of
                  another and helping each other in businesses?" But the "help" here is evidently
                  "all on one side;" and the minister would rather have forty dollars in cash than
                  Mr. Grant's fifty in "store pay." He would rather make Mr. Grant a present of ten
                  dollars, and in that way "help him in business," than to take often such articles
                  as he did not want.
               And then, what if old Mr. Simon, with his broad acres and narrow breast, who gives
                  yearly into the Church treasury "two dollars in money and one dollar in produce,"
                  does shrug his shoulders, and smile
                  with self-complacency as he reminds any new solicitor of his bounty of that
                  important fact, and begs them "not to ride a free horse to death?"
               These are some of the actors in life's drama; and we must necessarily meet them
                  sometimes. Christianity has a very feeble hold upon such hearts. The Divine
                  precepts of the Gospel, overflowing with love and good-will to man, have hardly
                  made an impression upon them. If the good seed has been sown in their hearts, the
                  fruits are scarcely visible; and while they keep them thus closed to Divine
                  influence, there is no hope that they will bear fruit unto eternal life.
               Thus the minister and his wife reasoned, though a sense of the injustice of such a
                  course was not pleasant.
               Mr. Grant could not always calculate how long the doled supply would last, or when
                  it was most needed; and the minister's family were therefore subjected to many
                  inconveniences.
               Faithful Nancy, the good and pious nurse that had been furnished Mrs. Arthur by
                  the thoughtful attentions of the people at the hamlet, and who had determined not
                  to leave Mrs. Arthur, to whom she had become much attached, "wondered if nothing
                  could be done."
               When she was informed by the minister's wife, that "something might probably be
                  done, but perhaps greater annoyances would be the result," she replied, that the
                  bishops ought to proclaim a day of fasting and prayer, that all societies who have
                  such leaders and stewards might be freed from them.
               "I don't want their days to be shortened, though," said Nancy, "for I'm thinking
                  they're not quite ready; but may be they would be a little seared, and do
                  better."
               Nancy had not forgotten the noble-hearted little band at the hamlet; and, the
                  contrast did not raise her new acquaintances much in her estimation.
               Near the close of the year Mr. Grant made what he called a desperate effort to
                  bring up arrearages. A donation visit had previously been given, every article of
                  which, contrary to the design of the donors, this faithful steward of the property
                  of the membership had prized, in order to help to make out the preacher's
                  estimate. Still there was a deficiency.
               The entry on Mr. Grant's "account book," of Mr. Simon's "one dollar in produce," which was always thoughtfully reserved
                  for this very occasion, was by no means omitted. A half bushel of potatoes, a half
                  bushel of turnips, a peck of corn-meal, figured quite conspicuously on one of its
                  pages; and, moreover, showed some knowledge of book-keeping.
               But in spite of all these praiseworthy exertions of the persevering steward, who
                  was so careful that the members of the Church should not squander their substance,
                  and that the minister should be alike economical, Mr. Arthur found his liabilities
                  were considerably beyond his income. He therefore made known these facts to the
                  "powers that be."
               But Mr. Grant is sure "not another dollar can be obtained;" he "had made a
                  wonderful effort to procure what" he "had; and had been obliged to do so for the
                  last fifteen years." "Moreover," he had "seen 'Brother' Simon, the richest man in
                  the society, and he is of the opinion that the society has done
                     wonderfully, and would complain if further application should be
                  made to them. Indeed," he could "do no more."
               Mr. Arthur returned home, after listening to this speech, resolved to let the
                  matter rest for a few days. But others were interested in the result.
               The wife and daughter of Mr. Grant had heard the conversation, and their
                  resolution was at once taken. They knew better than any one, how resolutely
                  attached to his peculiarities and opinions was the husband and father, and
                  therefore kept their plan to themselves.
               The next day they started out in different directions, and when they met again in
                  the evening each had nearly fifty dollars in her purse, which had been taken with
                  them empty in the morning.
               Matilda told her mother that she was resolved to make hers fifty from her own
                  supply, and added that she "had last year lost two dollars from her purse, which
                  she firmly believed should have been paid to the minister, and because she had not
                  done so, she had lost it."
               Her mother agreed to do the same. For the morrow they could not wait; they were
                  too happy not to be in haste, and they hied away to the parsonage.
               They were a little nervous and restrained; the minister and his wife both observed
                     this,
                   and fifteen minutes had not passed away before they arose to depart.
                  They had intended to have told the minister of their success, and to have enjoyed
                  the pleasant surprise of the family; but their hearts fluttered a good deal, and a
                  choking sensation prevented them from articulating a single sentence; they
                  therefore threw the purse into Mrs. Arthur's work basket, and abruptly
                  withdrew.
               "Look here! what do you think of this? Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt
                  thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed," said Mrs. Arthur, with a
                  beaming countenance and a grateful smile, as she counted the bank bills. "What do
                  you think of this, my dear?"
               "The Lord never forsakes his laborers, Mary. That is what I think," replied Mr.
                  Arthur pleasantly.
               "Well, I declare," exclaimed Nancy. "Who would have thought it? There is, after
                  all, some hope for Mr. Grant, and he has got such a wife!"
               Mr. Arthur remained the second year in this village, and before he left there was
                  a visible improvement in the interest felt by the people in the welfare of their
                  pastor. They rallied around him, and fully met all his expenses and necessities,
                  and did not leave all to be arranged by the most penurious men in their society.
                  Though Mr. Arthur was much beloved by the people, yet they did not forget their
                  duties to the minister expected from Conference, and at Mr. Arthur's suggestion,
                  and with his hearty cooperation, they entered upon preparations for his
                  reception.
               Mr. Arthur and his family then left for a new station, about fifty miles distant.
                  Here he found a Church without a parsonage, and was subjected to much trouble in
                  procuring a house for his family. But after the inconveniences of boarding three
                  weeks, "baby," five children, and all, in a family where they had the same
                     number and one more, without the
                  opportunity of opening their trunks, or boxes, for necessaries; and then, after
                  the society had collected together the articles of furniture that belonged to the
                     unbuilt parsonage, and which had been stored in the vestry, in
                  "Brother Smith's garret, in Sister Brown's cellar and square chamber," Mr. Arthur
                  and his family were at last, to their great joy, once more in an itinerant's
                  home.

               THE following summer Mr. and Mrs. Arthur, Addie and Charlie—poor little fellow, he
                  was "nobody but Charlie now"—for his little sister Addie, whom Charlie had thought
                  hardly "worth raising," had, without an idea of "woman's rights" ever entering her
                  little head, deposed her brother, and placed herself at the head of affairs, where
                  she reigned so supremely and securely that not one of the household questioned her
                  right to subject all to her wishes. In the same manner Charley had served his
                  brother Frank, and, of course, he has now no right to complain—the following
                  summer the minister and his wife, with
                  Charlie and Addie, accompanied by the constant Nancy, set out for
                  camp-meeting.
               Mrs. Arthur had not attended one since her marriage; but as the brethren and
                  sisters greatly desired her presence, as well as the labors of her husband, she
                  resolved to go.
               They had baskets filled with edibles, enough to satisfy twice their number during
                  their stay, with all other necessaries in the same proportion.
               Mrs. Arthur had not forgotten the golden rule of camp-meetings, which, for the
                  benefit of the uninitiated, we will give: "Carry two plates, lend them both, and
                  go without yourself."
               "Or eat on the grass," added Nattie.
               Mr. Arthur thought this "the golden rule embellished."
               Marian suggested that "to make sure of one, then each had better take three."
               To which Nancy replied, that "it would make no difference, for everybody is
                  expected at camp meeting to entertain other people on their own dinner."
               "Nancy would be the last one to refuse hers," said Mrs. Arthur.
               "And it may be so," said Nancy; and the annoying thought left her.
               
                  
               
               Nancy could not long retain hard feelings toward any one; however, she could
                  hardly forgive the society for not making preparations to entertain their minister
                  at the camp-meeting; she was sure every
                  other society would do it for their minister; "and would we not give them extra
                  service for a whole week?"
               In spite of her efforts to banish these unpleasant reflections, they would intrude
                  themselves upon her, simple-minded woman that she was.
               But after they arrived at the "ground," and Nancy had been down to the preachers'
                  "stand," and heard the evening sermon, she could "see something good in every
                  body;" even in Simon, whom she could never before think of without feeling her own
                  heart shrivel.
               The charity that never faileth, had sprung up anew in her heart. After that
                  Nancy's dinner and her plates were the property of the "meeting." And though the
                  selfish might take advantage of her generosity, yet she had an inward satisfaction
                  to which they were strangers, and in the exercise of this spirit she became more
                  and more like Him who "is kind to the unthankful and the evil."
               The next morning Charlie, who was taking a famous run-around the "big yard," came
                  bounding toward his father and mother, in high animation.
               "Father! mother! Nancy! look here!" he exclaimed, in a breath. "Billy Lawrence!
                  Billy is here!" And away he went.
               Mr. and Mrs. Arthur arose, and went to the tent door. "Sure enough, Billy is
                  coming, and Charlie is tugging him forward by the hand, in his eagerness and
                  delight."
               Mr. Arthur embraced him warmly, and Mrs. Arthur greeted him with tears glistening
                  through smiles.
               Billy's sympathies and affections were like the upswelling of a never-failing
                  fountain, and he threw his arms around Mr. Arthur's neck, and pressed him warmly
                  to his heart. He could not help it.
               Nancy then came forward: "Why, bless your sweet soul, Billy!" exclaimed she. "Now
                  I am paid for coming to camp-meeting. I never expected to see your happy face
                  again. I want to kiss you, as I used to when you was a boy." Nancy had nursed
                  Billy before his mother died.
               Billy was as much a boy now as ever, only a little larger; and, with great
                  heartiness, he exclaimed, laughing, "So you shall, Nancy;" and, returning the
                  salute, he implanted a rousing kiss Upon her wrinkled cheek.
               Nancy had always insisted on it that "Billy would be somebody," though no one ever
                     expressed pressed a contrary
                  opinion. When she heard him telling Mr. Arthur that Mr. Hatfield had given him his
                  time, and he was expecting to go to the Conference Academy the coming winter, she
                  declared, "Well, that is what I always said."
               Mr. and Mrs. Arthur were very much pleased with Billy's improvement, and gave him
                  their encouragement, and assisted him in maturing his plans.
               As he arose to leave, Mr. Arthur placed ten dollars in his hand, wishing him to
                  add it to the little amount he had already laid by for the expenses of the
                  following winter.
               "No, no, Brother Arthur," said Billy, as he gently pushed back his hand.
               "Brother Billy," replied Mr. Arthur, smiling, "this is a part of the proportion of
                  my income that I devote to the Lord. I know not how I can appropriate it to a
                  better use. You know my plan, Billy. Take it as you would from an elder brother.
                  It will assist you a little."
               Billy then received it, smiling.
               Mrs. Arthur enjoyed the camp-meeting much. Good Sister Cole would have Charlie
                  with her, and Nancy took charge of Addie.
               For their meager accommodations she cared not. She could not appreciate that false
                  sensibility that cannot endure the rough and homely fare of the crowd at
                  camp-meeting, but is in ecstasies at a "clam-bake," a "harvest home," or a
                  "circus;" nor the affected sneers of the would-be refined, who affect to pity the
                  vulgar taste of the pious worshiper, and are all admiration of those ladies who
                  follow their liege lords to the battle field, and share the rough fare of
                  soldiers' quarters.
               Mrs. Arthur knew such sneers were prompted by the enmity of the human heart; to
                  God and religion, and not by any peculiar distaste to the homely, conveniences of
                  the meetings.
               She remarked to Mr. Arthur one day: "Let a course of popular lectures be announced
                  for a summer entertainment in the grove, and it would be considered 'a most
                  splendid affair' to spend a week in such a manner."
               The pastor and his wife labored earnestly and faithfully, not only for the company
                  from their own charge, but the thoughtless young stranger thanked and loved the
                  preacher who took an interest in his welfare.
               Mr. Arthur had an opportunity for personal effort in preaching, which he had long
                  desired, The time and circumstances were favorable,
                   every one expected it, and he pressed Divine truth home upon every
                  heart. His society was quickened, and their dormant zeal aroused. Several
                  professed faith in the Saviour, who had been regardless of God; and many felt that
                  they were converted anew, and rejoiced again in all the fullness of their first
                  love.
               That it was the duty and privilege of his Church to live constantly in the
                  enjoyment of the evidence of sins forgiven, the pastor knew; but all did not live
                  thus, and he was glad they were willing to spend a week in Divine worship.
               "They might do this," he said, "at their homes, but the human heart needed
                  arousing; the weak in the faith need many helps; and if they stumbled, they needed
                  the strong arm of some Greatheart to steady their tottering steps."
               Two friends of Mr. Arthur's were deploring the number of backsliders they found
                  every year at camp-meeting. But Mr. Arthur gave it as his opinion that the number
                  was usually much overestimated.
               "Some, without doubt, deceive themselves," said he; "and, of course, soon fall
                  away. Others, filled with the joys of sins forgiven, think they shall never lose
                  their rapturous feelings; but the human heart is incapable of long-continued
                  emotion. When the mind of the young convert subsides from this emotional state,
                  which it must necessarily soon do, he is alarmed, and thinks he has deceived
                  himself. Satan then assaults him with malicious skill; and unless he is favored
                  with the counsel of some experienced Christian friend, he casts away his
                  confidence, is brought again into bondage, and comes the following year to
                  camp-meeting, not a backslider, as he often inappropriately styles himself, but a
                  feeble Christian, who has been robbed of his defense, and is sighing in his inmost
                  heart; '0 that I knew where I might
                  find Him!' even 'Him whom my soul loveth.' He then renews his consecration vows,
                  receives encouragement and counsel from the experience of others, and goes on his
                  way rejoicing."

               SOME one asked Mr. Arthur if he did not think the usefulness of camp-meetings was
                  lessening, and the interest in them was subsiding.
               "I have heard the same inquiry made for the last fifteen or twenty years," replied
                  Mr. Arthur; "but instead of indications that the interest in camp-meetings is
                  subsiding, it seems to be increasing. The increase of numbers, and the number of
                  new tents that appear every year, are significant facts."
               "Father" Culver, a veteran and a pioneer of Methodism, now drew near and joined in
                  the conversation.
               "Ah, yes, brother!" said he to Mr. Arthur, with whom he was acquainted; "how glad our hearts
                  would have been forty years ago to have such an opportunity as this. We then had
                  to war against those in authority, as well as against the wickedness of the carnal
                  heart. Now, though we dwell quietly in the wilderness and sleep in the woods, yet
                  we have a wily adversary. Opposition has failed, and he changes his tactics. He is
                  as veering as the wind, you know, and changes his manner and points of assault, as
                  will best forward his malicious designs. Now he inflates us with pride, and
                  benumbs us with love of ease, and infuses the soul-withering, deadening influences
                  of unbelief into our hearts, until we are in danger of becoming like Samson shorn
                  of his locks."
               The company were evidently pleased with the remarks, and Mr. Arthur replied:
                  "Father Culver's ideas are very suggestive. That camp meetings are about to be
                  given up, I do not believe. The question with us, then, as ministers of the
                  Gospel, and professing Christians, is, how can we make them the most effectual in
                  accomplishing good? As Father Culver intimates, there is a great and effectual
                  door opened, and there are many adversaries. If the ministers of the Gospel desert
                  their posts now, and leave the work to unskillful hands, they will be responsible
                  for their delinquency."
               "But do you consider this the appropriate work of a pastor?" inquired another.
               "If a pastor's duties are limited to his own parish, perhaps not," responded Mr.
                  Arthur. "But should we ask how little we can do, and do our duty is it not better
                  to ask, how much? The apostle exhorts us 'to be ready to every good work,' and to
                  'be instant in season, and out of season.'"
               The countenance of the old preacher now beamed with satisfaction.
               "That's it, brother!"' exclaimed he. "When I used to go to Conference, I went to
                  look up 'job.'" The old gentleman had been a mechanic. "I did not go wishing for
                  the easiest appointments, and the best pay; and the more work, the better I was
                  suited. Now, my son Jeremiah has just entered the itinerant ranks, and he has
                  pretty close rubbing sometimes, but he has plenty to do. And I tell him these are
                  just the places for him; and I believe the boy thinks so too."
               "You have seen pretty hard fare yourself sometimes, I dare say," remarked a
                  gentleman present.
               
               "O, nothing to brag of," replied Father Culver. "I have had much better fare than
                  my old associates, who tried to dissuade me from becoming an itinerant. They told
                  me I might be rich and respectable if I would stick to my trade; and when I sold
                  out I had a pretty fair start, something to fall back upon when I was on a poor
                  circuit; but they said, if I became a circuit rider, the could see just how I
                  should look on an old white skeleton of a horse astraddle my rusty saddle-bags,
                  all the property I should have in the world."
               The company looked around on each other smiling, and the old itinerant, who really
                  loved to talk, continued:
               "Well, sometimes I have had less than that; but I never saw the time that I
                  desired to leave the work I have been engaged in, or a regret that I undertook it;
                  nor would I wish to change places with my old comrades; poor fellows, they turned
                  out badly." And he drew a sigh as he remembered his old associates who had
                  deliberately chosen the ways of sin, and were already reaping its bitter
                  fruits.
               "You have fared better," said another.
               "I!" said the old man, his face radiant with serene joy; "the Lord has had his eye
                  on me. 'Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life
                  that now is, and also that which is to come.' I have always been provided for. Our
                  Churches were poor when I first started in the ministry; The people used to affect
                  pity for the poor Methodist families where we used to put up, and say that the
                  circuit riders and their horses would 'eat them out of house and home;' and
                  perhaps there was danger of it, added he, with a pleasant twinkle of the eye; "but
                  we were determined that the people should have the Gospel. We preached, and our
                  people divided their loaf with us, and the Lord blessed both them and us. In spite
                  of the prophecies of the enemies of the Gospel, they grew rich. 'The Lord blessed
                  the house of Obed-edom, where the ark of the Lord rested.' And who will say those
                  good brethren and sisters did not enjoy the especial favor and blessing of heaven.
                  I believe it, and the world goes well with me too."
               "We are not to understand by that, Father Culver, that you are rich?" said Mr.
                  Arthur.
               "Rich? No," replied he; something better than riches though. However, money would
                  be very convenient to me sometimes. My only deposit is in the bank of Divine
                     Providence. When I was fifty years
                  old I said to myself, 'I am now fifty, and must soon begin to descend the hill of
                  life toward its setting sun; and if, in growing old, I must grow morose, and
                  fault-finding, and uncharitable, I pray God to take me hence now.' I am now
                  approaching fourscore, and I often hear my younger brethren praying, that 'Father
                  Culver's last days, may be his best days;' and their prayers are answered, for
                  they are."
               "You find the Lord a sure anchor in old age," said one of the preachers.
               "Have I not his bond who never fails? 'To old age I am he; and to hoar hairs will
                  I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver
                  you?" replied the superannuate with animation.
               "Your confidence is in God's providence," said a brother; but are you never afraid
                  that the Church, to whose keeping the Lord has committed you, will forget you, and
                  neglect their trust, so that you may be left to suffer?"
               "Never," responded he, emphatically; "so long as my faith is in God. Or suppose
                  they should? I tell you my Master will send the ravens to feed me, if it is
                  necessary, and no good thing will he withhold from me. Now let me tell you how the
                  Lord takes care of his old servants. I earnestly desired to come, to this
                  camp-meeting. I wanted to shake my brethren by the hand; I wanted to hear the
                  glorious sound of the Gospel ranging through the forest, and to hear the shout of
                  new-born souls once more; for I shall soon be gone, and this to me is the sweetest
                  music on earth. A friend lent me five dollars, to bear my expenses, for I had no
                  money; but I had not been here a day before one brother left a bank note in my
                  hands, and another did the same, and now I can pay that man when I go home. I do
                  not tell you this to let you know how poor I am," he added, "but to magnify the
                  goodness of God to an old itinerant, who is nearing the port, yes, just ready to
                  step upon the other shore, so near that"—and he commenced singing in a low,
                  tremulous voice: 
                     
                        "'Sounds of sweet melody fall on my ear;
                        Harps of the blessed, your voices I hear;
                        Rings with the harmony heaven's high dome;
                        Joyfully, joyfully, haste to thy home.'"
                     
                  
               
               The company wept like children, and when he arose to depart, several of the
                  ministers crowded around him, and by the nervous tumbling of his hand into his
                  pockets we knew the results, and soon
                  he passed on, still singing in sweet voice: 
                     
                        "'Death, with thy weapons of war lay me low,
                        Strike, king of terrors, I fear not the blow:
                        Jesus hath broken the bars of the tomb;
                        Joyfully, joyfully, will I go home.'"
                     
                  
               
               Billy Lawrence had been listening to the conversation, though he took no part in
                  it. He considered himself a learner, and eagerly drank in very word of the old
                  itinerant.
               When he left, Billy darted out of the back entrance of the tent, and passed
                  rapidly down in the direction the old gentleman had taken. He came out ahead of
                  him, and modestly giving the veteran his hand as he came up, left in it the bank
                  note Mr. Arthur had given him, and without awaiting his thanks, or heeding the old
                  preacher's "Nay, my son," he was soon out of sight.
               Mr. Arthur saw it, and it pleased him much. "William is determined to help
                  himself," said he; "and I honor him for it."
               "God bless the boy," murmured the old preacher. "God bless him," he repeated many
                  times, with much emotion, while tears filled his mild blue eyes; and he passed on,
                  still invoking blessings upon the head of the pure-minded, generous erous youth,
                  who had thus remembered and spoken kindly to an old man in his infirmities and
                  dependence.
               "We may have outlived our usefulness," mused the old preacher; "indeed, it is
                  perhaps true, but my brethren are kind, very kind; they make me forget that I am
                  an old man, and dependent. Bless their souls, they are kind." And again his voice
                  was heard faintly: 
                     
                        "'Bright will the morn of Eternity dawn;
                        Death shall be banished, his scepter be gone;
                        Joyfully then shall I witness his doom;
                        Joyfully, joyfully, safely at home.'"
                     
                  
               
               "There is something wrong somewhere, Brother Arthur," said a portly-looking man,
                  whose countenance indicated a "heart open southward;" "there is something wrong
                  somewhere;" and the ex-governor brought his gold-headed cane to the ground, as if
                  he meant to fasten the remark somewhere. "This is not right," he continued; "there
                  are few such men left among us, and surely the Church should not consider them a
                  burden; and they ought not to be left to feel their dependence in this manner. It
                  is crushing to every feeling of our nature. I wonder our old preachers are not
                  morose, and crabbed, and penurious."
               
               
                  
               
               They would be if they did not live in the sunshine of heaven, said Mr. Arthur.
               "Two hundred dollars per annum, or so," continued the ex-governor, as he drew a
                  copy of the Minutes of the Conference from his pocket. Two hundred dollars for
                  himself and wife and perhaps an invalid daughter dependent on him—perhaps more
                  than one. Half of that sum, at least, goes for house-rent and fuel; and what a
                  pittance is there left for clothing and sustenance!"
               "Would that sum pay the board of two for a year?" inquired his friend.
               "Not unless they should go into a very cheap boarding-house. But to board, and be
                  our boarders! do you know what that means, Howland? Well, I do. Such men and women
                  as those dependent on the cool courtesies of a boarding-house, and stipulating
                  with their land-ladies for leave to invite their friends to see them at so much
                  per head!" Men who deserve a monument, to perpetuate their virtues and
                  self-denials."
               The ex-governor was a man of wealth, and a Christian. He had food for reflection,
                  and he reaped from the multitude.
               "Suppose we should do it," he soliloquized; "suppose we should! There are wealthy
                  men enough in this Conference; suppose each of us, or if we have not the ability
                  to do that, suppose two or three of us unite together, select our
                  man, and send him a certificate of an annuity for life. We should be the better
                  for it. The thought of it makes me feel warm about the heart! I am not sure but
                  that I am growing rich too fast; the effects of it I can already see upon myself
                  and my children. It is possible, hardly possible, that I may not stumble and fall,
                  though there are wrecks all around me. I am less spiritually minded now than I was
                  when a poor man; and I will throw off the weight that makes my steps unsteady. 'Wait until I am dead!'
                     No; I want the heart-opening influences of it while I live: I need
                  it, for I am clogged, fettered, with the love of the world, and feel its chains
                  growing still heavier upon me, I will, therefore, emancipate myself while, I have
                  the power to do it: by the help of God, I WILL. 'The Church does not do her duty.'
                  No; neither have I done mine. Suppose they shuffle off responsibility, I will do
                  so no longer. My soul is near heaven now; and how refreshing and soothing its air!
                  How clearly do I see the path of duty! God has made me a steward of his goods; by
                  his help, I will try and prove myself worthy of the trust. But I fear as soon as I
                  am immersed in business my spiritual vision will again become dimmed, and I shall
                  be calling God's gifts mine, and shall again hug my chains about me.
                  No; before God I will now, while my heart is warm and my spiritual vision clear,
                  pledge myself to bestow yearly, as long as I live, a tenth at least of my income,
                  to religious purposes. God give me a heart to do more than this."
               The ex-governor was a better man from that day, and the wealth of his coffers,
                  that had been changing his own heart into metal, and was cursing his family, and
                  shutting out God and heaven from his sight, now flowed forth in many channels, and
                  instead of maledictions, the scattered hordes opened their dumb mouths in
                  blessings.
               "I have had a good camp-meeting," Mrs. Arthur wrote in her journal on her return
                  home. "I have seen the youth binding on shield and buckler, full of vigor and
                  hope, strong in heart, and lofty in purpose, making ready for the conflict. I have
                  also seen the hoary-headed veteran of the cross on the distant shore of life's
                  ocean, waving back adieus to his companions in convict, as he triumphantly nears
                  the harbor of the Eternal city. A radiant bow arching his horizon reveals in
                  golden letters the prophecy and its fulfillment, 'At evening time it shall be
                  light.'"

                           Yet we have wealth we would not give
                           For all their world of gold.
                           We revel not in corn and wine,

                           Manna divine; then we'll not pine.

                     —GERALD MASSEY.
                  
               
               ONE finer morning toward the latter part of July, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur started for
                  a village about eight miles distant, to spend the day at Rev. Mr. Barton's, who
                  had charge of a circuit in that section of the country.
               Their route led them through beautiful and varied scenery. Now it conducts them
                  beside the deep, narrow, noiseless, stream, screened by lofty hemlocks and sighing
                  pines; now it passes through waving intervals of wheat, and clover meadows, and
                  fertile fields of Indian maize; again it winds along, hiding itself among little
                  hills, upon which cattle are grazing; and suddenly it seems lost again in the
                  primeval forest. Now they hear the dashing of a water-fall, and an
                  overhanging cliff looks down menacingly upon them, and at length they abruptly
                  emerge from what seemed to them labyrinthine paths, and now the beautiful village
                  is spread out before them as upon a chart.
               A half-grown boy, sleepily lounging with his dog at the foot of a tree, pointed
                  out the house of the clergyman, and a few minutes brought them to his door.
               
               Mrs. Arthur and Mrs. Barton had been school-mates, and had not met since they bade
                  each other "good-by," in the hall of the boarding-house, at the close of their
                  last term at school.
               Their meeting was as cordial and unaffected as in the days of their girlhood.
                  Several years had passed since then, but these true women seemed hardly to have
                  noted them. "The good grow not old;" and it was certain that the hearts of these
                  sweet-minded women still exhaled the fragrance of their springtime.
               The clergyman soon repaired to Mr. Barton's "Bethel," a charming little spot at
                  the top of the hill, in the rear of the preacher's house. The ascent to it was
                  steep, and had been difficult; but the construction of a few steps by the minister
                  had rendered it comparatively easy. It was a place upon which the eye of Heaven
                  ever seemed to look approvingly.
               Mr. Barton had spent many happy hours there alone with his Maker. Thither he was
                  in the habit of carrying his books and manuscripts, and a desk rudely constructed
                  answered the double purpose of secretary and pulpit. There he studied, wrote, and
                  read aloud; there he meditated, prayed, and sung. It had often been to him as its
                  name indicated, "the house of God, and the gate of heaven."
               The clergymen enjoyed the day so well here, that they had been unconscious of the
                  flight of time, and were surprised to see the signal for their return floating
                  from the parsonage window so soon.
               The time had passed equally pleasant with the ladies. They had not only lived over
                  again their school days, those glad days, unclouded by sorrow, but the intervening
                  years, with all their enjoyments, anxieties, and perplexities, had passed in
                  review.
               They amused each other with a recital of their habits of economy; of the old made
                  new; of the in-outside, or out-inside garments, growing "small by degrees and
                  beautifully less" each year; of the abstinence, promotive of health, of course,
                  that they had sometimes practiced; and they finally concluded that they had led as
                  happy lives as had their school-mates, who had married wealthy and possessed an
                  easy independence in fashionable life.
               The ladies were without doubt correct in their conclusion, though they arrived at
                  it by no logical process of reasoning.
               Their hearts were incased by no shell of selfishness, shutting, out the warm sunshine, which would insure life, and
                  expansion, and germination; but they were keenly alive to the tenderest
                  sympathies, and throbbing with desires to do good.
               These Christian women were happy in being a blessing to other's; happy in the
                  purest affections, in heavenly charity, and in the consciousness that they were
                  not living for themselves alone.
               Earth's gilded toys are too trifling to satisfy the desires of an immortal mind
                  upon which the Divine Spirit has left its impress, and are not a fit reward for
                  the servants of the King immortal. Let those sigh for ease and for wealth who
                  would be satisfied with the reward they proffer.
               The day closed happily, and in the cool of the evening our friends returned
                  home.
               A few days after, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur were seated in a little vine-covered arbor,
                  close by their house, which had been fitted up by Sister Eliza, and Calista
                  Kidder, and their brother, Hamlen, "on purpose to please the minister and his
                  wife."
               It was evening. Charlie and Addie, grown chubby and strong under the kind
                  watch-care of Nancy, and plenty of out-of-door exercise, had fallen asleep while
                  lisping their evening prayer. Jennie and Frankie were tumbling on the grass, and
                  watching the shallows that were twittering under the eaves of a neighboring barn;
                  and Marian and Nattie were apart, talking of Billy Lawrence and their friends at
                  the hamlet.
               I have been thinking much of Sister Barton," said Mrs. Arthur to her, husband,
                  "since our visit to her. She was a heroic-hearted girl. Her bright, sunny gayety,
                  and graceful, winning manners, made her a favorite, and she was much admired. More
                  than one suitor for her band was doomed to disappointment, though they offered her
                  wealth, position, and ease; but her earnest nature deeply imbued with religious
                  truth, thirsted after something better."
               "And so she chose a Methodist minister," said Mr. Arthur, playfully.
               "Ah, you are quick to appropriate the compliment, Mr. Arthur!" returned the
                  minister's wife, gayly: "but I was about to say she desired a situation in life
                  where she could be more useful than she could possibly be as the wife of a
                  wealthy, worldly-minded man. In such a situation Louisa would not trust herself.
                  Possessed of deep sensibility and a true woman's nature, she feared the influence of the society to
                  which such a relation would introduce her. It is hard for an affectionate, loving
                  heart to say 'No' to the entreaties of their dearest friends."
               "It is Mary," replied Mr. Arthur; "and I am surprised to see with what eagerness
                  pious mothers introduce their daughters into fashionable life. It is a fearful
                  risk they run. Suppose they procure, by this means, splendid matches for them;
                  alas, what a poor exchange for those daughters, who might be angels of life, of
                  mercy, and of light!"
               "Louisa had a little property of her own when she married Brother Barton,"
                  continued Mrs. Arthur, "which she designed to keep to commence housekeeping with,
                  should her husband's location, or his death, ever require it; but she says a part
                  of that amount has been needed for their own expenses each year, on their
                  different circuits, and was all gone more than a year ago. Now, during the past
                  year, she has earned seventy-five dollars with her needle, which has been expended
                  in the family."
               "It is too bad," said Mr. Arthur, with unusual warmth. "Sister Barton pays
                  seventy-five dollars for the support of preaching; and her husband a minister, for
                  whom the people ought to provide! more, probably, than any member on any of their
                  circuits. I think the preacher's family should pay their proportion for the cause
                  of Christ in the earth, and many of them do more, and use some self-denial to
                  accomplish it; but it is the duty of their societies to maintain them: and for
                  them to allow Sister Barton to pay their debts, in that way is marked injustice
                  that must meet a reckoning. You remember our rich Brother Wardlaw, who annoyed me
                  so constantly about the 'poverty of the society,' and required one poor but
                  generous brother to pay as much as himself. I see, by the newspapers, that one of
                  his large manufactories is burned to the ground, and his loss is several
                  thousands. 'When ye brought it home, I did blow it away,' saith the prophet; and
                  also 'I smote you with blasting, and with mildew, and with hail, in all the labors
                  of your hands. Yet ye turned not to me, saith the Lord.' I see more clearly every
                  day that the neglect of the societies to support public worship is not venial. But
                  Sister Barton's record is on high," he added, with deep feeling.
               "I hope and pray her life may be spared for the sake of her dear little boys,
                  until she has left upon them the impress of her own pure and lofty spirit. But few can endure such constant
                  exertion with so much care," said Mrs. Arthur.
               "It is her pure and lofty spirit that sustains her," replied her husband. "An
                  ordinary mind would sink beneath such a weight. It is not the continued physical
                  labor of fourteen hours a day alone; and not unfrequently she goes beyond this,
                  you say, though that is over-work for day-laborers; but she feels the weight of
                  other responsibilities. This over-taxing of body and mind is crushing, These
                  things are overlooked. The Church has not yet waked up to this subject. 'Rome was
                  not built in a day,' nor can we expect to see everything as it should be at once.
                  There has been a very great improvement in a very short time, and we still go on
                  improving. There, have been false teachers, in the world, who have fleeced the
                  flocks, and now the reaction affects even the true shepherds. The Church has gone
                  from one extreme to the other. But the pure spirit of the Gospel will yet bring
                  about the desired results."
               The earnest evening prayer of the minister and his wife, that the Church might be
                  imbued with the spirit of Christ, glorious in beauty, and perfect in all its
                  developments, was recorded in heaven, and sealed with the blood of the Lamb.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Not to myself alone,"
                           The streamlet whispers on its pebbly way;
                           "Not to myself alone I sparkling glide;
                           I scatter life and breath on every side,
                           And strew the fields with herb and flow'ret gay;
                           I sung unto the common, bleak and bare,
                           My gladsome tune;
                           I sweeten and refresh the languid air
                           In droughty June."
                        
                     
                     —S. W. PARTRIDGE.
                  
               
               As winter approached everybody was busy at Mr. Hatfield's. Industrious fingers
                  were plied with redoubled activity, and generous hearts throbbed with expanded
                  benevolence.
               The quickened step and cheerful manner of Martha and Mary told of their interest
                  in the preparations rapidly going forward. Yet theirs was an unselfish interest.
                  William Lawrence, the adopted son and brother, was about to bid adieu to the
                  inmates of the farm-house, and all were anxious to do something for his fitting
                  out. Even Dwight and Emmie, older and larger now than when they cracked nuts for
                  Mr. Arthur, were whispering to each
                  other apart from the rest, intent on some project that seemed to promise them much
                  happiness.
               "Your father says we must give Billy his freedom-suit," said Mrs. Hatfield to her
                  daughters; "and I have been thinking that we can exchange our cloth that is being
                  made at the woolen-mill for a better article. Ours would do very well for common
                  wear, but I want Billy to have something better for a Sunday suit."
               "So do I, mother," replied Martha. "That will be a nice plan. Nobody would have
                  thought of it but you, mother."
               "We want Billy to appear as well as anybody," said Mary. "We do not want the
                  students to be pulling the hay out of his hair, because he is not dressed as well
                  as others."
               "I have no fears for Billy after he gets a little acquainted," said Mrs. Hatfield.
                  "His frank good-nature, his lofty principles, and unaffected piety, will make him
                  friends of those whose friendship is really worth possessing."
               The girls remained silent for a few minutes; and then Martha whispered something
                  in Mary's ear that seemed to receive her full assent. She at length spoke:
               "Mother, could not Mary and I exchange for cloth, to make Billy a cloak, the
                  flannel which we were to have prepared for blankets. I think he will need such an
                  outer garment."
               "He has a good new overcoat now, but perhaps he will not have another for a long
                  time; and we may not have it in our power to assist him again," said Mary. "And
                  then, too, we shall, probably, have an opportunity to get a good number of
                  blankets before we shall need them, mother," she added, with a smile and a look of
                  pleasantry directed toward her sister.
               "You can do so if you wish," said their mother. "Indeed, I think it a very good
                  plan."
               Mrs. Hatfield had recently been questioning the practice of boarding, for future
                  and uncertain use, that which would be a blessing to the widow, clothe the
                  shivering poor, and make many an orphan happy, if dispensed abroad.
               Her closets were bursting out with clothing she did not use a half dozen times
                  during the year; with bags crowded with stockings; and with linen, bedding, and
                  flannels, which her mother had given her when she was a girl, and her own industry
                  had since added to.
               She was a notable housekeeper, and took great satisfaction in these visible marks
                  of her own industry and thrift. She had
                  used them just often enough to keep them well aired, and free from moths; the
                  quantity had grown no less.
               Thoughts of the unclothed poor, trembling like the aspen leaf, had more frequently
                  than ever before intruded themselves upon her. She could hardly reconcile her
                  practice with the spirit of the Redeemer's command, "Let him that hath two coats
                  impart to him that hath none."
               Mrs. Hatfield had the reputation of being a very benevolent woman; but she began
                  to fear that she was far from being a Christian after the apostle's pattern.
                  However, when her conscience was enlightened concerning her duties, she performed
                  them cheerfully.
               She had erred in not opening her heart to conviction; and, consequently, her sense
                  of duty had became faint. She had closed her heart each time that she had closed
                  her closet doors, and dismissed the unwelcome thought of duty from her mind
                  without examining the merits of it. But now the subject was brought home to her
                  understanding; and this little circumstance opened her heart, and her convictions
                  were clear. Now she turned to the right; and after that time, with more truth than
                  ever before, she could say: "When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when
                  the eye saw me, then it gave witness to me; because I delivered the poor that
                  cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The blessing of him
                  that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow's heart to sing for
                  joy."
               The girls were delighted with their mother's approval of the plan, for they loved
                  Billy as a brother. Not as they loved their "little darling brother, Dwight," but
                  as sisters do a grown-up brother near their own age. Hence they were willing to
                  deny themselves to please him, though they rightly considered they were using no
                  self-denial in what they were now doing.
               The plan was made known to Mr. Hatfield in the evening, and met his hearty
                  concurrence; and Billy, not being in the secret, an agreeable surprise awaited
                  him.
               Mr. Hatfield's large trunk, that had occupied the chamber-hall ever since his
                  wedding-day, and had been carefully covered with a piece of green baize to keep it
                  free from dust, was made over to Billy, "almost as good as new."
               The present owner thought it much better. How he prized that trunk! A mother's
                     bureau was never more honored by an
                  affectionate daughter.
               "Billy" had some property on the farm. Mr. Hatfield had given him a young colt two
                  years before, which was now valuable. "Billy" found it hard to part with this
                  beautiful creature, but his mind being made up, he stroked his mane and leaned his
                  head upon the neck of his steed, then reluctantly transferring the bridle to the
                  hand of the purchaser without saying a word, he watched his nimble step until he
                  was out of sight.
               He could hardly bear to look at the money he had received for "Charley," so he
                  quietly deposited it in his trunk, and left it there for future use.
               He also had a yoke of steers, which had been given him when they were calves; for
                  the considerate] farmer liked to encourage boys in this way; he said it tended to
                  make them faithful, and interested in the concerns of the farm. These also found a
                  ready purchaser, and "Billy" felt again that he was parting with pleasant
                  companions. The avails of these, and of several bushels of oats, which he had
                  raised from land given him for cultivation by Mr. Hatfield, made him a
                  considerable sum, the reward of his own industry.
               Dwight had a pet lamb, which, though now four years old, still divided his time
                  between the cows and the children, and disdained to associate with the plebeian
                  flock. Dwight wanted to sell his lamb "out and out," he said, and give his brother
                  the money to buy his books; but "Billy" would not listen to this proposal.
                  However, Mr. Lamb's fleece was also the property of Dwight, and the value of it
                  had been paid to him yearly. Now the little boy insisted that the wool should
                  always be used to make stockings and mittens for his "brother Billy."
               He wanted to do something for his "own dear brother," and there "was but little
                  such a boy as he could do;" but when this grand plan occurred to him, his eyes
                  sparkled, and he went with a hop and a bound out of the house, drumming a tune on
                  his milk-pail.
               Mr. Pet Lamb was in the yard awaiting his coming, and supposing his master was
                  giving him a challenge as usual, closed in with him, and with a single thrust,
                  threw him from his feet and smashed in his pail.
               At any other time this offense would hardly have escaped punishment; but Dwight
                  was on especial good terms with his pet just then, and recovering himself, he
                  shook his battered pail at his
                  opponent, and shouted out: "Come on then, Major; we start even this time."
               "Major" now assumed a defensive attitude, and hooked, and curved, and butted; but
                  Dwight, now seeing the game he was playing, could easily avoid him, and they soon
                  parted as firm friends as ever.
               The day for "Billy's" departure at length arrived. Everything was in readiness,
                  Martha and Mary having arranged his wardrobe to their entire satisfaction. Indeed,
                  they were surprised at the result of their labors. They had not thought it
                  possible to accomplish what they had with so little self-denial and expense.
               Most of his garments they had made with their own hands. The cloak was a handsome
                  one, and had been made without Billy's knowledge, and being the last article
                  placed in his trunk before it was strapped down, an agreeable surprise awaited
                  him.
               The trunk, large as it was, failing to hold all that was designed for it, a box
                  was provided, and that was also filled; for "Billy" intended to "board himself,"
                  and the resolute young man thought he should succeed bravely in that way.
               
                  
               
               The departure of the young student was a great event, not only at Farmer
                  Hatfield's, but throughout the neighborhood. His friends crowded around him, and
                  he had the good wishes and prayers of all who knew him. But no one felt this
                  separation more than Billy himself. His heart swelled, and his bosom heaved with
                  sorrow, when he presented his hand to his foster parents, who had so nobly
                  performed their duty to a lonely orphan, and to his affectionate sisters, and the
                  loving-hearted little brother Dwight.
               He thought he had always loved them, but their recent multiplied acts of kindness
                  and the affectionate interest they had manifested in his welfare, endeared them still more to
                  him.
               As he took his seat in the stage, he again waved a sad farewell to all, and gave
                  himself up to uncontrolled emotion. He was again alone in the world.

                           Nerve thyself for the conflict once again,
                           Poor, trembling heart! The strife is not yet o'er;
                           Triumphant o'er affliction, care, and pain,
                           Arise and try life's rugged path once more.
                           Pause not, for time is precious. Ask not rest—
                           Dream not of that fair island of the blest
                           While the wild waves roar round thee.
                           ——Shrink'st thou from the wild strife?
                           Nay; for the soul has strength to brave the storms of life.
                        
                     
                     —A. WESTON.
                  
               
               SPRING came, and with it another Annual Conference, and another move for Mr.
                  Arthur. Nor them alone. Many were the changes of position in the itinerant army
                  that year; and if any person unacquainted with the workings of the itinerant
                  system, had gone through the length and breadth of that Annual Conference, he
                  would have been surprised to find how few among either preachers or people were
                  dissatisfied with the changes and arrangements.
               The removals of this year brought Mrs. Barton and Mrs. Arthur near each other
                  again, to the satisfaction of both. They were now in the same city, and anticipated much enjoyment in each
                  other's society. Their husbands were both in their first city appointment. The
                  salaries of the preachers were meant to be quite liberal; but the expenses of the
                  first quarter convinced them that they must be very economical and systematic, or
                  the end of the year would find them in arrears.
               "There is one thing that perplexes me," said the lively, energetic Mrs. Barton to
                  Mrs. Arthur, "there is one thing that perplexes me much. I have three boys to take
                  stitches for, you know, besides myself and husband. Our time is so taken up in the
                  city with visiting, making and receiving calls, and in our various religious
                  meetings, that I find it impossible to do my own sewing; and really, with our
                  present salary, we cannot afford to hire it done. You may think this strange,
                  knowing, as you do, that I did not only my own for several years, but considerable
                  for other people."
               "I should think it surprising," replied Mrs. Arthur, "If I were not in the same
                  dilemma myself. My husband was saying this morning that he had had a very
                  imperfect idea of the various demands on a preacher's time in a city appointment;
                  and that his chance for study and improvement is now very much lessened. He says
                  he does not know how he should have succeeded had he been sent here with less
                  experience, or less mental discipline."
               "My husband says the same," replied Mrs. Barton. "He often speaks of his little
                  'Bethel,' on the summit of the hill; you recollect it. But as I was saying, my
                  time is so interrupted I do not know what to do. I do not wish our friends to
                  visit us less, and I am trying to arrange matters so that I can be in the parlor
                  entertaining company, and in the kitchen; making calls among my friends, and
                  making my boys' jackets, at one and the same time; but I have not made it out yet.
                  You see I am trying to make five and five equal twenty," she added, gayly.
               "I see," said Mrs. Arthur; "and that you cannot do it without some extra
                     fives to carry."
               "So I am thinking," said she, as she bade Mrs. Arthur a cheerful good-morning.
               Poor Mrs. Barton! a sad year was that for her, the saddest of her life. Before its
                  close, Mr. Barton had heard his Master's call from the eternal hills, and had gone
                  away to the bright land of angels, leaving his stricken wife and children in a
                  world of sorrow, weeping after him. His elder Brother had sent a convoy of angels to escort him to his Father's
                  land; and, before going away, to the infinite care of his heavenly Father the
                  minister, with unshaken faith, committed the keeping of his beloved family.
               He had seen the widow and orphan children of the faithful minister of the Gospel
                  much neglected, and he asked himself the question, whether his own family were
                  likely to fare any better. For a time, sadness vailed his spirit; but the triumph
                  of Christianity in his heart was finally complete.
               Many words of consolation and cheering hope he breathed into the heart of his
                  weeping wife; and many times he alluded to the "realms of the blest," to "that
                  country so bright and so fair," in words of ardent expectation and holy joy, until
                  the Christian wife bowed in sweet submission to the will of Heaven.
               The dreary, desolate hours spent by the heart-stricken widow we cannot depict. It
                  seemed to her that she should never more see good in the land of the living. If it
                  had not been for her children, she felt that she should sink beneath her
                  afflictions. But what could she do for them? She reflected that she had literally
                  nothing. She was penniless. She could not furnish even a single apartment, where
                  she might take shelter with her darling boys, who now had a double claim upon
                  her.
               The stewards had given her the use of the parsonage, and the full year's salary.
                  This would give her time to look about and make some provision for herself. But
                  what could she do? How often this simple, complex question returned. She had no
                  friends to whom she could appeal for help.
               The separation of her family seemed inevitable; but she earnestly prayed that she
                  might be spared the bitterness of such an hour. Often she detected herself forming
                  plans for removing to the academy from which she had graduated, a light-hearted
                  girl: "there she would keep a boarding-house, and send her boys to school;" but as
                  often the reflection was forced upon her, that the little dowry she had sometimes
                  felt might be needed for such an hour was all gone.
               Sad, lonely days and months were those; days to which the widowed mother afterward
                  looked back with an eye dimmed with tears, and a heart melting with a sense of the
                  watchful care and interposition of Providence. Those hours of weary watchings and
                     anxieties ties were also remembered,
                  as peculiar seasons of preparation for the duties of her future life. "I needed
                  this discipline," said she, meekly; "searching as it has been, I needed it;" and
                  she never afterward forgot who has promised to be a father to the fatherless, and
                  a husband to the widow.
               At last day began to dawn; not a day with out clouds, but a day in which there
                  might be, to a hoping heart, as much sunshine as shadow. A few wealthy men in the
                  city interested themselves in behalf of the deceased minister's family. They
                  agreed to unite and send Mrs. Barton a certificate of an annuity for life, which
                  they accordingly did. This annuity, with what she would receive from the
                  Preachers' Aid Society, would render her circumstances comfortable, and enable her
                  to keep her precious family together.
               O how she pressed them to her heart with increased fondness, and how her heart
                  melted with gratitude to the noble donors, and especially to her Father in heaven,
                  who had disposed them to the generous deed!
               The day that she received this certificate, she ever afterward commemorated with
                  thanksgivings, offerings to the poor, and prayer.
               
                  
               
               But this was not considered enough; other hearts were moved by the beneficent
                  example of those worthy men. Those who had not much to give, seemed in earnest to
                  do what they could. Presents of blankets, and coverlets, and bedding, from
                  over-crowded closets; and album quilts from the girls, and various articles of
                  lesser value from the shopkeepers were highly prized; and years after, when Mrs.
                  Barton was in a situation to assist others, and no longer needed them, some of
                  them were preserved and cherished as precious relics in remembrance of the
                  generous donors.
               
               The circumstances of the widow would now allow her to adopt the plan that had so
                  often recurred to her; and after mature deliberation she concluded this would be
                  the best thing she could do. The education of her sons was now the one great
                  object of her life. In doing this she thought rightly that she should be serving
                  God in her appropriate sphere.
               Mr. Arthur then entered into a correspondence with the Rev. Mr. Emerson, the
                  principal of the Conference Academy; and with his assistance arrangements were
                  made for Mrs. Burton to remove there.
               How different her circumstances and feelings on arriving at the place, from those
                  with which she had left a similar institution a few years before.
               Mrs. Barton was not contented with a life of even comparative ease, while there
                  was so much to be done. To train her sons to become God-fearing and God-serving
                  men, and prepare them for extended usefulness, was her constant endeavor. Nothing
                  that she could do toward the accomplishment of this end was left undone; and she
                  considered no service degrading that helped on the great object she had in
                  view.
               The linens of the gentlemen and the muslins of the ladies passed through her ready
                  hands. Her starching was the clearest, and her ironing the smoothest in all the
                  village.
               But with all this management she scorned penuriousness. Her liberal hand was
                  always open, while she had a penny in it, to those who were more needy than
                  herself.
               Now time flew on with Mrs. Barton almost unconsciously. Her boys were at one of
                  the best schools in all the country, and were making very commendable progress in
                  their studies; and she was not only living comfortably, but laying up a little
                  toward paying their expenses at college, when they should enter there.
               Freely had she sacrificed all in the days of her itinerancy; and how
                  providentially all had been restored. Her faith in God, and her love for his
                  people, had been searchingly tried, and had come forth as gold purified in the
                  fire.

                           There is a joy for every hour
                           That hangs upon the heart:
                           There is a charm whose magic power
                           Drives grief from us apart.
                        
                     
                     —VICTOR.
                  
               
               THE day before the winter term commenced at the Conference Academy, Rev. Mr.
                  Emerson, principal of the Academy, was seated in his study preparing a lecture,
                  when a country youth, just arrived in town, requested permission to see him, which
                  was readily granted. William Lawrence then entered, for it was he, and introduced
                  himself in a becoming manner.
               "Ah! the young friend of my friend Arthur, said Mr. Emerson, as he arose and
                  cordially proffered his hand to the youth; "I am glad to see you, Lawrence."
               The open, hearty, dignified manner of Mr. Emerson, impressed young Lawrence very
                  pleasantly. (There is no change in our friend, only in name, gentle reader; he is
                     "Billy" still.) He at once experienced a sensation of relief from
                  the embarrassment that had been creeping over him a few minutes before, and
                  sentiments of affection and reverence for the man who stood before him sprung up,
                  such as he had never felt for a stranger.
               Happy the instructor of youth who can so soon inspire confidence and personal
                  attachment in the hearts of his students, and happy the student who finds an
                  instructor that can not only inspire such sentiments, but who has the real
                  excellence of character ever after to prove himself worthy of them.
               Mr. Emerson was by nature a nobleman. He had a heart "warm and unspoiled," full of
                  "sympathy for goodness and all simple worth," a true index of unaffected
                  greatness.
               He comprehended the feelings of the youth before him at once. Lawrence was not
                  only a stranger, but he was in circumstances entirely new to him. He was a
                  farmer's boy, fresh from the hills; but he was conscious of strength and
                  integrity, and therefore self-reliant. His naturally quick perceptions and keen
                  sense of propriety had done more for him than he was aware of; there were, in
                  reality, no "fears for Billy."
               "You have arrived in good time, Lawrence," continued Mr. Emerson, pleasantly; "I received a
                  letter from my friend and brother, Arthur, a few days ago, and he mentioned
                  you."
               A slight blush and a smile passed over the face of Lawrence at the latter remark.
                  Mr. Emerson, skilled in reading character, observed it, and as if he were playing
                  with the pen he held in his hand, wrote on a scrap of paper, "William Lawrence,
                  sensitive, modest."
               Lawrence, as keen, though not as practiced in observation, as the dignified,
                  affable man before him, was also forming his opinions. He saw the slight motion of
                  Mr. Emerson's hand in writing those two words, and thinking he might be
                  interrupting him, entered upon his business at once.
               "You wish to board yourself," answered Mr. Emerson, "and would prefer a pious
                  room-mate; well, that is all right; we can arrange for you. There is Harwell, a
                  good fellow; he was here this morning, and wished me to send him a chum; I think
                  you will suit each other."
               After a few minutes' conversation, Lawrence arose to leave.
               "You wish to get settled as soon as possible, I suppose. I will walk over to
                  Harwell's room with you; it is but a few steps," And Mr. Emerson arose, and took
                  his hat and cane, and a short walk brought them to the student's door.
               They found Harwell so immersed in his books that he scarcely observed their
                  entrance. The pleasant, full, voice of the principal aroused him, and, springing
                  to his feet, he received his instructor with filial affection.
               "I have brought you a chum, Harwell. I suppose, after living alone so long, you
                  will know how to appreciate good company," said Mr. Emerson smiling.
               Harwell thought he should, and after a few minutes' pleasant conversation, Mr.
                  Emerson left, saying: "Call at my study, gentlemen, when you have leisure. I shall
                  be glad to see you both. Lawrence, I trust we shall be friends," he added
                  complaisantly.
               Harwell had already attained to that honorable distinction.
               Mr. Emerson soon after re-entered his study, and picking up the scrap of paper he
                  had left, turned to his journal and made an entry: "William Lawrence, sensitive,
                  modest, sensible, thoughtful, prompt, energetic; first impressions.
               Mr. Emerson afterward found no occasion to modify first impressions.
               
               Lawrence found himself in a room about twelve feet square, with bare floor and
                  white-washed walls. It contained a bed, a stove, three chairs, a small
                  looking-glass, an old-fashioned bureau with two drawers and a chest top, which
                  served the purpose of a sideboard. Besides these articles, there were two tables
                  about three feet in length and one in width, with drawers at each end. A few pine
                  shelves, recently fastened against the wall, served as a book-case.
               The new student could hardly see room for his enormous trunk, but Harwell was a
                  practical fellow as well as Lawrence, and had had more experience in these
                  matters, and was more used to close quarters than the youth fresh from orchard and
                  meadow. He could see no difficulty whatever, and suggested one or two simple
                  changes in present arrangements, and then declared their "accommodations were
                  ample."
               Lawrence thought his room-mate a good-natured fellow, and if Harwell could put up
                  with inconveniences, he was sure he could himself, and if they both were careful
                  to retain their good-nature, they might occupy a very narrow apartment, without
                  "running their elbows into each other."
               Harwell opened a closet, and thrusting his scanty wardrobe into one end of it,
                  left the largest half for Lawrence. Then, with a delicate sense of propriety, he
                  left, saying he would be back in an hour.
               This gave Lawrence an undisturbed opportunity to arrange the contents of his box
                  and trunk.
               He opened the trunk first, and, what was his surprise when the new cloak met his
                  view. He took it up, and discovered a little note pinned to it. He read it:
               "From Martha and Mary, in remembrance of the uniform kindness of their brother
                  Billy."
               How the tears blinded, and the swelling of the heart choked the young man then! He
                  read the note again, then put it into his pocket, and burst into tears; then
                  rallying again, he continued his work.
               Here was a half dozen pair of stockings; and another bit of paper fastened to them
                  told him they were made from the wool of Dwight's pet lamb, by his little
                  brother's particular request.
               "Generous little fellow," exclaimed Lawrence, and the tears upwelled again.
               And here was a pair of mittens, "knit by your little sister, Emmie for my darling brother,
                  Billy;" and they were stuffed out with butternut meats, which the same little
                  fingers had picked out for him.
               Now Lawrence could not help laughing.
               And now his hand was upon the well-worn Bible; and he pressed it reverently to his
                  lips. It had been his dayly companion for years; and the sight of its familiar
                  covers was more grateful to him, even at that time, than the cheerful face of a
                  friend would have been.
               And here was a handsome new Bible; and on the fly-leaf was the simple inscription,
                  in Mr. Hatfield's bold, round handwriting: "To my son William; read it dayly as
                  long as you live."
               "I certainly will," responded Lawrence.
               Then he opened his box. Here were Mrs. Hatfield's deposits.
               "How many things she has thought of!" said Lawrence. "What a mother she has been
                  to me! My own mother could not have done more. That she could have loved me
                  better, I do not know. I can just remember how she used to take me into her closet
                  to pray, and then how often I felt her warm tears falling upon my cheek; and I
                  have fancied that I felt her hand again upon my head, and heard her say, as she
                  did just before she died: 'The Lord bless thee, and keep thee; the angel of the
                  Lord encamp about thee, and protect thee.'
               "I saw her once more, as they lifted me up to look upon her pale, cold face; and
                  they wept when they told me I was an orphan! But how have I forgotten that I am an
                  orphan. I love to remember that I had a praying mother; it gives me strength and
                  courage in moments of depression."
               Thus Lawrence soliloquized as he arranged his wardrobe, and the contents of his
                  box. Soon a letter turned up; and this was from Mrs. Hatfield.
               As she had always been free to converse with him on all topics relating to his
                  duties and deportment as a Christian, and he had risen early that morning to be
                  with her as usual while she was preparing breakfast, he exclaimed, "Well, I cannot
                  guess what is here!"
               He read the letter: "Keep the pies in a cool place, Billy. The sage cheese, the
                  dried beef, and the sausages, from too much moisture or dryness. The little jar of
                  butter keep in the cellar, if you can have access to it; place a stone on the cover to prevent the rats from talking
                  a bite."
               "As many traps as I have made and set for those follows, I should never have
                  thought of that," said Lawrence, laughing. "No wonder the stage agent thought my
                  box heavy; and his driver made a bungling pass at wit, when he called it the
                  'sub-treasury.'"
               Lawrence read on: "Dwight thought father had better drive down a cow for you;" and
                  the young student laughed again, and rubbed his hands. "You see Emmie has not
                  forgotten the doughnuts; perhaps you will have a room-mate that will help you to
                  eat them." "That he shall!" exclaimed Lawrence; "for I can't see that he has any
                  supplies except meal, and a mush-pot to boil it in." "Do not stint yourself,
                  Billy; we may have a chance to send you a box before the term closes."
               "Who for?" said Lawrence.
               "The little bag of berries are from Emmie and Dwight. You know Emmie insisted on
                  telling you to prepare dried berries for the table last week."
               "The little darling!" exclaimed Lawrence. "They have thought of everything, and
                  all have done something. I think I might open a house. and take boarders," he
                  added, mirthfully, as he looked around the room. I am glad Harwell is not here,
                  for he would think me a ninny; but I can't help it, they are all so kind to me,
                  and I have no claims upon them."
               No, Lawrence, no: indulge those feelings of generous gratitude, and check them
                  not. It is manly. And Harwell has a soul too, a soul, under that calm exterior, as
                  full of tender home feeling, of expansive sympathies with all that is noble, and
                  generous, and good, as yourself. It will keep your heart young, and afford you a
                  well-spring of constant happiness through all your future life.

                           Rashly, nor ofttimes truly, doth man pass judgment on his brother;
                           For he seeth not the springs of the heart, nor heareth the reasons of
                              the mind.
                           Deep is the sea, and deep is hell, but pride mineth deeper;
                           It is coil'd as a poisonous worm about the foundations of the
                              soul.
                           Give to merit, largely give; his conscious heart will bless thee;
                           It is not flattery, but love; the sympathy of men, his brethren.
                        
                     
                     —TUPPER.
                  
               
               MR. ARTHUR remained in the city four years. During that time many circumstances
                  occurred, some calculated to amuse, others that were annoying, and many that
                  afforded real pleasure, not only for the time being, but years after.
               One day a lady called who had recently become a member of his Church. She was what
                  might be called a good sort of a woman; but, having risen suddenly from obscurity
                  to affluence, her mind had hardly kept pace with her circumstances, so that she
                  was not very well fitted for the station she was endeavoring to fill. Mr. Markham,
                  her husband, had come to the city a few years before, in striped suit, a red
                  cotton handkerchief, containing his wardrobe, all the property he had in the
                  world; but, by tact and speculation, he had succeeded beyond his most sanguine
                  expectations.
               Mrs. Markham's servant came to Mr. Arthur's door soon after, bringing a large
                  bundle, which she left for her mistress, and passed on.
               "I have brought you a few things, Mrs. Arthur," said Mrs. Markham, as she began to
                  unroll the bundle. "Here is a Florence braid. that I thought would make you a good
                  'hack-about,' if it was bleached nice; and here is a ribbon: it is a
                  little soiled, but I think it will do very well to trim it with. Here is a lot of
                  little aprons my children have outgrown, patched a leetle, to be sure, in some
                  places, but a good deal of good wear in them yet. I thought they would just fit
                  your children."
               Mrs. Arthur colored slightly, and her naturally independent feelings rose quickly,
                  but fell as quickly as they rose, and then she could hardly repress a smile.
               "I will take them, Mrs. Markham," replied Mrs. Arthur pleasantly; "and I know"—she
                  stopped when she saw the unconscious, innocent look of Mrs. Markham—"and I know a
                     poor family to whom I should like to
                  give them," she was about to say.
               The lady left soon after, and Mrs. Arthur, too much amused to keep quiet, ran up
                  to the study to communicate her exceeding good luck to her husband.
               Mr. Arthur burst into a laugh that would have exercised "the blues" and might have
                  been thought by some rather unclerical; and knowing Mrs. Arthur's repugnance to
                  being pauperized, he exclaimed "What will you do now, Mary?"
               "I commenced telling Mrs. Markham," said Mrs. Arthur, "that I knew a poor family
                  to whom I should like to give them; but the good woman did look so unconscious of
                  any impropriety in offering such things to me, that I spared her the embarrassment
                  the remark would have occasioned. I think, however, that I ought to make a
                  suggestion to Mrs. Markham on that point. It will be of use to her if she takes it
                  kindly, and I think she will. It is a pity she should not know what is proper in
                  such cases."
               Mr. Arthur remarked with pleasantry, that public opinion was strangely divided
                  with regard to the itinerant ministry, nearly one half thinking them to be a
                  "free-and-go-easy" set of fellows, living on the fat of the land, and the other
                  half believing them to be suffering paupers. "But what is your plan, Mary?" he
                  inquired.
               "I shall send the bundle around to that poor family, and drop a note to Mrs.
                  Markham, telling her what I have done. This will be sufficient, and will save her
                  the embarrassment my presence would occasion, should I do so personally."
               "Well thought of, Mary," said Mr. Arthur, as she glided from the room.
               At another time Mrs. Arthur received a call, which, unlike the former, annoyed her
                  exceedingly. It was from a lady who, with assumed and patronizing superiority,
                  "told the minister's wife in plain terms, that she had thought Mrs. Arthur must be
                  very lonely with so little genteel society as Mrs. Arthur's circle of acquaintance
                  must necessarily contain." Mrs. Preedy, that was the name of the lady, thought
                  Mrs. Arthur must be sighing for kindred spirits; and Mrs. Preedy would be glad to
                  introduce Mrs. Arthur among some of the first families of the city,
                  with whom Mrs. Preedy herself was on the most intimate terms, and
                  they belonged to the same Church with
                  herself; and Mrs. Preedy had called that afternoon to make this proposal to Mrs.
                  Arthur.
               The minister's wife had met before with a class of people, of whom Mrs. Preedy was
                  a very good representative, and she had some knowledge of their forward
                  pretensions, pertinent airs, and their claim to all the piety refinement, and
                  intelligence of the civilized world. She was not therefore the least disconcerted,
                  and her self-possession nettled Mrs. Preedy a little, who thought, of course, the
                  minister's wife would be embarrassed in the presence of a superior, and feel under
                  lasting obligations to her for her condescension.
               "I never find time to feel lonely Mrs. Preedy," Mrs. Arthur replied; "and I am too
                  happy in my family to sigh for genteel or fashionable society. I find kindred
                  spirits everywhere; and the day that I leave off loving, I hope will be my last.
                  My heart claims affinity with everything my heavenly Father has made; and, where
                  there is a chance of elevating a human being, however humble or depraved, there
                  the truly Christian heart will delight to be."
               Mrs. Preedy then tried again. She remarked that she had often seen Mr. Arthur, and
                  thought him "much more like I 'our people' than his own."
               To this Mrs. Arthur made no reply; and Mrs. Preedy added, with a smirk of
                  self-conceit: "I do not know as you will consider that a compliment, but it is
                  intended as such."
               "I do not really see the force of the compliment Mrs. Preedy," replied the
                  minister's wife. "But Mr. Arthur hardly wishes to extend the circle of his
                  acquaintance. He feels the responsibilities of a Christian pastor, and wishes to
                  devote his time to his appropriate work. Perhaps if the itinerant ministry spent
                  more time in making complimentary calls, and in fashionable society, they would
                  bow more complacently and smile more flatteringly; but they would think they had
                  made a sad change. The accomplishment would not be worth the time devoted to its
                  acquirement."
               Mrs. Preedy, seeing she was advancing nothing, then made another rally.
               "Mrs. Arthur," said she, encouragingly, "I have often thought, when I have seen
                  you, what a pity it is that you should be sacrificed to the itinerant system. Mr.
                  Arthur's talents would command a good salary in some of our genteel
                  Churches;" ("Fudge!" thought Mrs. Arthur, but she said nothing;) "and it would be so pleasant to be settled over a
                  beautiful society, and save you so many annoyances, and hardships, and labors.
                  Indeed, I think it cruel that you should be such a slave to your societies."
               "I hardly know what you mean, Mrs. Preedy," said the minister's wife; "I do but
                  little scarcely worth the naming, but it is performed cheerfully,
                  voluntarily."
               "But how a person of refinement and sensibility, like you, must be annoyed"
                  ("Fudge!" thought Mrs. Arthur, again. She had read Goldsmith's Vicar) "with the
                  coarseness of many with whom you come in contact."
               "So I am," thought Mrs. Arthur, as she involuntarily looked out of the window.
               "No station in life is free from annoyances, Mrs. Preedy," replied Mrs. Arthur,
                  with dignity. "The fashionable lady of wealth, and the genteel exclusive, as well
                  as the one whose reversed fortunes render it necessary for her to resort to artful
                  expedients to maintain her position in society, have theirs. And not having any
                  noble principle of action to prompt me, or a single passage of Scripture to
                  sustain me under such self-imposed vexations, I should sink beneath them. Even the
                  anxieties and perplexities of those who, professing to have renounced the follies
                  and vanities of life, fluctuate and trim between Christ and the world, I conceive
                  to be far beyond my own. As to being settled Mr. Arthur has had very liberal
                  proposals, if he would forsake the itinerant ranks and become a settled pastor;
                  but so long as he can do more good as a traveling preacher he will not listen to
                  such proposals. And I should regret to see him seeking lease or emolument, while
                  there is so much to be done for the advancement of the Redeemer's kingdom on
                  earth."
               Mrs. Preedy changed color frequently, and soon arose to depart. She was
                  dissatisfied with herself, and tried in vain to pity the simplicity and
                  Christ-like spirit of a nature she could not comprehend; and Mrs. Arthur's heart
                  grew sad, that an immortal mind, created for a higher and a nobler life, should
                  have been so perverted by the dazzling show and false views of this life that it
                  could take delight in trifles, and waste its powers upon them.
               Toward the close of Mr. Arthur's fourth year in the city, his numerous friends
                  consulted each other on making him a pastoral visit. It was not the first time
                  they had done go, but as he was about to leave the city, they were resolved to compliment him in a pleasant way.
                  They provided their own entertainment, and then feasted several destitute families
                  on the fragments.
               Preacher and people entered heartily into the enjoyments of the occasion and the
                  evening passed off very pleasantly.
               After the company had all retired, the minister's family found something valuable
                  had been left for each one of them, though all agreed that "father had fared the
                  best," and, moreover that "he ought to, for he is the only minister
                  in the family."
               He received a beautiful set of silver forks, and an entire new suit, even to
                  gloves and cravat, besides several highly-prized volumes for his library just
                  issued. The books, he afterward learned, came from the young men who attended his
                  ministry.
               A merino dress of the finest quality, a valuable shawl, a new velvet bonnet, neat
                  and tasteful, besides various smaller articles, were found on Mrs. Arthur's
                  toilet, while the children were nearly frantic with their gifts, of less value,
                  indeed, but almost too numerous to mention, and declared to be "just what they
                  wanted;" and Nancy, her devotion to Mrs. Arthur was generally ally known and she
                  received, to her surprise, a new brown woolen shawl, which she smoothed down and
                  exhibited with great satisfaction; and no article that was left received so much
                  admiration and attention from each member of the household as Nancy's shawl.
               "We have had a charming time to-night, have we not?" said Mrs. Arthur to her
                  husband after the children had retired.
               "I think so," replied her husband. "We have a rich heritage in the affections of
                  God's children."
               "We certainly have," replied Mrs. Arthur. "Our perplexities may perhaps be
                  increased—though we are not sure of that—in becoming itinerants, but so are our
                  enjoyments. O, do you know where my velvet bonnet came from?"
               "No," replied Mr. Arthur.
               "Well, I do: it was from Mrs. Markham."
               "I am delighted to hear it," exclaimed Mr. Arthur. "It is best always to be gentle
                  and conciliating, is it not?"
               "Mrs. Markham evidently meant well, and she has shown a truly Christian spirit in
                  the affair," said Mrs. Arthur. "If she had taken offense, I should have been
                  inclined to doubt the purity of her motives."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           The hinds how blest, who ne'er beguiled
                           To quit their hamlet's hawthorn wild,
                           Nor haunt the crowd, nor tempt the main,
                           For splendid care, and guilty gain.
                        
                        
                           When morning's twilight-tinctured beam
                           Strikes their low thatch with slanting gleam,
                           They rove abroad in ether blue,
                           To dip the scythe in fragrant dew,
                           The sheaf to bind, the beech to fell,
                           That, nodding, shades a craggy dell.
                        
                     
                     —WARTON.
                  
               
               AT the next Conference Mr. Arthur received an appointment to a large inland town,
                  only about ten miles from the hamlet, were he had spent two of the pleasantest
                  years of his ministry.
               After the moving was over, and they had become quietly settled in their new
                  appointment, which they found a very pleasant one, the minister and his family
                  began to anticipate the pleasure of a visit to their friends at the hamlet, which
                  they had promised theme, should circumstances ever admit of it.
               While the subject was under dissension, they received a letter from Mrs. Hatfield,
                  inviting them to come and spend a week in his family, charging them playfully, but
                  explicitly, to leave "not a 'hoof' or a soul behind."
               The delight of the children at this announcement knew no bounds, and accordingly,
                  during their summer vacation, all departed for this much-desired visit.
               Marian Arthur was now a young lady in appearance, but she was a very child at
                  heart. The extreme simplicity and ingenuousness of her manners, her sweetness of
                  temper and overflowing vivacity, her qualities of mind, both brilliant and solid,
                  which already had become well developed, made her not only a general favorite, but
                  gave promise of superior usefulness. Even now the younger children appealed to her
                  as readily as to their mother, and she was not only their counselor, but also
                  their arbiter in all their little differences.
               Nathaniel, a magnanimous, energetic, intelligent boy, only a year his sister's
                  junior, more than ever like his father, was the moving spirit of the
                  household.
               That they had both recently become heirs of eternal life, and had transferred
                  their affections from earth's vanities
                  to the rich inheritance of their Father above, and were striving to live for
                  eternity, was a cause of deep thankfulness and joy to their heavenly-minded
                  parents.
               Next to them in the order of the household was the cherub-angel, separated from
                  them by the vail impenetrable, but ever reckoned as "one of us."
               Then there was Jennie and Frank, much alike, of lively and sensitive temperaments,
                  full of play, "quick to catch joy, and true to touch Of woe."
               Charlie was a sober, thoughtful child, of an inquiring mind, one who would from
                  his infancy study, and draw pleasure from a fly or a spider, a drop of water, or a
                  withered leaf. Young as he was, he seemed ever revolving some vast project in his
                  head, and on that account had received the weighty sobriquet of "deacon" from the
                  little "funsters," Frank and Jennie.
               The sweet little Addie, the darling of the household, seemed to partake of the
                  qualities of mind and of disposition of all the others. She had the peculiar
                  engaging sweetness of Marian, the quick intellect of Nathaniel, and the vivacity
                  and keen sensibilities of Frank and Jennie, with, the thoughtfulness of Charlie;
                  and the irresistible enchantment of her own charming, winning ways, made her the
                  pet of all, beloved and cherished with the tenderest affections
               It was a happy, joyous-hearted company—the father and mother seemed to have become
                  children with the rest—that left the parsonage that bright summer day, and arrived
                  at the hamlet toward its close; and a happy company had assembled at Farmer
                  Hatfield's to meet them.
               They were there again, the friends who had met a few years before to greet their
                  new pastor, then a stranger to them all. "Father" Harvey, with a countenance that
                  spoke of communion with the glorified, seemed just ready to take wing for a
                  brighter clime; and the magnanimous Boynton is the same cordial, intelligent,
                  good-humored man as of yore. The warm-hearted, noble-souled Hatfield, his refined
                  sensibilities and his genial nature have become more refined and more genial;
                  while his Maria, the sweet-tempered, dignified, motherly Mrs. Hatfield, with a
                  shade of unusual thoughtfulness upon her brow, is gliding about as usual,
                  dispensing happiness to all.
               William Lawrence is there too, spending his summer on Mr. Hatfield's farm, recruiting his
                  physical energies and his purse; and John Harwell, his "chum," has just arrived to
                  pass his vacation in labor with him.
               Dr. Richmond, the class-leader, is also present; and he seems much more at home at
                  Farmer Hatfield's than when Mr. Arthur first came to the hamlet. A slight blush on
                  Martha's cheek, when the doctor speaks, tells a story; and it is soon known to the
                  minister's family that they are just in time for a wedding; and when they learn
                  that the preacher stationed at the hamlet has been necessarily absent for several
                  weeks, and cannot soon return, they comprehend why Mr. Hatfield had professed a
                  preference for the visit at that time.
               Dr. Richmond is well known through all that region, and is noted for his exact
                  Christian deportment, his unswerving fidelity, and his active benevolence.
               Martha has a promising prospect before her: a pleasant home near her friends and
                  parents, and a companion of similar tastes and disposition, and a spirit in
                  harmony with her own. While the doctor thinks himself the happiest man in the
                  world, and that his Martha is the embodiment of mildness, wisdom, modesty, and
                  constancy stancy; and every one who knows her thinks the same.
               Dwight and Emmie, who are always the children at Farmer Hatfield's, and will,
                  doubtless, continue to be for a long time to come, are very busy here and there,
                  with sunny faces and joyous steps, seeking sources of amusement and gratification
                  for their young friends, as happy as innocence and a desire to impart happiness
                  can make them.
               The younger members of the family are not long in entering into the spirit of the
                  occasion, and Jennie and Frank come tripping in, hardly able to restrain their
                  glee, and whisper to their mother loud enough to be heard by every one in the
                  room, that they "are having the very best kind of a time."
               William Lawrence, who in his boyhood had the reputation of being as witty and
                  amusing personage as could be met with, shows unmistakable signs of an outburst of
                  his mirth-loving nature, while Harwell, who was never guilty of perpetrating a
                  joke in his life, looks on with the greatest apparent enjoyment.
               It was interesting to compare these two young men together; the brilliant powers
                  of the one, with the sober, ponderous, but attractive powers of the other. Lawrence would comprehend a subject
                  at once, while Harwell's mind seemed to pass from point to point, laboring slowly,
                  but unerringly, until the whole subject was grasped. The mind and conversation of
                  Lawrence were more "versatile, rapid, magnificent," while the words of Harwell
                  were weighty, and full of practical suggestiveness.
               The thoughts of Lawrence flowed from his lips with smoothness and eloquence.
                  Harwell found difficulty in expressing the commonest idea without hesitation.
                  Lawrence was impetuous, ardent, prompt; and would face and overcome difficulties,
                  while his friend was reconnoitering.
               When Harwell entered the Conference Academy, he was without money and without
                  friends, and though his pockets could never boast a well-filled purse, he had, by
                  his extraordinary candor and pious simplicity, obtained an honorable distinction
                  in his own circle, though he was scarcely known beyond it.
               His connection with Lawrence, whose kindly nature overflowed with love and
                  good-will to all, was most fortunate. He brought Harwell out, called into exercise
                  a distinct order of his faculties, and new sources of enjoyment and usefulness
                  were opened to him.
               Before his acquaintance with Lawrence, he had lived almost like a recluse; now all
                  the social feelings of his nature, which had so long been lying dormant, were
                  awakened to hew life. Of delicate and refined sensibilities, he had shrunk from
                  the unfeeling gaze of thoughtlessness that never knew, nor could appreciate, the
                  nobleness and depth of nature that dwelt under that shabby exterior.
               Lawrence knew (for Harwell had made him, and him alone, his confidant) that a
                  beloved and honored mother, all the relative he had in the world, was dependent on
                  him for support. Cheered and sustained by her prayers, and by the benediction, of
                  a dying father, he had never wavered, but had pressed on in his manly course, and
                  mountains had become plains before his indomitable perseverance.
               Then Lawrence knew the secret of the scanty wardrobe, the dinners of mush and of
                  corn-cakes, and why every Saturday night for months he had "inked the seams of his
                  only coat," and had kept it together only by constant attention.
               It was a happy day for Harwell when Lawrence arrived at the Academy. They were a
                  mutual help to each other, and it would be difficult cult to tell which was the most benefited,
                  Lawrence's keen eye had detected the difference between his own present supplies
                  and his room-mate's, and after gaining his confidence he had said, "All things in
                  common, Harwell, or I must go;" and the other, assured of the noblest intentions
                  on the part of his chum, and conscious of the absence of selfish motives on his
                  own part, acquiesced in the arrangement. But this circumstance is worth the naming
                  only as it shows traits of character equally honorable to both.
               An evening of unalloyed happiness was spent at Farmer Hatfield's, such as the
                  affected great, or those who are unacquainted with the joys of communion with the
                  source of all happiness, could neither appreciate nor enjoy.
               The company were scattered. The children, beneath the orchard-trees and through
                  the clover meadows, near the house, had spent the evening together in unrestrained
                  mirth.
               The young people had been enticed further by the cool, refreshing summer breezes,
                  and the fragrant fields. The majestic cliffs looked still more majestic in the
                  soft moonlight, and seemed to be looking down upon, and guarding with parental
                  care, the valleys slumbering at their feet. These had allured them even
                  to their summits; and then the varied landscape was spread out in all its gorgeous
                  beauty before them.
               This was a night never forgotten by that youthful band. Purposes high and holy
                  were strengthened, new hopes were awakened, and chords were touched in those young
                  hearts that vibrated in unison until they ceased to beat.
               The elder part of the company remained at home, and spent the evening in
                  conversation edifying and entertaining.
               At ten o'clock all reassembled in Mr. Hatfield's parlor, to spend an hour in prayer and exhortation.
                  And "gradually, as one after another still fervently prayed together, their souls
                  began to sympathize, the one with the other, blending in one common religious
                  feeling." Soon after they separated to meet again on the morrow.

                           "When heart embraces heart,
                           Encircled in their heavenly Father's love,
                           His all-benignant eye is seen above,
                           Confirming what is done."
                        
                        
                           The good old man has gone!
                           He lies in his saintly rest;
                           And his labors all are done,
                           And the work he loved the best:
                           The good old man is gone,
                           But the dead in the Lord is bless'd.
                        
                     
                     —DOANE.
                  
               
               THE next day the wedding party assembled, and the table was spread on a warm turfy
                  bank, near the river's brink, beneath the spreading oaks.
               The residents of the hamlet were invited; and here the marriage ceremony was
                  performed by Mr. Arthur. Music, at intervals, enlivened the afternoon; and when at
                  length its last echoes, reverberating from cliff to cliff, died away in the
                  distance, the villagers dispersed. "Father" Harvey and a few others still
                  lingered, as if unwilling to break the enchantment that held them spell-bound to
                  the spot.
               
               The bride and bridegroom, with characteristic forgetfulness of self, had made many
                  a heart happy that day by cheerful attentions and pleasant words, and their
                  beaming eyes and repose of features told of a bliss nestling at their own hearts
                  too deep for utterance.
               Mr. Arthur who had wandered a short distance from the company, now drew near, and
                  every eye turned to welcome him. He was a man greatly and deservedly beloved. He
                  had the finest sympathies for humanity, and could see even in the most degraded
                  some redeeming quality, and the hope never failed him that a spark of celestial
                  light would penetrate the darkness, and being fanned by divine influence, would
                  lead them to purity, to heaven.
               He knew well that the harsh word and the upbraiding look never softened the heart.
                  His pleasant, open smile, and encouraging tone and manner assured all that, though
                  his pure spirit could never approve the wrong, yet in him they had not the
                  censorious judge, but the loving and compassionate friend.
               He strove to make the err sensible; of their faults, and then allured them to a
                  higher standard of conduct, by showing them the deep heinousness of sin, and the
                  beauty of holiness.
               Lawrence soon after approached with a countenance beaming with rapture, and
                  reclining easily upon the bank, he seemed lost to everything around him. Every one
                  wished to speak, but all loved him too well to interrupt his deep
                  spirit-communings.
               His clear, fall eye took in at a single glance the beauty of the scene; the deep
                  stream slowly  winding away in the distance, bordered by the
                  weeping-willows and the long meadow grass, the fields of bright waving grain beyond; and
                  further still the rising woodland covered with dense pine, whose sighing branches,
                  constant in grief, murmured a soothing requiem for earth's dead, and still beyond
                  and over all the clear blue expanse of heaven. Here his eye rested, and now all
                  knew whence came their ethereal light. And then he murmured in a low, clear voice: 
                     
                        "'I thirst for a life-giving God,
                        A God that on Calvary died;
                        A fountain of water and blood,
                        That gush'd from Emanuel's side!
                     
                     
                        "'I gasp for the stream of thy love,
                        The spirit of rapture unknown;
                        And then to redrink it above,
                        Eternally fresh from thy throne.'"
                     
                  
               
               The bird-like voice and merry laugh of Addie were now heard, as she came tripping
                  over the green grass, leaving the good Nancy quite out of sight. She had a large
                  bunch of lilies in her hand, which she had gathered for the company.
               "I can give you one, Grandpapa Harvey," she began, "and Auntie Martha, and Brother
                  Richmond, and Cousin Dwight, poor child;" and she reached up to imprint a kiss
                  upon his glowing cheek. Dwight laughed at this epithet of endearment, and all the
                  children laughed with him.
               Each one shared in her treasures, and Mr. Hatfield last of all. The company were
                  surprised at this, but soon saw the policy of the little girl.
               She cast an inquiring glance upon him, his eye met hers, its love-light welcomed
                  her, and in a moment she was in his arms; now running her little velvet hands
                  through his glossy brown hair, and now insisting on placing one of her lilies over
                  each of his ears.
               Where did you get your curls, Addie?" said Mr. Hatfield to the little girl,
                  playfully.
               With a look subdued in a moment into reverence, and a face radiant with confiding
                  love and innocence, as if an angel breathed upon it, she replied:
               "God gave them to me. Don't you know God, Brother Hatfield?"
               The good farmer pressed the little lamb close to his heart, and could not for a
                  moment reply. A tear glistened in his eye as he thought of the incomprehensible
                  and the infinitely holy nature of the great Creator, and of his own unlikeness to
                  him.
               
               Addie looked up into his face for an answer.
               "I know him as my Father, Addie, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,"
                  replied Mr. Hatfield, with simplicity and deep feeling; "and I am glad my little
                  friend remembers who gives her all the blessings she enjoys. Can you tell me who
                  made all things, Addie?"
               "God made everything," replied the little girl, sweetly.
               "But did God make your apron?" inquired Mr. Hatfield.
               "O no, Brother Hatfield! my mamma made my apron, and dress, and stockings; but I
                  think God made the cloth," replied the little reasoner.
               Mr. Hatfield talked on with the little girl for some time.
               The sun had already sent his good-night kiss to each cheek upon his last beams,
                  and had whispered hopefully in each heart, "I shall see you to-morrow."
               "Father" Harvey now leaned back in his chair to reach his favorite staff, which he
                  had carefully hung by its crook on a low branch of the oak under which they were
                  sitting, and Addie was polishing the head of Mr. Hatfield's cane. Nancy showed
                  unmistakable signs of uneasiness lest her little pet should be exposed to the
                  falling dews; the young people and the children had returned from their rambles;
                  and all began to make preparations to depart, though none seemed willing to
                  leave.
               Mary Hatfield, with a soul full of poetry, though she had never written a stanza
                  in her life, caught the inspiration of the hour, and her beautiful features glowed
                  with enthusiasm and devotion.
               She whispered to her father, "Can we not have family prayers here?"
               "Yes, my dear," replied the farmer; and he turned to Mr. Arthur.
               "This is a proper place for prayer," said the minister; "and though we cannot look
                  through nature up to nature's God without the aid of Divine revelation, yet with
                  that aid we can see God in all his works."
               "The groves were God's first temples," replied Mr. Hatfield and to me there is no
                  place more appropriate for worship. Can we not sing a hymn?"
               All looked at Lawrence and Harwell; and they commenced in full, heavy voices,
                  "Father" Harvey's favorite words:
                  
                     
                        "Forever with the Lord!
                        Amen, so let it be!
                        Life from the dead is in that word,
                        'Tis immortality.
                     
                     
                        "Here in the body pent,
                        Absent from thee I roam;
                        Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
                        A day's march nearer home.
                     
                     
                        "Forever with the Lord!
                        Father, if 'tis thy will,
                        The promise of that faithful word,
                        E'en here in me fulfill.
                     
                     
                        "So when my latest breath,
                        Shall rend the vail in twain,
                        By death I shall escape from death,
                        And life eternal gain.
                     
                     
                        "Knowing as I am known,
                        How shall I love that word,
                        And oft repeat before the throne,
                        Forever with the Lord!"
                     
                  
               
               Marian and Nathaniel Arthur accompanying in a fine alto, and Mary Hatfield in a
                  clear and sweet treble, all hearts were borne away with the music and the
                  sentiments of the inimitable hymn.
               Every spirit seemed subdued as in the presence of Infinity. To "Father" Harvey the
                  vail was already rent in twain and he had a glimpse of the unseen glory. He saw
                  his moving tent pitched on the other shore, and the sight ravished his spirit.
               Mr. Arthur prayed ardently, and in the spirit of devotion. As he closed, "Father"
                  Harvey clasped his hands with fervor, and with eyes upraised and tearful, and
                  blanched face and quivering lip, as if in the immediate presence of Deity, he
                  repeated in a low, deep tone: "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy
                  name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
                  day our dayly bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead
                  us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the
                  power, and the glory forever. Amen."
               "Amen!" responded all audibly. Never before had the prayer of our Lord seemed to
                  them so full of meaning, deep, unutterable meaning. It was enough. All now wended
                  their way homeward.
               "Father" Harvey's heart overflowed with rapturous joy, and all accompanied him to
                  his cottage home. "My course is nearly finished," said he; "I shall soon be free
                  from temptation, free from sin, Halleluiah! my soul melts under Divine influence. Deposit this body by the side of
                  my dear sainted Polly's, my brethren. When I put on the robe of immortality I
                  should like to try my infant wings there, and raise my first shout over vanquished
                  death and hell there."
               He passed into his cottage, where his kind son-in-law and affectionate daughter
                  awaited him.
               William Lawrence intended to return with the company, but turned again and entered
                  the cottage, to pass the night with "Father" Harvey. A spirit seemed to whisper in
                  his heart, "Knowest thou not that the Lord will take away thy "father" from thy
                  head to-day?"
               The venerable man, before retiring to rest, walked up and down the room, singing, 
                     
                        "Press, forward, press forward, the prize is in view,
                        A crown of bright glory is waiting for you."
                     
                  
               
               "I am going home, William," he exclaimed, soon after, as he leaned back in a large
                  arm chair. "Hark! I hear that voice to-night which I heard fifty years ago under
                  the old elm-tree, and it calls me away; then it spoke my sins forgiven, now it
                  calls me away. Hark! do you not hear it? Call my children."
               They were there in an instant, and a few moments ments after, while his mortal
                  frame rested in the strong embrace of the weeping Lawrence, and the drooping head
                  fell back upon the shoulder of the young man, the humble, holy, and useful servant
                  of his Lord reached forth his hand and ejaculated, "It is mine." The glittering
                  crown appeared in full view.
               "Now I see, I see clearly," he exclaimed soon after; and his pure spirit, freed
                  from its prison-house, departed with the word.
               He had been singing of heaven, and the rapturous notes were still vibrating in his
                  soul. Then all was hushed, and in a moment he was ravished with the music of the
                  skies. 
                     
                        "From the chair to the throne! O vision sublime!
                        All the beauties celestial combining;
                        Like the rising of morn o'er the darkness of time,
                        The radiance of heaven was shining.
                     
                     
                     
                        "The sweet music of angels enraptured his soul,
                        And his giant heart leaped with emotion;
                        When his sanctified spirit, intent on the goal,
                        Launch'd forth on eternity's ocean."
                     
                  
               
               Quickly the sad news spread, not only through the hamlet, but for many miles
                  around. Father Harvey is dead," fell mournfully upon many hearts. The funeral was
                  numerously attended, and groups here
                  and there sorrowfully discussed the merits of the deceased.
               Weeping friends bore his body to the church in which he had been so long a
                  constant worshiper, and placed the coffin near the altar, where be had so often
                  commemorated the death of the Saviour whose praises he was now celebrating with
                  the glorified.
               Mr. Arthur preached a funeral discourse to a sobbing multitude.
               As they wended their way to the quiet graveyard, they halted beneath the old
                  elm-tree, at the foot of which, so many years before, he had claimed a risen
                  Saviour; and, agreeably to his oft-repeated request, they sung a hymn of
                  triumphant victory. They then passed on to the sacred enclosure.
               "I am the resurrection and the life," repeated the clergyman, in clear, full
                  tones, as they entered the resting-place of the departed. "He that believeth in
                  me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in
                  me shall never die." "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at
                  the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body,
                  yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall
                  behold, and not another." "We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain
                  we can take nothing out." The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be
                  the name of the Lord." "I heard a voice saying unto me, Write: from henceforth
                  blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; even so, saith the Spirit, for they rest
                  from their labors." Then a few words of prayer followed, and they left him there
                  to sleep.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               
                  
                     
                        Give me the mind that, bent on highest aim,
                        Deems virtue's rugged path sole path to fame;
                        Great things with small compare in scale sublime,
                        And life with death, eternity with time."
                     
                  
               
               AUTUMN found Lawrence and Harwell again at the academy, devoted to the pursuit of
                  knowledge and to mental discipline, with characteristic enthusiasm. They were
                  earnestly looking forward to the day that should transfer them to stations of more
                  extended usefulness.
               Life presented to their ardent imagination an inviting picture. Shades might be
                  indicated—deep shades; but these were only the finishing touches of a skillful
                  hand, that mellowed its brightness, and rendered the effect more charming.
               To their strong, hopeful hearts success seemed certain. Success! To these
                  Christian young men, that was not success which might bear them gently along to
                  the goal of wealth and luxurious indulgence. That was not success which might
                  place them highest on the roll of fame, and bring adoring multitudes to their
                  feet; that was not success that might win them a name that might live centuries
                  after they were dead.
               No; if they could say, when life's scroll was about to be rolled up, and borne
                  away to the archives of eternity, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
                  course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
                  righteousness," that would be success.
               To such success they aspired. Centuries on centuries would add to their fame.
                  "Glory, honor, immortality, eternal life;" was that not enough?
               To one unacquainted with the high and holy purposes that inspired these young men,
                  their pent quarters would have been a prison, and their coarse food like the
                  meager supply doled out by the warden; but when such thoughts burned within their
                  hearts, their little naked room was a palace, and their homely fare angels'
                  food.
               To do good was the controlling, absorbing principle by which they were actuated;
                  and who will say that a pious young man intent on this great object cannot do as
                  much, while a humble student of an
                  academy, or of a higher institution of learning, as in any other position in
                  life?
               Who can say, limited though his sphere may be, that his consistent course, his
                  personal appeals to the hearts of his fellow-students, his unconscious influence
                  over them, may not produce greater results than years of his future ministry?
               A young man of high moral and religious principles, of deep, consistent piety, and
                  of commanding talents, who remains two or three years at an institution of
                  learning, can there exert an influence over his young associates equal, and
                  sometimes superior, to the instructors themselves.
               Here, then, is an opportunity for usefulness overlooked and passed by, though it
                  may be by those who are intent only on great achievements in the future, which
                  promises not; only a present harvest, but fruits that shall be gathered into the
                  garner of the Lord from all lands.
               Rev. Mr. Emerson,, the principal, was in the habit of addressing his school at
                  their weekly prayer-meetings.
               "My young friends," said he, on one occasion, "you are here preparing yourselves
                  for future usefulness, and your hearts are full of hope; but you will not all
                  attain to eminence. Let a retrospective view finite the beginning of time with the
                  present. Only a few names of all who have ever lived shine out amid the darkness,
                  A nation that produced a Solon, must have had galaxy of lesser lights; but where
                  are they a gloom impenetrable hangs over them.
               "You desire to be useful in life; but have you those graces of the Spirit that
                  will insure success? The little one can do, seems hardly worth the doing; but when
                  we connect the events of Time with the realities of Eternity, each act assumes the
                  weight of an infinite importance. When you retire from these associations, many of
                  you to your homes, will you be willing to knock at the door of some obscure
                  Sabbath school, and ask for the privilege of telling the story of the cross to a
                  few little ones you may collect around you? for many of you will have a field of
                  labor no more extended than this; and have you those graces of the Spirit that
                  will make you faithful there?
               "And you, my young brethren in the ministry, on leaving this place, you will give
                  yourselves to the Church. Will you be satisfied should you be sent to some
                  distant, barren, and uncultivated region, where your talents may be unappreciated, your allowance scanty, and yourself
                  neglected? Will you then murmur, and think yourselves hardly dealt by and
                  oppressed? Will such thoughts as these arise in your hearts: To what use have I
                  been studying, and toiling, and spending my time and my substance, if such is my
                  reward? If so, you need more of the mind that was in Christ; and I pray you strive
                  to attain to a higher standard of Christian experience. You will find many falling
                  below your reasonable expectations. But do not frown upon them, and make
                  yourselves unhappy on that account. If everybody acted right, there would be no
                  need of your labors for their improvement.
               "The idea of a bargain between yourselves and a Church, that you will serve up to
                  them the precious and glorious truths of the Gospel for a stipulated sum, is not
                  quite worthy the dignity of a true Gospel minister, and the great work in which he
                  is engaged. On the other hand, a Church—and most of those who hear me will soon be
                  members of Churches in different places,—that in a niggardly manner doles out a
                  scanty allowance to their minister, shows too plainly that they have not imbibed
                  deeply the true spirit of the Gospel. Never lose sight of the fact, that you are
                     all missionaries, both the ministry and the laity, and that your
                  object is the evangelization of the world. Leave it to Providence to direct your
                  course; and however humble your station may be, you will be happy, and prepared
                  for usefulness in it."
               This was the spirit these young men earnestly cultivated. A spirit of unholy
                  ambition; a thirst for preëminence, for its own sake, they guarded against as a
                  deadly foe.
               "You hard the remarks of our principal last evening, I suppose," said Safford, a
                  fellow- student, to our young friends, as he rejoined them in a morning walk.
               "Now for a chafing," thought Harwell; and he shrugged his shoulders, and then
                  nerved himself to patient endurance.
               "We were both at the meeting," was the brief response.
               "And what did you think of the remarks of our principal?" persisted Safford.
               "I thought he talked like a Christian hero," replied Lawrence, with emphasis.
               "Well, I thought he did not know much about it," replied Safford, with
                  self-complacency; "with all due deference to Mr. Emerson, though. But let him go
                  into the itinerant erant work as the
                  rest of us have, and fare as we do; and then he would know something by
                  experience. I have been in the regular work myself you know."
               "This Mr. Emerson did do in his early ministry," replied Harwell.
               "We," continued Safford, as if he were the speaker of the itinerant army; "we
                  leave our all—houses and lands, and parents, and brothers, and sisters, and
                  friends—for Christ's sake and the Gospel's, and consent to have no permanent home
                  on earth; but give our lifetime to toil, and suffering, and self-sacrificing
                  labors, and patiently endure self-denials, and privations, and consent to become
                  nothing but poor Methodist preachers, that we may—"
               "And pray, Safford, what was your occupation and prospects, from which you made
                  such a humiliating descent to became nothing but a 'poor Methodist minister?' sung
                  out Harwell.
               Harwell fixed his full black eye upon him, and Safford felt the majesty of soul
                  that look indicated.
               "I had a good trade," replied Safford; "and should, probably, have been at the
                  head of a large manufactory, accumulating wealth, and giving at my ease, if I had
                  not entered the ministry".
               "A good trade," said Lawrence, in a good-natured, and candid manner, "is certainly
                  one step toward affluence. You might possibly have succeeded, or the chance might
                  have been that you would never have got beyond the awl and the bench. Where one
                  succeeds, hundreds fail. The bare possibility that you might become rich, is set
                  off against the possibility that you might die in the almshouse; and many
                  probabilities that you would always have been a poor, hard-working man."
               "It seems to me," said Harwell, "that if you view the matter in a temporal light,
                  you have improved your condition. You are now received into the best society, and
                  treated like a gentleman. This would not by many be considered a poor exchange for
                  the work-bench. Now, if your health fails you in the ministry, you will have an
                  allowance from the Church funds, and when superannuated, an annuity. A small one,
                  it may be, and will ever be considered, for a man who, has spent a lifetime in the
                  services of the Church; but a very generous one to the individual who enters the
                  ministry with ordinary talents and preparation, and spends at most but a few years in it, for which he
                  may have been fully compensated. But do not understand me to say," continued
                  Harwell, "that the ministry have not and do not make many sacrifices. It is to
                  their zeal and self-denying labors, and to the efficiency of the itinerancy, that
                  the Church of which we are members owes its signal success, while the great body
                  of the people have been strangers to the true missionary spirit. The zeal, and
                  prayers, and sympathies, and gifts of the Church have been disproportionate to
                  that of the ministry."
               "Let me tell you, Safford," said Lawrence, "it will not look well, in you or me to
                  be whining about the sacrifices we have made in becoming ministers. I have left my
                  plow and my sickle; you have done more. You have left your all, he
                  added, looking quizzically at Safford, "as well as your lap-stone and hammer. Why,
                  Safford," continued he, with the greatest good-nature and frankness, "one would
                  think, to hear your bleating, that the whole itinerant flock had been fleeced, and
                  turned out to feed upon barren rocks, and were starving and freezing beneath the
                  pelting of a March northeaster. We talk about the sacrifices and the self-denials.
                  we endure In preparing for the ministry, as though that would be imputed to us for
                  righteousness," continued Lawrence; "but there are many among us who would do the
                  same for the love we have for the pursuits of literature, though I trust many are
                  actuated by the higher and holier motives of religion."
               "It is well for us to look these things in the face," said Harwell. "We wrap
                  ourselves in the mantle of self-complacency, and imagine we are doing many things
                  for the glory of God, when self is at the bottom of it. Let us see to it that our
                  works shall endure the fire."
               Safford left them sooner than they had anticipated. That he was a wiser or a
                  better man is uncertain.

                     —REV. D. TRUMAN.
                  
               
               "AT the time when kings go forth to battle," the itinerant army were marshaling
                  anew, and preparing for a fresh campaign.
               "The cabinet," consisting of the bishop and presiding elders, untrammeled now by
                  official dignity, but trammeled by the pressure of claims they could hardly meet,
                  were discussing the wants of their stations, and the qualifications of their men,
                  in conclave.
               One of them, a portly, serene-looking personage, with an expansive brow and
                  venerable appearance, held a list of names in his hand; and he passed his finger
                  down the list, and rested it upon Mr. Arthur's.
               "I must have that man," said he to his clerical brother at his right.
               "What! Arthur?" said his friend, starting. "I cannot spare him." And he shook his
                  head decidedly.
               "I cannot do without him," replied the first; "must have him."
               "It will hardly do to remove him," replied Mr. Arthur's presiding elder. "His
                  Church will feel aggrieved. They are very much attached to him."
               "No doubt of it," replied the first; "but he is the very man for my largest
                  appointment in the city. I do not know another man who is so well fitted for it.
                  The circumstances of that Church are peculiar. They have reached a crisis, and no
                  one can guide them through it so well as Brother Arthur. The society where he is
                  can do without him. They are strong; an army in themselves; at peace, and free
                  from embarrassments. A deeply pious man, with fine pulpit talents, will do as well
                  for them as one who has the superior tact in managing difficulties that Brother
                  Arthur possesses, in addition to those qualifications."
               The discussion was not continued long before it was conceded that Mr. Arthur must
                  be removed; and after consulting him, the matter was fixed and passed into a
                  "decree."
               
               His society felt disappointed but the hearts of their official men were too true
                  to the general interests of the Church, of which they formed but a small part, and
                  their missionary zeal was too warm, to indulge in dissatisfaction or
                  complaint.
               The Conference had provided for them a preacher they might not like so well as
                  they did Mr. Arthur; but, perhaps, many would like him better, and they concluded
                  wisely that they had no right, as official members of the Church, to please
                  themselves always at the expense of others.
               Mr. Arthur left with their blessings, and Mr. Potter, his successor, received a
                  cordial welcome.
               Mr. and Mrs. Arthur found the provision for them in their new city home, nearly
                  what they would have wished. Almost everything had been done that could be done to
                  make it pleasant.
               "When this spirit pervades our Churches generally, our opportunities for
                  usefulness will be greatly increased," said Mr. Arthur. "We have sometimes spent a
                  month or more in getting settled. If our smaller stations knew what was for their
                  interest, they would be more prompt in this matter, and have the minister's home
                  ready for him. We can enter upon our work now without delay."
               "Yes," replied his wife cheerfully, "and this gives us time to think and act for
                  others, and for the future. Am I unthankful? I have been thinking of our children,
                  though I do not allow myself to feel anxious about them. But I do wish their
                  opportunities for improvement were better. Nathaniel ought to enter on his course
                  preparatory to entering college."
               "I know it, my dear," replied Mr. Arthur; "I cannot avoid a feeling of
                  responsibility even beyond what I can do for them, in my present
                  circumstances."
               "While others are amassing wealth for their children," said Mrs. Arthur, "we can
                  leave ours nothing, and we certainly ought to give them an education. This we owe
                  them. Not alone that they may make their way in life; this is of secondary
                  consideration, the lowest in the scale, and yet it should not be disregarded."
               "We ought, Mary," replied Mr. Arthur, "to aim to prepare them for usefulness. How
                  much there is to be done. When we pray the Lord of the harvest to send forth more
                  laborers into his harvest, we ought also to do all we can to prepare laborers for the work. Our children have
                  been committed to our care as sacred trusts by our heavenly Father, and their
                  religious and mental culture is binding upon us. I should not think it right to
                  neglect them, even for the work of the Gospel ministry. My firm conviction that I
                  am in the path of duty, and that God will not require of me more than I am able to
                  perform and my faith, grounded upon these convictions, that the means will be
                  provided for them, has alone sustained me.
               "Marian, and Nathaniel especially, ought to have better advantages than they now
                  possess for mental improvement," said Mrs. Arthur. "We have endeavored to instill
                  into their minds a theory of life consistent with their relations to eternity, and
                  I think they have an earnest, comprehensive view of the great object of their
                  existence. They already manifest a good degree of zeal for the glory of God and
                  the good of their fellow-beings, and I think their aims high. Marian was asking me
                  to-day if I did not think she might get a situation as assistant teacher. She
                  thought she might be doing a little good in that way, and she would save her
                  salary to pay her expenses at school."
               A tear sparkled in the eye of the single-hearted minister; a tear not the result,
                  of parental pride alone, though the noble impulses of his lovely daughter caused
                  his bosom to dilate with gratitude, and he felt to his heart's center a thrill, of
                  emotion.
               Wealth now looked desirable, not for its own sake, but that he might give this
                  beloved child qualifications for the higher and nobler walks of life.
               He did not wish for an artificial refinement or dazzling accomplishments, that she
                  might move in halls of splendor, or shine in the mockeries of fashionable circles.
                  No. He desired to fit her for a purer and more elevated destiny. He wished to
                  bestow upon her a religious and intellectual training, that should give
                  enlargement, elevation, and refinement to the mind, and qualify her for those
                  positions in life, where the strongest and most enduring moral influences could be
                  exerted.
               They had instructed their children in evangelical doctrines, had exercised over
                  them a godly discipline, and their fervent piety called forth from the hearts of
                  the parents deep gratitude; and they wished them to be jewels polished for their
                  Master's service.
               
               The great end of life would be but partially attained, should their children be
                  fitted only to maintain their present position respectably. They ought to be
                  prepared to influence mind and mold character. They wished them also to be
                  strongly fortified, by intelligence and deep piety, for the conflict of life, that
                  they might maintain their ground against vice and error, and, escaping its snares
                  themselves, act a praise-worthy part in promoting the great interests of society.
                  They believed Christianity to have a power to develop and ennoble the whole
                  character of man, and that it is the Christian's sacred duty thus to develop and
                  ennoble it. They considered that neither one's faculties nor their sphere of
                  operations are his own, but that he must subdue and cultivate the garden of his
                  soul for God.
               Mr. Arthur's views were comprehensive. He saw the wants of the Church, and its
                  resources in the young. He believed that, preparatory to the good time coming, the
                  ministry and the membership must advance both in piety and intelligence.
               "The Church of Christ, said he, "must have a stronger faith, and more
                  comprehensive views of the great object of life; more knowledge, more holiness and
                  then may we hope to realize such success in the subjection of the world to Christ
                  as shall usher in the millennial dawn."
               "Nathaniel is not less enthusiastic than his sister," continued Mrs. Arthur "to
                  enter upon a more thorough preparation for usefulness. He is still resolved to be
                  a minister."
               "I know it," replied Mr. Arthur. "Nattie never wavered in that resolution but
                  once. You recollect when the conviction was pressed home upon him that he was not
                  good enough, and did not know enough to be a minister."
               Mr. Arthur smiled; so did his wife.
               It seemed to them but a day since Nathaniel was their only son—a bright,
                  rosy-cheeked, curly-headed boy—learning his alphabet at his mother's knee. Now his
                  plans for life were laid broad and noble, unfavorable alike to ambition, sloth,
                  and selfishness.
               "What can we do?" said Mr. Arthur; and he arose and paced the floor as if his
                  whole soul was in agitation. "What can we do? Let us ask, Mary, more earnestly
                  than ever, the direction of Heaven."
               With a single eye to the glory of God, and the good of their fellow-beings, the
                  minister a his wife had full confidence to present their cause to the consideration of the Governor of
                  the universe.
               Reminded of the promise, "No good thing will he withhold from them that walk
                  uprightly," their first steps were to prove their claims to it. This proved
                  satisfactorily to their own minds, they asked themselves if what they desired was
                  for their own selfish ends, or that good might be done, and God's name glorified.
                  These points settled, they committed their ways to their heavenly Father, in the
                  assurance that his goodness and wisdom are infinite.

                           Where are they now, those little ones,
                           The dying preacher bless'd?
                           Sweet flowers that bloom'd like olive plants,
                           By love's own hand caress'd.
                           No wealth was his, though great and good,
                           But moral worth sublime
                           Won homage from ten thousand hearts;
                           But he fell in manhood's prime.
                        
                        
                           And fortune's star has strangely beam'd
                           On that forsaken band,
                           Upon whose head there rested once
                           A dying father's hand.
                        
                     
                     —REV. L. B. GURLEY.
                  
               
               A FEW days after, Mrs. Arthur received a letter from Mrs. Barton, full of
                  gratitude and of hope.
               Her sons—so she wrote—were growing up all a mother's heart could wish, and had
                  already given evidence of sincere piety.
               Gustavus and Henry were resolved to be ministers, like their father, and were
                  preparing for college. Edward, the eldest, a frank, active, generous boy, wanted
                  to enter into business. He would make a
                  home for his mother; and there was Stave and Harry, they would be worn-out
                  preachers some day," and he would "have a house large enough for them too; and if
                  they had any boys of their own, they should all go through college, for their
                  Uncle Ned would be rich:" that was Edward's plan.
               Mrs. Barton wished Arthur's assistance in procuring Edward a situation, and a
                  suitable home in the city.
               After making extensive inquiries, Mr. Arthur succeeded in obtaining a place for
                  Edward in a large publishing house. As it was desirable for him to become
                  acquainted with all the details of the business, it was arranged that he should
                  serve a regular apprenticeship, and he had the promise of promotion as rapidly as
                  his talents and faithfulness would entitle him to it.
               His employers were magnanimous men, noted for their energy and philanthropy as
                  well as for integrity and firm religious principles.
               Their provisions for Edward were generous, and his prospects were good.
               His advancement would be slow, but if he retained those principles. of moral
                  purity and integrity that had been instilled into his mind with, so much care by
                  his godly mother, it promised ultimate success.
               But a home for a boy so young in a large city was more difficult to
                  obtain. After several fruitless efforts on the part of Mr. Arthur, the thought
                  occurred to him to take Edward into his own family, and he proposed it to Mrs.
                  Arthur.
               "Why did we not think of this before?" said the minister's wife. "It will subject
                  us to some inconveniences, I know; but these dwindle after we become accustomed to
                  them. But we must take Edward," continued she; "indeed, we ought to do it. It
                  would not be right to leave him exposed to the temptations of a city life without
                  a father or a mother's watch-care. His father, upon his deathbed, left his
                  children in the care of his heavenly Master's servants, and we will try and, do
                  all we can for their good."
               Happy were the hearts of the minister and his wife, that they could act the part
                  of parents toward the orphan son of a deceased brother minister.
               Mrs. Barton was pleased with the arrangement, and especially that her darling
                     Edward was to be one of Mr. Arthur's
                  family; and the first-born went forth from the widow's home with a manly heart and
                  a firm purpose.
               In all his plans for the future, his mother figured most prominently. He had never
                  forgotten her slow step and her disconsolate look—so unlike his mother—when
                  strangers bore away his beloved father to the grave. Then he had resolved to be
                  her protector, and then he had prayed that his limbs might grow large and strong,
                  and that God would take care of him that he might take care of his mother.
               The assistance of others had been accepted, but it had been his life's dream to
                  provide for her himself. Now he hoped to realize, before many years, its
                  accomplishment. Urged on by this inspiring motive, Edward was happy in his new
                  relations.
               He had been at Mr. Arthur's scarcely a week before he felt quite at home, and
                  Marian and Nathaniel enjoyed his company much.
               "The boys have a capital plan to propose to you," said Marian to her father.
                  "Sister Barton can take our Nattie in Edward's place, and he can go to the Academy
                  and prepare for college right off."
               "Well done! that is capital," replied Mr. Arthur; "and I am not sure but we may do
                  it. I am almost surprised that we had not thought of it ourselves."
               "We should have thought of it if we had been thinking of nothing else, like
                  Nattie," replied the mother.
               "I think we can make it out, Mary," said Mr. Arthur, after musing for a short
                  time.
               "And if we were sure of remaining in the city so long, and Edward should stay
                  here, Nattie might go to college with Gustavus and Henry, for Sister Barton is
                  going to remove with them, and then he could keep right on through his course
                  without stopping," said the hoping, generous Marian.
               "Perhaps they will make a presiding elder of you, father," continued she, her face
                  glowing with pleasure on account of her brother's opening prospects. "If they do,
                  you can remain here long enough."
               "You are your mother's girl, Marian," said Mr. Arthur, affectionately, as he gazed
                  with a father's tenderness upon the beaming features of the enthusiastic girl.
               "And father's too," replied Marian, as she slipped her arm caressingly about his
                  neck, and looked up into the face of
                  her father, whom she little less than worshiped.
               Then she skipped away with a light heart and step to seek her brother, and to tell
                  him of their deliberations.
               "I think we may contrive to send Marian too; at least for six months," remarked
                  Mr. Arthur.
               "O, I wish we could; she desires it so much," replied Mrs. Arthur.
               "We may possibly bring it about; I will see," replied the minister.
               And they did bring it about, and a few weeks after Marian and Nathaniel, to their
                  great joy, were on their way to the Academy.
               Mrs. Barton proved a mother to them, and when Marian's six months had expired,
                  which she had endeavored to improve faithfully, she wrote to Mr. Arthur that she
                  wished to keep Marian another six months at her own expense; reminding him, at the
                  same time, of the pecuniary aid he had afforded her in the hour of her need.
               "You told me," she wrote to Mr. Arthur, "that your plan of proportionate giving
                  had furnished you with a certain sum for the Lord's cause, and that you considered
                  the relief of the widows and orphans of your deceased brother ministers eminently
                  the Lord's cause. I have adopted your plan, and it has left at my disposal the sum
                  I have named to you, and I know not how I can bestow a part of it more religiously
                  than by helping on a noble and a pure heart, and a lofty intellect in its
                  struggles and yearnings to expand itself to its full power, and in its preparation
                  for usefulness and success in all good.
               "Ought I rather to appropriate it to the missionary cause? Perhaps I may be
                  preparing a missionary for the field; or a teacher for a high and noble work, who
                  will have a molding influence over mind; or an author, whose power may be felt
                  throughout the world.
               "So my Brother Arthur must make no objection to this proposal, and think not that
                  you will be receiving what belongs to Sister Barton. Nay, verily; no such thing.
                  It is from the Lord's treasury, and is not mine. I use your language, brother; I
                  remember it well."
               "So let it be; I have nothing to say against it," said Mr. Arthur.
               "The Lord will provide for the children," said Mrs. Arthur her face brightening.
                  "How Sister Barton has been prospered! We have no prospect for the four younger
                  children, but we will hope and trust
                  on: we had none for Marian and Nattie a year ago."
               And they did hope and trust on, and all the time the Lord was looking down from
                  heaven upon them, approving their faith.
               As Marian was about closing her year at school, she wrote home, requesting her
                  parents' permission to teach, saying she had been offered a school in the village,
                  and could board with Mrs. Barton.
               This arrangement her parents consented to rather reluctantly; but Mrs. Arthur
                  said, Marian would still be with her brother; that the exercise would tend to make
                  her acquired knowledge practical; that she would know how to manage children
                  better; that it would give her self-reliance; and that it would aid them
                  pecuniarily: an item of some consideration; "for we have four others coming
                  on."
               Marian entered upon what she thought might be her life's work, with a brave heart,
                  high hopes, and pure motives.
               After her term expired, the brother and sister returned home for their first
                  visit.
               O how dignified and how wise did they appear in the eyes of the other children for
                  the first half hour after their arrival!
               
                  
               
               Jennie and Frank thought Nattie nearly ready to be a president of a college, and
                  "Marian is certainly a good deal more than a 'preceptress in an academy!'"
               But the pleasure and noisy joy of the little group dispelled the enchantment.
                  Marian was Marian still and "our Nattie" could be "nobody else;" and they soon
                  came to the conclusion that their sister and brother, wise as they had grown,
                  would have to go to school another quarter before they would be quite
                  finished."
               In the evening, when all had retired except the young students, Mr. Arthur asked
                  Marian what she thought of returning to school as soon as her vacation should be
                  over.
               
               "I should prefer it above all things, if you were rich, father," replied Marian
                  "but there are four besides Nattie and me, and I have been at the Academy a year
                  now, I think I had better teach and help along the rest."
               Mr. and Mrs. Arthur exchanged glances, which seemed to say, Marian is the same
                  pure-minded girl, as regardless of self as when we parted with her a year and a
                  half ago.
               "But suppose I should tell you that I am rich, and can send you as long as you
                  desire to attend, without robbing the other children," said Mr. Arthur.
               "O, I cannot tell you how glad I should be, for I do want to go on with my
                  course," replied Marian. She checked herself, and, then went on: "I was never
                  sorry in my life, father, that I am a Methodist minister's daughter; but I have
                  sometimes thought that my chance for an education would have been better in some
                  other circumstances."
               "Well, my daughter, I have thought so too, sometimes," replied Mr. Arthur; "but as
                  wise as you think your father is, he does not always reason correctly, as what I
                  am going to relate to you will show.
               "One of the earliest acquaintances of my ministry, a good, pious, wealthy old
                  lady, whom I have not seen for many years, has recently died, and has bequeathed
                  her entire estate to benevolent purposes. Among her legacies there is a liberal
                  one for my children, which has already been placed at my disposal. If I divide the
                  amount among you all, it will, with economy, provide well for your education, and
                  she wished it appropriated in that way. What do you think now, my daughter?"
               Marian was weeping, and could not reply. But Nattie, sprung to his feet, implanted
                  a brother's kiss upon her cheek, and exclaimed:
               "There, now, Monny! You shall go back with me; I thought you would; I have thought
                  so all along."
               And he clapped his hands in his hearty way, and bounded up stairs to his little
                  room; then kneeling down, he raised his young, pure heart to God in gratitude for
                  this fresh mercy.
               O, how rich and how beautiful was the luster of the spotless robe of that young,
                  pure-minded Christian!
               "It comes from above," said he, as he returned to the parlor.
               It would be difficult to tell which was the happiest of that happy group, the father, the
                  mother, the brother, or the sister.
               That vacation was a joyous one, the first of a long run of vacations spent by the
                  minister's children at home.

                     —MONTGOMERY.
                  
               
               WILLIAM LAWRENCE had completed his course at the Academy, and was prepared to take
                  an advanced position in college. Harwell had already entered the university, and
                  Lawrence was anxious to do the same.
               His time had been interrupted by frequent terms of manual labor, to recruit his
                  means, and he now engaged in teaching for the same object.
               While teaching, the Spirit of the Lord was poured out upon the entire township,
                  and many were added to the Church. Lawrence rendered valuable aid in conducting
                  the religious exercises, and was frequently solicited to preach. This he never
                  declined doing. Many of his scholars were converted, which was a source of great
                  joy to him.
               
               After his term of teaching had expired, though he did not intend to enter upon an
                  active ministry for some time to come, yet, through the persuasions of the
                  presiding elder, and the urgent solicitations of earnest, warm-hearted brethren,
                  he was induced to supply, until Conference, the place of a minister whose health
                  had failed.
               
                  
               
               Marked success followed his efforts, and at the ensuing Annual Conference, to
                  which he had previously been recommended by the quarterly conference, which is
                  principally composed of laymen, the temperature of his heart arose to summer-heat,
                  and it required but little persuasion sion on the part of his clerical brethren to
                  induce him to take an appointment.
               He consented to this the more readily, when he considered that the necessity he
                  was under of earning the means to pursue a collegiate course as he went along,
                  would prevent him from entering the work of the ministry for several years.
               This he was then in no frame of mind to think of; and, at the close of the
                  session, his name was announced as junior preacher upon a circuit at the remotest
                  limits of the Conference.
               He saw his elder, and found that it would be practicable for him to visit his old
                  home at the hamlet before starting for his destination.
               This visit was a source of satisfaction, not only to Lawrence, but to all his old
                  friends. They met him with the warm smiles of the fireside, and the heart-whole
                  greetings of familiar, ardent friendship. They crowded around him, anxious, if
                  possible, to contribute something to his present enjoyment or future
                  convenience.
               Many agreeable surprises awaited him from day to day; but none moved him quite so
                  deeply as when, on the morning: of his departure ure, his beautiful colt "Charlie," the cherished
                  companion of his boyhood, that he had parted with so reluctantly, now a strong,
                  well-formed horse, was led up to Mr. Hatfield's door, and made over to him as the
                  rightful owner, in the name of all his friends at the hamlet.
               Lawrence smoothed his mane, and walked around him, and gazed upon him, evincing
                  great satisfaction. He had grown larger and stronger without losing his beauty and
                  grace, and seemed to have kept pace with his master in all sober-mindedness and
                  dignity.
               The young itinerant declared him to be just what he wanted, and promised himself
                  much pleasure in the companionship of this living memento of his friends, when
                  coursing his way over his circuit.
               The friends were repaid in his pleasure; and he went away, and saw them no more
                  until four years after, when he returned with his lovely and accomplished bride,
                  whom they all knew, a daughter of one of their well-beloved ministers.
               That bride was Marian Arthur.
               A beautiful compliment was that given her by the farmers: "Marian knows
                  everything, and is quite unconscious of it."
               The knowledge she had acquired had become a part of herself; had entered into the
                  blood and nerves of her intellect, and was not the superficial fastenings of
                  pedantry; consequently her learning was never displayed, nor could it be, to the
                  wondering gaze of ignorance. Superior sense and superior modesty—mother and
                  daughter—inseparable as cause and effect, or the light and the day.
               They were welcomed to the homes and the hearts of their friends with a strength of
                  affection, and a generous pride in their success, that moved their hearts and
                  charmed them to tears.
               Lawrence declared that he had never enjoyed a visit to his native village so
                  well.
               "Of course he has not," replied his friend Boynton.
               He rehearsed to his inquiring friends all his discouragements and his successes.
                  Once he had become disheartened. It was on his first circuit.
               He had left the warm temperature of home, and friends who looked with an eye of
                  complacency upon all that he did, and appreciated his talents as friendship only
                  appreciates; and he had gone among strangers who knew nothing of his early struggles, or of the genuine
                  worth and the manly, untiring energy that had brought him out.
               Some, instead of setting down his real abilities and improvements to the right
                  account, saw only deficiencies. Occasionally, he had been looked down upon by a
                  demure, self-complacent steward, or leader, as a stripling; and once had been
                  prayed at by a candid, dull brother, as "a worm with which the Lord
                     might thrash a mountain."
               Sometimes he had been noticed by a pastor of another denomination, in a
                  supercilious, patronizing way, as if he would pat him on the head, and admire his
                  soft, curling hair, and rosy cheeks.
               These were some of the trials of the young man of high-souled independence,
                  conscious of mental and moral power, on his entrance into the ministry. And these
                  had had their effect upon Lawrence; and in a moment of despondence he had turned
                  his horse's head homeward, with the intention of leaving the circuit, and
                  returning to his first plan of a more thorough preparation.
               As he passed by a little brown, weather-beaten cottage, scarcely more than a
                  hovel, he recollected that an old, blind brother resided there. The poor
                  man had always waited for him at the church door, after he had closed the
                  services, that he might feel the hand of his minister, whom he could not see.
               Lawrence who had not tarried to say good-by to any one, now reined in his horse.
                  "I must see him again," said he, as he sprung upon the cottage step.
               He had his hand upon the latch, and was about to enter, when he was arrested by
                  the voice of prayer from within. Reverently uncovering his head, there the young
                     preacher stood, and heard his own
                  cause pleaded with a fervency and a faith that nerved him with supernatural
                  strength, and made him feel that all heaven was arrayed on his side. In the
                  fullness of his heart he exclaimed, "I cannot fail!"
               Then his sky brightened, and he returned to his work, and ever after felt at home
                  in it; at home in the pulpit, at home in the vestry-meeting, at home in the
                  class-meeting and in thee praying circle, at home in the pastoral work and at the
                  conch of suffering.
               And now he felt overflowing gratitude to his heavenly Father, that he was
                  permitted to preach the Gospel.
               "I had rather be a minister of Jesus Christ, said he, "than to rule kingdoms or
                  sway empires. I would sooner accept the most humble appointment in the gift of the
                  Church, than the highest honors and most lucrative station that man has the power
                  to bestow."
               He had entered the work in the true spirit of an apostle; and when some less
                  spiritually minded, less single-hearted than himself, offered their sympathies on
                  his departure for a new and a poor circuit, he answered; "Nay, verily, I cannot
                  appreciate such motives."
               He reconnoitered each new field with the eye of a general, and laid his plans for
                  its subjection to Christ. As to popularity as a preacher, it was not even a
                  secondary motive with him.
               His leading motive was to save as many souls as he could, and how to labor, for
                  this the most successfully was the great question of his life.
               He felt under such obligations to Christ for his own salvation, that he considered
                  it a privilege to labor for his cause in any position. The heartfelt joys and
                  heavenly prospects of religion sustained him. Humiliations, poverty, reproaches,
                  did not terrify him; and while he retained such a frame of mind, they would never
                  be burdensome to him.
               While the young minister and his wife were at the hamlet, Harwell came. He had
                  graduated with honor, and also entered the itinerant ministry.
               The system that provided him a field of labor to enter upon at once he thought
                  well of, though humble that station might be; and he doubted not, that if he
                  committed his ways to the Lord, his steps would be directed into those situations
                  best adapted to his own talents, his intellectual improvement, and his growth in
                  holiness.
               
               His coming added much to the pleasure of all, and nearly everything to the
                  pleasure of one.
               The young ministers now talked over their plans for study and future improvement;
                  and Lawrence amused his friend with the novelty of many of his devices for saving
                  time and securing opportunities for reading.
               
                  
               
               It was a common thing for him to study on horseback, and in case of a shower he
                  always preferred a barn to a house. There he was not interrupted, and having no
                  company, was not expected to converse. If he was likely to arrive too soon, at his
                  stomping place, he would halt under the shade of a tree, and spend the time to a
                  better advantage than among a busy household awaiting dinner.
               In these and Various other ways, he had contrived to husband his time well.
               Harwell gave Lawrence credit for great improvement, and his easy address and
                  graceful conversational powers, and his extensive course of reading, made Harwell
                  feel that though his friend had not had the advantages of a university training,
                  he was not a whit behind him on that account.
               Lawrence had been an extensive reader, yet he was more of a thinker than a reader.
                  The simple fact that he had not had the advantages of a collegiate education, he
                  did not deem sufficient to deter him from as high a standard of intellectual
                  attainments as those privileges would procure for others. He determined to bestow
                  upon the capacities with which he was endowed so much the more painstaking, and
                  was resolved to undertake any amount of mental labor to overcome this
                  difficulty.
               None of the mustiness of books clung to his sermons, though they were carefully
                  prepared, and often fully written out. Thus he went on, improving. When he read
                  over his old sermons, he was not
                  satisfied with them; he could do better now. But in revising, an old sermon
                  occasionally, in not being pinned down to the necessity of preparing two or three
                  new ones every week, he could bestow more labor upon each, and had more time for
                  other literary pursuits; and what was of yet more importance, he had time for
                  pastoral visiting, and superior opportunities for studying men and things.
               His theory was to do thoroughly, and with perfect accuracy, whatever be undertook,
                  and then to advance boldly into new fields.
               He had a keen mental appetite, a relish for intellectual pursuits, and strong
                  digestive powers, so that the great truths of science and of knowledge entered
                  into the elements of his mind well matured, imparting to them strength, expansion,
                  and elasticity.
               The young minister thought it cowardly to acknowledge even to himself, that he was
                  inadequate to the mental labor of grappling any subject or accomplishing any task
                  demanded by his highest efficiency. It might, he allowed, require more time, than
                  for an intellect of greater power, or one that had been favored with better
                  discipline, but the final triumph of perseverance he considered complete and
                  certain.
               He would attain to eminence, or eminent success, later in life, his step would be
                  slower, but the goal was inevitable. No hinderances thwarted him from his purpose;
                  he was never discouraged, never irresolute.
               A shade of regret passed over Harwell's mind that he had not entered the itinerant
                  ministry, instead of entering college. He said he was not sure but that it was the
                  best college in the world.
               "I am now thirty-five," said he; "my life is probably half spent already, and I am
                  but just prepared to enter the field."
               "So was our great founder, John Wesley, before he entered upon his life's work. I
                  suppose you would be satisfied to accomplish as much as he did," replied
                  Lawrence.
               "Thank you for that idea; it is consoling," replied Harwell, still seemingly lost
                  in thought.
               "You bring to the work," continued Lawrence, "a mind inured to labor, and
                  strengthened by grappling with difficulties. With your training, what has been
                  difficult for me, will be but pastime for you, you are prepared to do more in one
                  year in intellectual advancement than I
                  have in two. You can enter upon stations for which I have been inadequate. I must
                  work on slowly and patiently against difficulties that you have overcome. Yet I am
                  resolved, in spite of all this, to gird on the whole armor."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               
                  
                     
                        "Go and sow beside all waters,
                        In the morning of thy youth;
                        In the evening, scatter broadcast
                        Precious seeds of living truth.
                     
                     
                        "And thy soul may see the value
                        Of its patient morns and eves,
                        When the everlasting garner
                        Shall be fill'd with precious sheaves."
                     
                  
               
               THE day for the departure of the visitors from the hamlet now drew near. But one
                  was not to return as he came—alone. 
               Mary Hatfield whose intelligence, consistent piety, and earnest, loving nature,
                  had won the student's heart several years before—the pure, meek, gentle,
                  sunny-hearted Mary—Harwell was about to bear away in triumph to the little
                  parsonage that awaited them far away among the hills, to be the light of his
                  eyrie, and the heart of his home.
               Good Farmer Hatfield and his wife, as years had flowed onward, had grown more
                     lovable, more spiritual, and were
                  passing down the declivity of life, with their glories clustering thick awaited
                  them.
               Dwight and Crecia were grown larger and taller, but they still had the tender,
                  affectionate hearts of childhood. They were together as usual, in all their plans
                  and provisions for the pleasure of the company, and acted, on the present
                  occasion, precisely as if they had done nothing their lives long, but set things
                  in order for weddings.
               The ceremony was performed by Lawrence—the bride would have nobody else—at the
                  place where a similar ceremony had been performed by Mr. Arthur a few years
                  before; and the bride of that occasion was present in charming matronly dignity.
                  The doctor is by her side, and still playfully affirms, that it was his wife, and
                  no other, Solomon had in his eye when he wrote the last chapter of Proverbs.
               Lawrence and Harwell have no inclination to dispute the point with him; and one
                  would think they were of the opinion that their young brides had improved even on
                  Solomon's model.
               Our young friends received a flattening welcome at the homes that awaited
                  them.
               Marian and Lawrence commenced housekeeping in two upper rooms—the, only place that
                  could be procured in the neighborhood. These had been furnished partly by the
                  society; and as they were building a parsonage, which would be completed in a few
                  months, they had the prospect of a more convenient abode.
               The young minister and his wife were eager for its completion. They had more room
                  in their hearts for their friends than in their house, and were unwilling to
                  remain long in a situation where they could not receive them, and entertain them
                  pleasantly.
               Harwell and Mary took possession of their little unadorned cottage-home, full of
                  sunny hopes, and grateful that their long-cherished desires for usefulness might
                  now be realized.
               The young bride's heart is as warm, and her hand is as open as ever; and a more
                  hospitable home or a warmer welcome one could not find.
               The carpets are of home manufacture; and the pine tables, the paper curtains, and
                  plain earthen ware, reveal their simple style of living, and the pecuniary
                  circumstances of the people. The society is new, and is a mission station, They are satisfied that their friends
                  have done what they could; they live as well as the members of their society, and
                  are happy and contented.
               A large stuffed chair, in the pleasantest place in the room, a specimen of Mary's
                  ingenuity and industry, is occupied by an old lady, whose face is ever pervaded
                  with a smile of serene joy and hope; and whose eye beams with the light and the
                  love of paradise.
               That old lady is Harwell's mother.
               They love to have her there; that pure spirit is a link that connects them with
                  heaven.
               Harwell's noble struggles have been rewarded. Friends leave rallied around him,
                  and assisted him; and now, mother and son rejoice in a happy reunion, and Mary is
                  sure a blessing will be upon their house, now mother is there.
               That mother is proud of her children; and who will chide her? Every relic of her
                  "John's" college life is cherished by her. That old worn-out cost, the seams of
                  which had been inked so often, he had left at home during one of his vacations.
                  This she had carefully preserved, and brought with her to her new home. Proud
                  beauty had curled her lip in scorn at it; but the loving, grateful mother stooped
                  and kissed it. It recalled all his privations and his efforts in her behalf.
                  Dearer to her was it than the robes of kings; nobler than the needlework of
                  imperial beauty on fabrics of gold.
               A large, beautifully bound family Bible lies on the stand. Lawrence and Marian
                  have one just like it; they are wedding gifts from their mutual friend Boynton,
                  the tried and true.
               Harwell does not know how much he is indebted to him for the frequent and liberal
                  aid he received while pursuing his college course; but Mary says, "It is just like
                  Brother Boynton, and must have been him," and she has conjectured right.
               The beneficent man has grown wealthy in his generosity and still quotes his
                  favorite scripture: "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is
                  that withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty."
               Lawrence and Harwell both belonged to the same Conference, and were on the same
                  district; and, what added to their pleasure, Mr. Arthur was their presiding elder.
                  Their appointments were not many miles apart, and they promised themselves the
                  pleasure of meeting often.
               Lawrence and Marian made the first visit. This, as might be supposed, was a happy meeting, and they spent several days
                  together.
               While there they received a call from their old acquaintance, Mr. Safford.
               He had taken a full university course, and had been a year in a theological
                  seminary of long standing and celebrity.
               His consequential ways contrasted with his mincing, affected manner of addressing
                  the ladies, and Marian and Mary soon decided that he would be no favorite of
                  theirs. He was full of complaints as usual; "he was not appreciated."
               "We have spent our time," said he, "yes, years in hard study; now this is all the
                  encouragement we get. We are sent to poor little stations or circuits, to be but
                  half supported; to a people that can comprehend nothing beyond the spelling book.
                  They are unlettered and ignorant, and have never had their minds enlarged by
                  culture. They cannot comprehend a finished sermon, and stare at a classical
                  allusion. My presiding elder does not appreciate me, or he would never have
                  consented to my occupying such a position. My people, I am sure, do not understand
                  my preaching. They cannot comprehend it."
               "Very likely," whispered Marian, with a merry look toward Mary. She was as keen to
                  detect the ridiculous points of human character as Lawrence himself. Now she dared
                  not meet his mirthful eye; and Safford added:
               "I have to make an effort to bring myself down to their capacities. Last Sabbath I
                  preached from the text, 'Howsoever, let all thy wants rest on me.' You will find
                  it in Judges," turning to Marian and Mary. "I entirely ignore the antiquated
                  notion of giving the connection of the text. In reducing the subject to a
                  categorical proposition it evolves the topic—the wants of man—a truly sublime
                  topic. It is of a complex character, and the natural order into which it divides
                  itself is fourfold—Man's wants, physical, social, intellectual, and moral. In my
                  prolegomena, that is to say, in my proem or exordium, introduction, I ought to
                  have said, for the benefit of the ladies present, I treated first on the term of
                  syncategorematica 'howsoever,' which, in the text, is very significant; augmenting
                  greatly the meaning of the proposition. Then I dwelt at length on man in general,
                  his creation, his state in the garden, his fall and its consequences, his general
                  history, and his present conditions—a
                  creature of wants, emphatically a creature of wants."
               "And I hope you did not fail to mention, that man is the only animal who, when
                  full fed and in good condition, is ever complaining," added Lawrence; "but go
                  on."
               "My observations and explications were generally eminently theological; and I
                  entered into explanations of the terms prolegomena and syncategorematica, and then
                  I pushed on into the heart of my subject—the wants of man, First, man's wants,
                  physical—as food, clothing, houses to live in, and so on. I thought it best to
                  treat of these subjects in a very plain way, as I was myself interested; and I did
                  not fail to make my interests known, in alluding to the state of my own finances.
                  Secondly, man's wants, social. This naturally evolves itself into two distinct
                  divisions—man's wants matrimonial, and man's wants patriarchal. Here I went into
                  an elaborate explanation of terms, giving the Latin from which these words are
                  derived, their meaning in the original, and the numerous English words derived
                  from them. The third and fourth divisions of my text were passed slightly over for
                  want of time, and as less important. The peroration I consider one of my happiest
                  efforts. My summing up, and recapitulation of prolegomenary remarks of arguments
                  and quotations, were in my very best style."
               "And for the 'benefit of the ladies,' you ought to have sat down repeating the
                  text, 'Howsoever, let all thy wants rest on me,'" said Marian, with playful
                  irony.
               "But," said Safford, coming at last to the main question with him, "how much
                  salary do your people pay you here, Harwell?"
               "Indeed, to confess the truth, I have not found that out yet. I am quite behind
                  the times, am I not?" replied Harwell, smiling.
               "You are surely," replied Safford. "I look to that the first thing. If you are not
                  careful, you may find yourself in arrears."
               "Very possible," replied Harwell; "and I may, if I am careful. But if I am
                  faithful to the society, I trust they will be to me. I expect to be
                  supported."
               "Well, I always look to that the first thing," said Safford; 'the laborer is
                  worthy of his hire, you know."
               "Certainly; but it is well for a preacher to make the impression, as an old lady
                  once said, 'that he is not after the loaves and fishes, but that he is after the miracles," replied
                  Lawrence.
               This sally, as was intended, changed the drift of the conversation, and Harwell
                  observed: "Brother Safford, my society is new, and is a mission station. They have
                  already given evidence that they are in earnest in their intentions to support
                  their minister. It is not well for us to be too particular in this matter.
               "When we think of the agony of the Redeemer in the garden," continued Harwell,
                  seriously, "and of his death upon the cross, the glory he left, and the heaven he
                  has prepared for us, we ought not to inquire how little we must suffer or do, for
                  his cause, and how well we must be paid for it; or to demand that our couch be
                  made soft, and our table spread with dainties."
               Harwell paused, and Lawrence continued: "God has appointed us to labor, and his
                  Church to support us," said he. "Let us look well to our own duty. If we perform
                  it faithfully, they will do theirs; or if we are called to suffer through their
                  neglect, God will make it a blessing to us. The discipline may be precisely what
                  we need to develop some dormant power, or nourish some languishing virtue. The
                  Captain of our salvation was made perfect through suffering; and happy shall we be
                  if we attain to tritest excellence, even though it be in the furnace of
                  affliction. Our churches ought to do better than they do; but they have never been
                  trained to the Gospel standard of liberality. In some places they are sinfully
                  negligent; but this state of things will not continue long. A better day is
                  dawning upon the Church; and when she brings her tithes, which have so long been
                  withheld, into the storehouse of the Lord, then will the blessing from heaven be
                  poured out upon her, until there shall be no room to receive it. Covetousness has
                  closed the heart of the Church against God; and we must be careful that this sin
                  does not lie at our own door. It will not certainly help the case for the minister
                  to set the example of penuriousness. However, in a wealthy society, where the
                  fault should lie with a close-fisted board, I would speak out; some of whom, it
                  must be confessed, seem to think, as a humorous preacher once remarked, that a
                  minister's 'quarterage means a quarter of a dollar.'
               "But if we ever feel like repining or murmuring that we are hardly dealt by, and
                  oppressed in being sent to places where the very fact that we are not well sustained shows that
                  our labors are most needed there, it will help us to remember the infinite
                  obligations we are under to Christ—obligations we can never satisfy.
               "If the heart, baptized and vivified by Divine grace, should constantly overflow
                  with gratitude and thanksgiving; and if it should seek and improve every
                  opportunity to do good within its power, still it would not be satisfied. Then, to
                  suffer for Christ would be sweet, and in tribulation the soul would rejoice. I am
                  not careful as to the way in which I shall be led, or the positions in which I
                  shall be placed; for I trust to that Providence to whom I have committed all my
                  ways, that they will be precisely such as shall be best for myself. A high degree
                  of spirituality, and entire consecration to God, are indispensable requisites to
                  the work of the ministry, which holds out few inducements to sloth, or
                  selfishness, or ambition."
               The manner of Lawrence was earnest, forcible, and convincing; and he had the power
                  of communicating his own depth of feeling to those whom he addressed. His voice
                  was full and musical, and his eye varied with the feelings of his heart, and the
                  thoughts that stirred them. This subject always inspired him, and he talked
                  on.
               The rays of the Sun of Righteousness beaming full upon his soul had daguerreotyped
                  all the graces of the Spirit in heavenly clearness there; and the truths he
                  uttered, welling up from its depths, moved all hearts.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Tranquil amid alarms,
                           Death found him in the field—
                           A veteran, slumb'ring on his arms
                           Beneath his red-cross shield;
                           His sword was in his hand,
                           Still warm with recent fight,
                           Ready, that moment, at command,
                           Through rock and steel to smite.
                        
                        
                           At midnight came the cry,
                           "To meet thy God prepare!"
                           He woke, and caught his Captain's eye.
                           Then, strong in faith and prayer,
                           His spirit, with a bound,
                           Burst its encumb'ring clay;
                           His tent at sunrise on the ground
                           A darken'd ruin lay.
                        
                     
                     —MONTGOMERY.
                  
               
               OUR young friends are now entered upon their life's work. The beginning may appear
                  small to those who judge from appearances alone. One could suppose Harwell might
                  feel like complaining, after having passed through a brilliant collegiate course
                  with high literary honors, to be sent to minister to a little flock, scattered
                  over an uncultivated waste; or that Lawrence, whose literary attainments were
                  hardly less, and whose natural qualifications were superior, might have thought he
                  was deserving a higher or a more prominent position, after a successful ministry
                  of four years. Not so thought these young men.
               Safford for a time, with his canvas spread to the breeze, outsailed them.
               What then? Their work was not to dazzle, but to do good. They had their eye fixed
                  on the distant and the permanent; he, upon the present and the transitory. Their
                  fields of labor were small, but they needed their cultivation, and being limited,
                  how much better could they improve them.
               No space was left for noxious plants; no shrub was left unpruned. These barren
                  wastes might become, under their faithful care, gardens of the Lord. And they
                  highly prized the opportunity afforded them for improving their own skill, and
                  making themselves workmen that need not to be ashamed.
               The baleful effects of a mushroom growth in the ministry had been marked by them.
                  The premature superannuation of many who were truly worthy, who had been pushed
                  into stations of great responsibility
                  without that prudence and tact in management that experience secures and the
                  preparation for pulpit labors which a longer probation would have afforded them;
                  or the unimpassioned confidence in their own power a more extended trial in the
                  ministry would have imparted to them, were so many lights that pointed out the
                  rocks upon which they might be stranded.
               The young ministers pressed on in their work, performing what their hands found to
                  do with their might. The result was, that they were eminently successful, and were
                  becoming weighty men; men that were desired in, and equal to the most responsible
                  stations in the Church; men whom their brethren delighted to honor.
               Safford, whose eye and appeals were sure to reach the breast pockets of his
                  parishioners, if not their hearts, remained but a short time in the ministry. He
                  was never appreciated, as he constantly affirmed, and still complained that he was
                  not appointed to higher stations of honor and emolument. At length, resolved to
                  make his power felt in the Church and the world, he set sail for Europe to finish
                  his theological course in a German University. Here he soon had a falling out with
                  all theology, and then turned to travel. He promises his "friends and mankind
                  generally," that his "notes and observations on ancient Greece and ancient towers,
                  on bridges, pyramids, aqueducts, and sights, shall be a book of travels, the want
                  of which has long been felt," and we doubt not such a work will be duly
                  "appreciated."
               We turn again to Mr. and Mrs. Arthur. Their children were now mostly grown up to
                  be men and women, and some of them were already occupying spheres of usefulness
                  and trust, and what was still better, they recognized their obligations to God,
                  and were endeavoring to fulfill them.
               The eldest was the wife of an itinerant minister, well fitted by intellectual and
                  moral culture, and by natural endowments, for her important position, and an honor
                  to it.
               Nathaniel was now in the ministry, and bade fair to follow in the footsteps of his
                  father, with even a more brilliant tread.
               Jennie and Frankie are still inseparable. Jennie is the wife of the brave-hearted
                  Edward Barton, who makes just such a man as his boyhood promised.
               He entered into partnership with the firm, and has seen both partners borne away
                  to the grave. He is now at the head of
                  the establishment, and Frank Arthur is his partner.
               His brothers have both entered the ministry, and his beloved and honored mother
                  has a suite of rooms fitted up expressly for her in his own mansion, where she is
                  spending a serene old age in comfort and affluence. She has long since conveyed
                  her annuity to the widow of a minister and her fatherless children.
               Edward Barton has a passion for making money, but enjoys much better the privilege
                  of giving it away. He considers himself God's steward, and all that he possesses
                  as belonging to him. Among his other liberalities he supplies his mother yearly
                  with a handsome sum, to bestow as she pleases.
               Jennie makes an affectionate wife and daughter, and honors and cherishes the
                  mother of her husband as if she was her own.
               Frank declared himself resolved to live a bachelor, but a summer tour with Jennie
                  through the country, and a week at good Farmer Hatfield's, changed his
                  resolution.
               On their return home, Jennie told him, of all the girls in the world, she thought
                  Crecia Hatfield was the best.
               To this he frankly responded, "I think so too, Jennie; and that is not all: I am
                  resolved to bring her to dwell near you, if I can persuade her to come."
               And Crecia listened to Frank's persuasions, and the little playfellows who had
                  built houses of pine branches, "all for themselves," and had drank tea together
                  from tiny cups, now concluded that they would "play keep house," as other people
                  did.
               Dwight Hatfield is left with his father and mother alone. But Frank declares he
                  will not remain so long. He is a physician. Dr. Richmond has become wealthy, and
                  wishing to be released from the duties of his profession, Dwight has already taken
                  them upon himself.
               The good farmer and his wife are journeying on toward the setting sun of their
                  earthly existence in serenity and hope. Earth-born shadows are clearing away, and
                  the perpetual sunshine of God's presence illumines their pathway to the world of
                  light.
               The earnest-hearted Boynton, though years have whitened his locks, still walks on
                  with a firm step and an undimmed eye, and is as great a favorite with the young as
                  he has been with those who are passing off the stage of action. His piety has
                  deepened, and as he nears the goal a
                  heavenly radiance pervades his dignified, manly features, and they speak of a
                  heart at peace with God, and in love with all mankind.
               There remains but little to be told. Mr. and Mrs. Arthur never seemed to lose the
                  dewiness and freshness of youth. He never became superannuated, and while he lived
                  performed effective service. They had braved the battles of life, and had been
                  victors, and now they lived a new life in their children.
               It seemed like commencing life's journey anew, when their children had gone out
                  from their fireside, and they were left almost alone again. Addie, their youngest
                  born, was with them, and the thoughtful, inquiring boy Charlie, now in college,
                  spent his vacations at home.
               And the faithful Nancy, who had never left them? This pious servant was not
                  forgotten. She had clung to Mrs. Arthur with a sister's affection in her early
                  struggles for her young family. A home was provided for her in the house of Frank,
                  when she should be past active service, and her mistress should need her no
                  more.
               The bow of love and peace spanned the horizon of the aged minister and his wife,
                  and angels trooped nightly about their couch. With hearts that had ever turned
                  toward the sunshine, and overflowing with kindliest feelings toward all, they were
                  now passing joyfully homeward to that fair land where clouds do not come, and the
                  sky is always bright.
               There they hope to gather together again each member of their own family, and all
                  those who have been brought to righteousness through their instrumentality, when
                  earth and earthly things are no more. Then those voices which have so often united
                  in celebrating, the praises of the Redeemer on earth, will blend again in the
                  music of seraphs.
               In their deaths they were scarcely divided. Mr. Arthur closed the eyes of his
                  angelic Mary, and left her to sleep undisturbed until the morning of the
                  resurrection; and a few months after he was laid by her side.
               Roses, placed there by affection's hand, bloom and fade, where they are
                  slumbering; but they live in perennial beauty in the garden of God.
               
                  
                     
                        "How blest the righteous when he dies!
                        When sinks a weary soul to rest!
                        How mildly beam the closing eyes!
                        How gently heaves th' expiring breast!
                     
                     
                        
                        "So fades a summer cloud away;
                        So sinks the gale when storms are o'er;
                        So gently shuts the eye of day;
                        So dies a wave along the shore.
                     
                     
                        "A holy quiet reigns around,
                        A calm which life nor death destroys;
                        And naught disturbs that peace profound,

            DON'T FORGET
            The Sunday School Advocate
            This is now strictly a child's paper, as ordered by the General Conference. It is
               most elegantly illustrated, beautifully printed, and fitted in every respect to
               attract, instruct, and save the children. We need not say that, considering the
               number and beauty of illustrations, and the elegant manner in which it is brought
               out, it is, at least, as cheap as any child's paper in the country. We now print
               about one hundred and ten thousand at New-York, and the Cincinnati
               agents print fifty thousand. But our list is rapidly increasing, and
               must be doubled.

               The above series of question-books are carefully prepared, and well adapted to
                  meet the demands of such teachers as prefer to study the Gospels as they are
                  arranged in the New Testament, instead of in their chronological order, as in
                  Longking's Questions. Let them be used freely. They are cheap as the cheapest, and
                  equal to the best question-books in the market.

                   This manual has stood the test of a fair trial. Many of the most
                  successful teachers of infant classes are enthusiastic in their praise of its
                  fitness for the infant department of our Sunday schools. It covers the whole
                  ground of Scripture story in a series of lessons, which contain the facts to be
                  taught mainly in the questions. The answers are very brief. By this means the
                  child acquires a large amount of Scripture history without having its memory
                  over-burdened with words. Let it be scattered broadcast in our families and infant
                  schools. Buy it in parts for the children, and in one volume for the use of
                  parents and teachers.
