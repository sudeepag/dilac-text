            Putnam's Story Library.
            The Best Stories of The Best Authors.
            NOW FIRST COLLECTED.
            Price 75 cts. per Vol. Cloth, uniform binding, Library style. 50 cts. Paper.
            The design of these Publications is to present to the public, in a form suitable for
               amusing and attractive reading, and for permanent library use, the best selections
               from the standard story literature of the English language. A good story is always
               acceptable to all classes of readers, and this collection, we think, will be
               welcomed, as supplying a deficiency which now exists in most libraries.
            It has been the aim of the editor to render each volume of the series suitable and
               attractive to the traveller, pleasant to the home circle, worthy of the library—books
               which either at the seaside or fire-side, by the river or the rail, may best serve to
               while away a weary half-hour, when closeness of attention is impossible, and the very
               idea of a lengthened narrative is oppressive.
            Each volume of the series is complete in itself.

               Opinions of the Press.
               A good story—a story which is nothing but a story, without a religious, political,
                  or social purpose—is a good thing; one of the best things in literature, and hard
                  to be found now-a-days, except in this collection.—N. Y. Courier and
                     Enquirer.
               No pleasanter book can be found for the seaside or the fireside; on the steamer or
                  in the car.—Springfield Republican.
               The taste for story reading is universal; the first book in which childhood
                  becomes interested is a book of tales, and the love of works of fiction remains
                  through life. When tales are written in a pure and chaste style; when they
                  interest us in behalf of virtue and render vice more odious; when they excite our
                  best sympathies and inculcate good morals, they become good teachers. Too often
                  the field of fiction is invaded by the chiffoniers of literature, and the most
                  improbable and extravagant events are detailed in a bloated and exaggerated style,
                  garnished with immorality, calculated to deprave the taste and corrupt the heart.
                  Of such a nature are the stories of the flash newspapers and twenty-five cent
                  yellow-covered pamphlets foisted into circulation by extravagant puffing. In the
                  volume before us we have a series of charming tales, as instructive as they are
                  interesting. The work is neatly got up, and should become a part of every genteel
                  library in the land.—Brooklyn Eagle.
               The stories in these volumes are beautiful in every respect—unexceptionable in
                  tone, of great variety, and suited to both sexes and all ages. For half-hour
                  reading we know of nothing to take their place.—City Item,
                     Philadelphia.
               G. P. Putnam & Co. have commenced a publication the success of which is
                  certain. They propose to collect in a series of volumes the best tales and stories
                  of the last fifty years, many of them quite unknown to the present generation of
                  readers, and all worthy of re-perusal, either from their intrinsic charms as
                  narrative compositions, or for novelty of incident and beauty of
                     style.—Boston Transcript.
               Whoever compiled this book did a kindly thing for the lovers of good stories. Many
                  of the stories are old acquaintances, but they are favorites whom we are glad to
                  meet again and again. There is not a poor or even a "middling" story in the whole
                  collection, which numbers twenty-two, and is of all varieties—sentimental,
                  pathetic, tragic, and humorous.—Boston Telegraph.
               Many a lover of good reading has moments when nothing larger in extent than one of
                  these tales can fix his attention, and yet he will be vexed if he finds himself
                  entangled in one of the trashy stories of the day. By having recourse to the
                  "Story Library," he will be sure of something good.—Worcester
                     Palladium.

               Story of the Baked Head.
               THE present Khon-khor*
                   of Roum is a staunch Mussulman, and a rigid upholder of the true faith.
                  Upon his coming to the throne, he announced his intention of doing away with many
                  customs common to the infidels, which had crept into the administration of the
                  state during the reign of his predecessor; and he thought it his duty to endeavor
                  to restore things to their primitive simplicity, and to adopt a mode of government
                  purely Turkish. Accordingly he resumed a custom which had almost got into
                  disuse—that of going about the city in tebdil,
                  or disguise; and he was so careful about the disguises which he adopted, and the
                  people whom he admitted into his secrets on these occasions, that he took all
                  sorts of precautions, and invented all sorts of schemes of secresy, in whatever
                  related to his dresses, and the characters in which he chose to appear.
               
                  
                     Khon-khor, literally "blood drinker;" so
                     the sultan of Roum, or Turkey, is styled
                     in Persia.
               
               It is not long ago that considerable discontent prevailed throughout Turkey, and
                  rebellion threatened to break out in
                  Constantinople itself. He was then very anxious to ascertain the temper of the
                  public mind; and, in his usual wary manner, determined to get a suit made that
                  would make him undiscoverable by even his own immediate attendants.
               He usually sent for different tailors at different times, and in different places.
                  On this occasion, he ordered his favorite slave, the white eunuch, Mansouri, to
                  bring him one of no repute, with all the requisite secresy, at midnight, in order
                  that he might receive instructions about a dress.
               The slave, in great humility, made his bash
                     ustum (on my head be it), and went his way to execute the
                  command.
               Close to the gate of the Bezesten, or
                  cloth-market, he saw an old man in a stall so narrow that he could scarce turn
                  himself about in it, who was taken up in patching an old cloak. He was almost bent
                  double with constant labor at his shop-board; and his eyes seemed not to have
                  benefited by his application, for a pair of glasses were mounted on his nose.
                  "This is precisely the man I want," said the slave to himself: "I am sure he can
                  be of no repute." So intent was he upon his work, that he did not heed the
                  salutation of "Peace be with you, friend!" with which Mansouri accosted him; and
                  when he did look up, and saw the well-dressed personage who he thought had spoken,
                  he continued his work without making the usual reply; for he could not suppose
                  that the salutation was meant for such a poor devil as he.
               However, finding that he was the object of the eunuch's attention, he doffed the
                  spectacles, threw away his work, and was about getting on his legs, when he was
                  stopped, and requested not to disturb himself.
               "What is your name?" said Mansouri.
               "Abdallah," said the tailor, "at your service; but I am generally called Babadul
                  by my friends, and the world at large."
               "You are a tailor, are you not?" continued the slave.
               "Yes," said the other; "I am a tailor as well as the muezzin at the little mosque
                  in the fish-market. What more can I do?"
               "Well, Babadul," said Mansouri, "have you a mind for a job—a good job?"
               "Am I a fool," answered the old man, "that I should dislike it? Say what it
                  is."
               "Softly, my friend," remarked the eunuch; "we must go on slow and sure. Will you
                  suffer yourself to be led blindfolded, at midnight, wherever I choose to take you,
                  for a job?"
               "That's another question," said Badabul; "times are critical, heads fly in
                  abundance, and a poor tailor's may go as well as a vizier's or a capitan pacha's.
                  But pay me well, and I believe I would make a suit of clothes for Eblis, the foul
                  fiend, himself."
               "Well, then, you agree to my proposal?" said the eunuch, who at the same time put
                  two pieces of gold in his hand.
               "Yes, most surely," said Babadul, "I agree. Tell me what I am to do, and you may
                  depend upon me."
               Accordingly they settled between them that the eunuch was to come to the stall at
                  midnight, and lead him away blindfolded.
               Babadul, being left alone, continued his work, wondering what could be the job
                  upon which he was to be so mysteriously employed; and, anxious to make his wife a
                  partaker of the news of his good luck, he shut up his stall earlier than usual,
                  and went to his house, that was situated not far from the little mosque in the
                  fish-market, of which he was the muezzin.
               
               Old Dilferîb, his wife, was almost as much bent double as her husband; and in
                  consequence of the two gold pieces, and in contemplation of more which they
                  expected to receive, they treated themselves to a dish of smoking kabobs, a salad, dried grapes, and sweetmeats, after
                  which they consoled themselves with some of the hottest and most bitter coffee
                  which the old woman could make.
               True to his appointment, Babadul was at his stall at midnight, where he was as
                  punctually met by Mansouri. Without any words, the former permitted himself to be
                  blindfolded, whilst the latter led him away by the hand, making many and devious
                  turns, until they reached the imperial seraglio; there, stopping only to open the
                  private iron gate, Mansouri introduced the tailor into the very heart of the
                  sultan's private apartments. The bandage over his eyes was taken off in a dark
                  chamber, lighted up only by a small lamp, which stood on the shelf surrounding the
                  top of the room, but which was splendidly furnished by sofas of the richest
                  brocade, and by carpets of the most costly manufacture. Here Babadul was commanded
                  to sit, until Mansouri returned with a bundle, wrapped in a large shawl
                  handkerchief; this being opened, a sort of dervish's dress was displayed to the
                  tailor, and he was requested to look at it, to consider how long he would be
                  making such a one, and then to return it again, duly folded up, to its shawl
                  covering. In the meanwhile, Mansouri told him to stay there until he should return
                  to take him away again, and then left him.
               Babadul, having turned the dress over and over again, calculated each stitch, and
                  come to its proper conclusions, packed it up in the handkerchief as he had been
                  commanded; but no sooner had he done this, than a man of lofty demeanor and
                  appearance, whose look made the poor tailor shrink within himself, came into the
                  room, took up the bundle, and walked away with it, without uttering a single
                  word.
               A few minutes after, as Babadul was pondering over the strangeness of his
                  situation, and just recovering from the effects of this apparition, a door opened
                  in another part of the apartment, and a mysterious figure, richly dressed, came
                  in, bearing a bundle, equally covered with a shawl, about the size of that which
                  had just been taken away; and making the lowest prostrations before the tailor, in
                  great apparent trepidation, approached him, placed it at his feet, kissed the
                  ground, and retreated without saying a word, or even looking up.
               "Well," said Babadul to himself, "this may be something very fine, and I may be
                  some very great personage, for aught I know; but this is very certain, that I had
                  rather be patching my old cloak in the stall than doing this job, however grand
                  and lucrative it may be. Who knows what I may have been brought here for? These
                  comings in and goings out of strange-looking people, apparently without tongues in
                  their heads, do not argue well. I wish they would give me fewer bows and a greater
                  supply of words, from which I might learn what I am to get by all this. I have
                  heard of poor women having been sewn up in sacks and thrown into the sea. Who
                  knows? perhaps I am destined to be the tailor on such an occasion."
               He had scarcely got thus far in his soliloquy, when the slave Mansouri re-entered
                  the room, and told him, without more words, to take up the bundle; which having
                  done, his eyes were again blindfolded, and he was led to the spot from whence he
                  came. Babadul, true to his agreement, asked no questions, but agreed with the
                  slave that in three days the dress should be ready for delivery at his stall, for
                  which he was to receive ten more pieces of gold.
               Having got rid of his companion, he proceeded with all haste to his house, where he knew his wife would be
                  impatiently waiting his return; and as he walked onwards he congratulated himself
                  that at length he had succeeded in getting indeed a job worth the having, and that
                  his fate had finally turned up something good for his old age. It was about two
                  o'clock in the morning when he reached the door of his house. He was received by
                  his wife with expressions of great impatience at his long absence; but when he
                  held up the bundle to her face, as she held up the lamp to his, and when he said,
                     "Mujdeh, give me a reward for good news: see,
                  I have got my work, and a handsome reward we shall get when it is finished," she
                  was all smiles and good humor.
               "Leave it there till we get up, and let us go to bed now," said the tailor.
               "No, no," said the wife; "I must look at what you have got before I retire, or I
                  shall not be able to sleep;" upon which, whilst he held up the lamp, she opened
                  the bundle. Guess, guess at the astonishment of the tailor and his wife, when,
                  instead of seeing a suit of clothes, they discovered, wrapped in a napkin, in its
                  most horrid and ghastly state, a human head!
               It fell from the old woman's hands, and rolled away some paces, whilst the
                  horror-struck couple first hid their faces with their hands, and then looked at
                  each other with countenances which nothing can describe.
               "Work!" cried the wife, "work, indeed! pretty work you have made of it! Was it
                  necessary to go so far, and to take such precautions, to bring this misfortune on
                  our heads? Did you bring home this dead man's head to make a suit of clothes
                  of?"
               "Anna senna! Baba senna! Curses be on his
                  mother! Perdition seize his father!" exclaimed the poor tailor, "for bringing me
                  into this dilemma. My heart misgave me as that dog of an eunuch talked of
                  blindfoldings and silence to me: I thought, as true as I am a Turk, that the job
                  could not consist only in making a suit of clothes; and sure enough this dog's son
                  has tacked a head to it. Allah! Allah! what am I to do now? I know not the way to
                  his home, or else I would take it back to him immediately, and throw it in his
                  face. We shall have the bostangi bashi, and a hundred other bashis, here in a
                  minute, and we shall be made to pay the price of blood; or, who knows, be hung, or
                  drowned, or impaled! What shall we do, eh, Dilferîb, my soul, say?"
               "Do!" said his wife; "get rid of the head, to be sure: we have no more right to
                  have it palmed upon us than anybody else."
               "But the day will soon dawn," said the tailor, "and then it will be too late. Let
                  us be doing something at once."
               "A thought has struck me," said the old woman. "Our neighbor, the baker, Hassan,
                  heats his oven at this hour, and begins soon after to bake his bread for his
                  morning's customers. He frequently has different sorts of things to bake from the
                  neighboring houses, which are placed near the oven's mouth over night: suppose I
                  put this head into one of our earthen pots and send it to be baked; nobody will
                  find it out until it is done, and then we need not send for it, so it will remain
                  on the baker's hands."
               Badabul admired his wife's sagacity, and forthwith she put her plan into
                  execution. When the head had been placed in a baking-pan, she watched a moment
                  when nobody was at hand, and set it on the ground, in the same row with the other
                  articles that were to be inserted in Hassan's oven. The old couple then
                  double-barred the door of their house, and retired to rest, comforting themselves
                  with the acquisition of the fine shawl and napkin in which the head had been
                  wrapped.
               
               The baker Hassan and his son Mahmûd were heating their oven, inserting therein
                  thorns, chips, and old rubbish, at a great rate, when their attention was arrested
                  by the extraordinary whinings and barking of a dog, that was a constant customer
                  at the oven for stray bits of bread, and much befriended by Hassan and his son,
                  who were noted for being conscientious Mussulmans.
               "Look, Mahmûd," said the father to the son; "see what is the matter with the dog;
                  something extraordinary is in the wind."
               The son did what his father bade him; and seeing no reason for the dog's noises,
                  said, "Bir chey yok, There is nothing," and
                  drove him away.
               But the howlings not ceasing, Hassan went himself, and found the dog most
                  extremely intent upon smelling and pointing at the tailor's pipkin. He jumped upon
                  Hassan, then at the pot, then upon Hassan again, until the baker no longer doubted
                  that the beast took great interest in its contents. He therefore gently drew off
                  the lid, when, need I mention his horror and surprise at seeing a human head
                  staring him in the face?
               "Allah! Allah!" cried the baker; but being a man of strong nerves, instead of
                  letting it fall, as most people would have done, he quietly put on the lid again,
                  and called his son to him.
               "Mahmûd," said he, "this is a bad world, and there are bad men in it. Some wicked
                  infidel has sent a man's head to bake; but, thanks to our good fortune, and to the
                  dog, our oven has been saved from pollution, and we can go on making our bread
                  with clean hands and clear consciences. But since the devil is at work, let others
                  have a visit from him as well as ourselves. If it be known that we have had a dead
                  man's head to bake, who will ever employ us again? We must starve, we must shut up
                  our oven; we shall get the reputation of mixing up our dough with human grease,
                  and if perchance a hair is found, it will immediately be said that it came from
                  the dead man's beard."
               Mahmûd, a youth of about twenty, who partook of his father's insensibility and
                  coolness, and who, moreover, had a great deal of dry humor and ready wit, looked
                  upon the incident in the light of a good joke, and broke out into a hearty laugh
                  when he saw the ugly picture which the grinning head made, set in its earthen
                  frame.
               "Let us pop it into the shop of Kior Ali, the barber opposite," said the youth:
                  "he is just beginning to open it; and as he has but one eye, we shall be better
                  able to do so without being seen. Do, father," said Mahmûd, "let me; nobody shall
                  discover me; and let it be done before there is more daylight."
               The father consented; and Mahmûd, catching the moment when the barber had walked
                  to the corner of the street to perform certain ablutions, stepped into his shop,
                  and placed the head on a sort of takcheh, or
                  bracket on the wall, arranged some shaving towels about it, as if it had been a
                  customer ready seated to be shaved, and, with a boy's mischief in his heart,
                  stepped back to his oven again, to watch the effects which this new sort of
                  customer would have upon the blind barber.
               Kior Ali hobbled into his shop, which was but ill lighted by a glimmering of
                  daylight, that hardly pierced through the oil-papered windows, and, looking about
                  him, saw this figure, as he supposed, seated against the wall, ready to be
                  operated upon.
               "Ha! peace be unto you!" said he to it; "you are rather early this morning; I did
                  not see you at first. My water is not yet hot. Oh! I see you want your head
                  shaved; but why do you take off your fese
                  (skull-cap) so soon? you will catch cold." Then he paused. "No answer," said the barber to himself. "I suppose he
                  is dumb, and deaf too, perhaps. Well, I am half blind, so we are nearly upon equal
                  terms; however, if I were even to lose my other eye," addressing himself to the
                  head, "I dare say, my old uncle, I could shave you for all that; for my razor
                  would glide as naturally over your head, as a draught of good wine does over my
                  throat."
               He went methodically about his preparations; he took down his tin basin from a
                  peg, prepared his soap, then stropped his razor on the long bit of leather that
                  was fastened to his girdle. Having made his lather, he walked up to the supposed
                  customer, holding the basin in his left hand, whilst his right was extended to
                  sprinkle the first preparation of water on the sconce. No sooner had he placed his
                  hand on the cold head, than he withdrew it as if he had been burnt. "Eh! why,
                  what's the matter with you, friend?" said the barber; "you are as cold as a piece
                  of ice." But when he attempted a second time to lather it, down it came with a
                  terrible bounce from the shelf to the floor, and made the poor shaver jump quite
                  across his shop with the fright.
               "Aman! aman! O mercy! mercy!" cried Kior Ali, as he thrust himself into the
                  furthermost corner without daring to move. "Take my shop, my razors, my
                  towels—take all I have; but don't touch my life! If you are the Shaitan, speak; but excuse my shaving you!"
               But when he found that all was hushed after the catastrophe, and that nothing was
                  to be feared, he approached the head, and taking it up by the lock of hair at the
                  top, he looked at it in amazement. "A head, by all the imams!" said he, accosting
                  it; "and how did you get here? Do you want to disgrace me, you filthy piece of
                  flesh? but you shall not! Although Kior Ali has lost one eye, yet his other is a
                  sharp one, and knows what it is about. I would give you to the baker Hassan there,
                  if his rogue of a son, who is now looking this way, was not even sharper than this
                  self-same eye; but now I think of it, I will take you where you can do no harm.
                  The Giaour Yanaki, the Greek kabobchi
                  *
                   (roast-meat man), shall have you, and shall cut you up into mincemeat for
                  his infidel customers." Upon this, Kior Ali, drawing in one hand, in which he
                  carried the head, through the slit on the sides of his beniche, or cloak, and taking up his pipe in the other, walked down
                     two streets to the shop of the aforesaid Greek.
               
                  *The kabob shops at Constantinople are
                     eating-houses, where, at a moment's notice, a dish of roast meat, and small
                     bits of meat done on skewers, are served up to whoever asks for them.
               
               He frequented it in preference to that of a Mussulman, because he could here drink
                  wine with impunity. From long practice, he knew precisely where the provision of
                  fresh meat was kept; and, as he entered the shop, casting his eye furtively round,
                  he threw the head in a dark corner, behind one of the large sides of a sheep that
                  was to be used for the kabobs of the day. No one saw him perform this feat; for
                  the morning was still sufficiently obscure to screen him. He lighted his pipe at
                  Yanaki's charcoal fire, and, as a pretext for his visit, ordered a dish of meat to
                  be sent to him for breakfast; a treat to which he thought himself fully entitled
                  after his morning's adventure.
               Yanaki, meanwhile, having cleaned his platters, put his skewers in order, lit his
                  fires, made his sherbets, and swept out his shop, went to the larder for some meat
                  for the shaver's breakfast. Yanaki was a true Greek—cunning, cautious, deceitful;
                  cringing to his superiors, tyrannical towards his inferiors; detesting with a
                  mortal hatred his proud masters, the Osmanlies, yet fawning, flattering, and abject, whenever any of them, however low
                  in life, deigned to take notice of him. Turning over his stock, he looked about
                  for some old bits that might serve the present purpose, muttering to himself that
                  any carrion was good enough for a Turk's stomach. He surveyed his half sheep from
                  top to bottom; felt it, and said, "No, this will keep;" but as he turned up its
                  fat tail, the eye of the dead man's head caught his eye, and made him start, and
                  step back some paces. "As ye love your eyes," exclaimed he, "who is there?"
                  Receiving no answer, he looked again and again; then nearer—then, thrusting his
                  hand among sheep's heads and trotters, old remnants of meat, and the like, he
                  pulled out the head—the horrid head—which he held extended at arm's length, as if
                  he were afraid that it would do him mischief. "Anathemas attend your beard!"
                  exclaimed Yanaki, as soon as he discovered, by the tuft of hair on the top, that
                  it had belonged to a Mussulman. "Och! if I had but every one of your heads in this
                  manner, ye cursed race of Omar! I would make kabobs of them, and every cur in
                  Constantinople should get fat for nothing. May ye all come to this end! May the
                  vultures feed on your car-cases! and may every Greek have the good fortune which
                  has befallen me this day, of having one of your worthless skulls for his
                  football!" Upon which, in his rage, he threw it down and kicked it from him; but,
                  recollecting himself, he said, "But after all, what shall I do with it? If it is
                  seen here, I am lost for ever: nobody will believe but what I have killed a
                  Turk."
               All of a sudden he cried out, in a sort of malicious ecstasy, "'Tis well I
                  remembered—the Jew! the Jew!—a properer place for such a head was never thought or
                  heard of; and there you shall go, thou vile remnant of a Mahomedan!"
               Upon which he seized it, and, hiding it under his coat, ran with it down the
                  street to where the dead body of a Jew lay extended, with its head placed
                  immediately between its legs.
               In Turkey, when a Mahomedan is beheaded, his head is placed under his arm, by way
                  of an honorable distinction from the Christian or Jew, who, when a similar
                  misfortune befalls them, have theirs inserted between their legs, as close to the
                  seat of dishonor as possible.
               It was in that situation, then, that Yanaki placed the Turk's head, putting it as
                  near, cheek by jowl, with the Jew's as the hurry of the case would allow. He had
                  been able to effect this without being seen, because the day was still but little
                  advanced, and no one stirring; and he returned to his shop, full of exultation at
                  having been able to discharge his feelings of hatred against his oppressors, by
                  placing one of their heads on the spot in nature, which, according to his
                  estimation, was the most teeming with opprobrium.
               The unfortunate sufferer on this occasion had been accused of stealing and putting
                  to death a Mahomedan child (a ceremony in their religion which they have been
                  known to practise both in Turkey and Persia), and which created such an
                  extraordinary tumult among the mob of Constantinople, that, in order to appease
                  it, he had been decapitated. His execution had taken place purposely before the
                  door of a wealthy Greek, and the body was ordered to remain there three days
                  before it was permitted to be carried away for interment. The expectation that the
                  Greek would be induced to pay down a handsome sum, in order that this nuisance
                  might be removed from his door, and save him from the ill luck which such an
                  object is generally supposed to bring, made the officer intrusted with the
                  execution prefer this spot to every other. But, careless of the consequences, the
                  Greek shut up the windows of his house,
                  determined to deprive his oppressors of their expected perquisite; and so the dead
                  Jew remained exposed his full time. Few excepting those of the true faith ventured
                  to approach the spot, fearful that the Mahomedan authorities would, in their
                  wanton propensities to heap insults upon the Giaours, oblige some one of them to
                  carry the carcase to the place of burial; and thus the horrid and disgusting
                  object was left abandoned to itself, and this had given an opportunity to the
                  kabobchi, Yanaki, to dispose of the head in the manner above related, unseen and
                  unmolested. But when, as the day advanced, and as the stir of the streets became
                  more active, this additional head was discovered, the crowd which gathered about
                  it became immense. It was immediately rumored that a miracle had been performed;
                  for a dead Jew was to be seen with two heads. The extraordinary intelligence flew
                  from mouth to mouth, until the whole city was in an uproar, and all were running
                  to see the miracle. The Sanhedrim immediately pronounced that something
                  extraordinary was about to happen to their persecuted race. Rabbins were to be
                  seen running to and fro, and their whole community was now poured around the dead
                  body, in expectation that he would perhaps arise, put on his heads, and deliver
                  them from the gripe of their oppressors.
               But as ill luck would have it for them, a Janissary, who had mixed in the crowd,
                  and had taken a close survey of the supernumerary head, exclaimed, in a mixture of
                  doubt and amazement, "Allah, Allah, il Allah! these are no infidels' heads. One is
                  the head of our lord and master, the Aga of the Janissaries." Upon which, seeing
                  more of his companions, he called them to him, and making known his discovery,
                  they became violent with rage, and set off to communicate the intelligence to
                  their Orta.
               The news spread like wildfire throughout the whole of the corps of the
                  Janissaries, and a most alarming tumult was immediately excited; for it seems that
                  it was unknown in the capital that their chief, to whom they were devotedly
                  attached, and one of their own selection, had been put to death.
               "What!" said they, "is it not enough to deal thus treacherously with us, and
                  deprive us of a chief to whom we are attached; but we must be treated with the
                  greatest contempt that it is possible for men to receive? What! the head of our
                  most noble Aga of the Janissaries to be placed upon the most ignoble part of a
                  Jew! what are we come to? We alone are not insulted; the whole of Islam is
                  insulted, degraded, debased. No. This is unheard of insolence, a stain never to be
                  wiped off, without the extermination of the whole race. And what dog has done this
                  deed? How did the head get there? Is it that dog of a Vizier's work, or have the
                  Reis Effendi and those traitors of Frank ambassadors been at work?—Wallah, Billah, Tallah! by the holy Caaba, by the
                  beard of Osman, and by the sword of Omar, we will be revenged!"
               We must leave the tumult to rage for a short time; we must request the reader to
                  imagine a scene, in which Jews are flying in all directions, hiding themselves
                  with great precaution against enraged Turks, who, with expressions like those just
                  mentioned in their mouths, are to be seen walking about in groups, armed to their
                  teeth with pistols and cimeters, and vowing vengeance upon everything which came
                  in their way. He must imagine a city of narrow streets and low houses, thronged
                  with a numerous population, in dresses the most various in shape and the most
                  lively in colors, all anxious, all talking, all agog as if something extraordinary
                  was to happen; in the midst of whom I will leave him, to take a look into the
                  interior of the sultan's seraglio, and to
                  inquire in what his eminency himself had been engaged since we last noticed
                  him.
               On the very same night of the tailor's attendance, the sultan had given a secret
                  order for taking off the head of the aga of the Janissaries (the fomenter of all
                  the disturbances which had lately taken place among his corps, and consequently
                  their idol); and so anxious was he about its execution, that he had ordered it to
                  be brought to him the moment it was off. The man intrusted with the execution,
                  upon entering the room where he had been directed to bring the head, seeing some
                  one seated, naturally took him for the sultan, and, without daring to look up, he
                  immediately placed the burden at his feet, with the prostrations which we have
                  already described as having been performed before the tailor. The sultan, who not
                  a minute before had taken away the bundle containing the dervish's dress, had done
                  so in the intention of deceiving his slave Mansouri himself—so desirous was he of
                  being unknown in his new disguise even to him—and intended to have substituted
                  another in its stead; but not calculating either upon the reception of the head,
                  or upon Mansouri's immediate return to the tailor, he was himself completely
                  puzzled how to act when he found the tailor was gone, led off by his slave. To
                  have sent after them would have disconcerted his schemes, and therefore he felt
                  himself obliged to await Mansouri's return, before he could get an explanation of
                  what had happened; for he knew that they would not have gone away without the
                  dress, and that dress he had then in his possession. In the meanwhile, anxious and
                  impatient to know what had become of the expected head, he sent for the officer
                  who was intrusted with the execution; and the astonishment of both may be imagined
                  when an explanation took place.
               "By my beard," exclaimed the sultan, having thought awhile within himself; "by my
                  beard, the tailor must have got the head!"
               His impatience for Mansouri's return then became extreme. In vain he fretted,
                  fumed, and cried, "Allah! Allah!" It did not make the slave return a minute the
                  sooner, who, good man, would have gone quietly to rest had he not been called upon
                  to appear before the sultan.
               As soon as he was within hearing, he called out, "Ahi! Mansouri, run immediately
                  to the tailor—he has got the head of the aga of the Janissaries instead of the
                  dervish's dress—run, fetch it without loss of time, or something unfortunate will
                  happen!" He then explained how this untoward event had occurred. Mansouri now, in
                  his turn, felt himself greatly embarrassed; for he only knew the road to the
                  tailor's stall, but was totally unacquainted with his dwelling-house. However,
                  rather than excite his master's anxiety in a higher degree, he set off in quest of
                  the tailor, and went straight to his stall, in the hopes of hearing from the
                  neighbors where his house was. It was too early in the day for the opening of the
                  Bezestan, and except a coffee-house that had just prepared for the reception of
                  customers, where he applied and could gain no intelligence, he found himself
                  completely at a stand-still. By the greatest good luck, he recollected Babadul had
                  told him that he was the muezzin to the little mosque in the Fish Market, and
                  thither he immediately bent his steps. The azan, or morning invitation to prayers,
                  was now chanting forth from all the minarets, and he expected that he might catch
                  the purloiner of the head in the very act of inviting the faithful to prayers.
               As he approached the spot, he heard an old broken and tremulous voice, which he
                  imagined might be Babadul's, breaking the stillness of the morning by all the
                  energy of his lungs; and he was not mistaken, for as he stood under the minaret, he perceived the old man walking round
                  the gallery which encircles it, with his hand applied to the back of his ear, and
                  with his mouth wide open, pouring out his whole throat in the execution of his
                  office. As soon as the tailor saw Mansouri making signs to him, the profession of
                  faith stuck in his throat; and between the fright of being brought to account for
                  the head, and the words which he had to pronounce, it is said that he made so
                  strange a jumble, that some of the stricter Mussulmans, his neighbors, who were
                  paying attention to the call, professed themselves quite scandalized at his
                  performance. He descended with all haste, and locking the door after him which
                  leads up the winding staircase, he met Mansouri in the street. He did not wait to
                  be questioned respecting the fate of the horrid object, but at once attacked the
                  slave concerning the trick, as he called it, which had been put upon him.
               "Are you a man," said he, "to treat a poor emir like me in the manner you have
                  done, as if my house was a charnel-house? I suppose you will ask me the price of
                  blood next?"
               "Friend," said Mansouri, "what are you talking about? do not you see that it has
                  been a mistake?"
               "A mistake, indeed!" cried the tailor, "a mistake done on purpose to bring a poor
                  man into trouble. One man laughs at my stupid beard, and makes me believe that I
                  am to make a suit of clothes for him—another takes away the pattern—and a third
                  substitutes a dead man's head for it. Allah! Allah! I have got into the hands of a
                  pretty nest of rogues, a set of ill-begotten knaves!"
               Upon which Mansouri placed his hand upon the tailor's mouth, and said, "Say no
                  more, say no more; you are getting deeper into the dirt. Do you know whom you are
                  abusing?"
               "I know not, nor care not," answered Babadul; "all I know is, that whoever gives
                  me a dead man's head for a suit of clothes can only be an infidel dog."
               "Do you call God's vicegerent upon earth, you old demi-stitching, demi-praying
                  fool, an infidel dog?" exclaimed Mansouri in a rage, which entirely made him
                  forget the precaution he had hitherto maintained concerning his employer. "Are
                  your vile lips to defile the name of him who is the Alem
                     penah, the refuge of the world? What dirt are you eating, what ashes
                  are you heaping on your head? Come, no more words; tell me where the dead man's
                  head is, or I will take yours off in his stead."
               Upon hearing this, the tailor stood with his mouth wide open, as if the doors of
                  his understanding had just been unlocked.
               "Aman, aman, mercy, mercy, O aga!" cried Babadul
                  to Mansouri, "I was ignorant of what I was saying. Who would have thought it? Ass,
                  fool, dolt, that I am, not to have known better. Bismillah! in the name of the Prophet, pray come to my house; your
                  steps will be fortunate, and your slave's head will touch the stars."
               "I am in a hurry, a great hurry," said Mansouri. "Where is the head, the head of
                  the aga of the Janissaries?"
               When the tailor heard whose head it had been, and recollected what he and his wife
                  had done with it, his knees knocked under him with fear, and he began to exude
                  from every pore.
               "Where is it, indeed?" said he. "Oh! what has come upon us! Oh! what cursed
                     kismet (fate) is this?"
               "Where is it?" exclaimed the slave, again and again, "where is it? speak
                  quick!"
               The poor tailor was completely puzzled what to say, and kept floundering from one answer to another
                  until he was quite entangled as in a net.
               "Have you burnt it?"
               "No."
               "Have you thrown it away?"
               "No."
               "Then, in the name of the Prophet, what have you done with it? Have you eat
                  it?"
               "No."
               "Is it lying in your house?"
               "No."
               "Is it hiding in any other person's house?"
               "No."
               Then at last, quite out of patience, the slave Mansouri took Babadul by his beard,
                  and shaking his head for him, exclaimed with a roar, "Then tell me, you old
                  dotard! what is it doing?"
               "It is baking," answered the tailor, half choked. "I have said it."
               "Baking! did you say?" exclaimed the slave, in the greatest amazement; "what did
                  you bake it for? Are you going to eat it?"
               "True, I said; what would you have more?" answered Babadul, "it is now baking."
                  And then he gave a full account of what he and his wife had done in the sad
                  dilemma in which they had been placed.
               "Show me the way to the baker's," said Mansouri; "at least we shall get it in its
                  singed state, if we can get it in no other. Who ever thought of baking the head of
                  the aga of the Janissaries? Allah il Allah!"
               They then proceeded to the baker Hassan's, who was now about taking his bread from
                  his oven. As soon as he became acquainted with their errand, he did not hesitate
                  in telling all the circumstances attending the transmission of the head from the
                  pipkin to the barber's bracket; happy to have had an opportunity of exculpating
                  himself of what might possibly have been brought up against him as a crime.
               The three (Mansouri, the tailor, and the baker) then proceeded to the barber's,
                  and inquired from him what he had done with the head of his earliest customer.
               Kior Ali, after some hesitation, made great assurances that he looked upon this
                  horrid object as a donation from Eblis himself, and consequently that he had
                  thought himself justified in transferring it over to the Giaour Yanaki, who, he
                  made no doubt, had already made his brother infidels partake of it in the shape of
                  kabobs. Full of wonder and amazement, invoking the Prophet at each step, and
                  uncertain as to the result of such unheard-of adventures, they then added the
                  barber to their party, and proceeded to Yanaki's cook-shop.
               The Greek, confounded at seeing so many of the true believers enter his house, had
                  a sort of feeling that their business was not of roast meat, but that they were in
                  search of meat of a less savory nature. As soon as the question had been put to
                  him concerning the head, he stoutly denied having seen it, or knowing anything at
                  all concerning it.
               The barber showed the spot where he had placed it, and swore it upon the
                  Koran.
               Mansouri had undertaken the investigation of the point in question, when they
                  discovered symptoms of the extraordinary agitation that prevailed in the city in
                  consequence of the discovery which had been made of the double-headed Jew, and of
                  the subsequent discovery that had produced such great sensation among the whole
                  corps of Janissaries.
               Mansouri, followed by the tailor, the baker, and the barber, then proceeded to the spot where the dead
                  Israelite was prostrate; and there, to their astonishment, they each recognised
                  their morning visitor—the head so long sought after.
               Yanaki, the Greek, in the meanwhile, conscious of what was likely to befall him,
                  without loss of time gathered what money he had ready at hand, and fled the
                  city.
               "Where is the Greek?" said Mansouri, turning round to look for him, in the
                  supposition that he had joined his party; "we must all go before the sultan."
               "I dare say he is run off," said the barber. "I am not so blind but I can see that
                  he it is who gifted the Jew with his additional head."
               Mansouri now would have carried off the head; but, surrounded as it was by a band
                  of enraged and armed soldiers, who vowed vengeance upon him who had deprived them
                  of their chief, he thought it most prudent to withdraw. Leading with him his three
                  witnesses, he at once proceeded to the presence of his master.
               When Mansouri had informed the sultan of all that had happened, where he had found
                  the head of the aga of the Janissaries, how it had got there, and of the tumult it
                  had raised, the reader may better imagine than I can describe the state of the
                  monarch's mind. To tell the story with all its particulars he felt would be
                  derogatory to his dignity, for it was sure to cover him with ridicule; but at the
                  same time to let the matter rest as it now stood was impossible, because the
                  tumult would increase until there would be no means of quelling it, and the affair
                  might terminate by depriving him of his crown, together with his life.
               He remained in a state of indecision for some time, twisting up the ends of his
                  mustachios, and muttering "Allah! Allah!" in low ejaculations, until at length he
                  ordered the prime vizier and the mûfti to his presence.
               Alarmed by the abruptness, of the summons, these two great dignitaries arrived at
                  the imperial gate in no enviable state of mind; but when the sultan had informed
                  them of the tumult then raging in the capital, they resumed their usual
                  tranquillity.
               After some deliberation it was resolved, that the tailor, the baker, the barber,
                  and the kabobchi, should appear before the tribunal of the mûfti, accused of
                  having entered into a conspiracy against the aga of the Janissaries, and stealing
                  his head, for the purposes of baking, shaving, and roasting it, and that they
                  should be condemned to pay the price of his blood; but as the kabobchi had been
                  the immediate cause of the tumult by treating the head with such gross and
                  unheard-of insult, and as he was a Greek and an infidel, it was further resolved
                  that the mûfti should issue a fetwah,
                  authorizing his head to be cut off, and placed on the same odious spot where he
                  had exposed that of the aga of the Janissaries.
               It was then agreed between the sultan and his grand vizier, that, in order to
                  appease the Janissaries, a new aga should be appointed who was agreeable to them,
                  and that the deceased should be buried with becoming distinction. All this (except
                  killing the Greek, who had fled) was done, and tranquillity again restored to the
                  city. But it must further be added, to the honor of the sultan, that he not only
                  paid every expense which the tailor, the baker, and the barber were condemned to
                  incur, but also gave them each a handsome reward, for the difficulties into which
                  they had so unfortunately been thrown.
            
            
               
               The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing.
               CLEMATIS Cottage, in the suburbs of a little market-town, which we, for many and
                  good reasons, shall call Brackenbury, acknowledging it to be an alias for its real
                  name, had been vacant many months. The Brackenbury Journal profited thereby; for
                  every week there appeared in its front page an advertisement headed "Delightful
                  Abode" in capital letters, and assuring anybody and everybody who wished to enjoy
                  life in a cottage at a "low figure," that Clematis Cottage was the ne plus ultra of small convenient houses. It was
                  pleasantly situated in its own grounds, consisting of a quarter of an acre laid
                  out in the most scientific manner. It was detached from all other houses, but was
                  conveniently situated near to an inn, where good accommodation was offered to man
                  and beast, and where there was a good ordinary provided every Sunday at two
                  o'clock. Moreover, it had the most desirable of all desirables, a pump of
                  excellent water.
               The Brackenburyans in general, like the landlord of Clematis Cottage in
                  particular, were surprised that no one answered this enticing advertisement. Was
                  the world blind? or was the circulation of the Brackenbury Journal too limited?
                  The owner of the desirable premises thought it was possible; so, without
                  apologizing to the editor, he spent "seven bob," as he called seven shillings, on
                  an advertisement in the "Times."
               The first advertisement brought several applicants, but as the owner of the
                  cottage, Mr. Punks, asked the extravagant rent of forty pounds a year, nobody
                  would take it. Mr. Punks then sent to the Times a "pious" advertisement, to see if
                  better luck would attend that plan. The pious advertisement appeared, and Punks
                  read it to his wife, as follows.
               
                  "TO PIOUS PEOPLE.—In Brackenbury the pure Word is preached. A seat in the
                     Ebenezer Chapel may be procured, and a comfortable cottage, within five
                     minutes' walk of it, rented at a moderate price, by applying to Percival Punks,
                     deacon of the said chapel."
               
               "What do you think of that, marm?" asked Punks of his wife.
               "No go," said the lady. "Seven shillings thrown away."
               "You'll see, marm, you'll see," said Punks. "Keep an eye on the shop. I'll return
                  the paper and be off to the railway."
               "I think there may be something in it, after all," said Mrs. Punks, musingly.
                  "There is nothing like gammon in this world. How would Spiffen & Co. have
                  avoided bankruptcy if they had not sold three-shilling blankets for five shillings
                  each for the use of the poor slaves in the West Indies? We never did much
                  ourselves till we gave up—that is, pretended to give up—slave-grown sugars. Punks,
                  you are right for once. Gammon for ever!"
               So much was the mind of the groceress engaged in speculating culating on the result of her husband's ingenuity,
                  that she inadvertently committed many grievous errors during the day. She supplied
                  her customers with common congou at three-and-nine for the best gunpowder at
                  six-and-three, and substituted coarse lump at ten-and-a-half, for best loaf at
                  thirteen-and-a-farthing—all her errors were fortunately on the right side for
                  her.
               While his wife was giving way to this profitable state of mental aberration, Punks
                  was walking up and down the platform of the Brackenbury station, waiting the
                  arrival of the down trains. He eagerly inspected every one that got out, but
                  without success. He knew all the arrivals to be inhabitants of the town or its
                  neighborhood, and was aware that all of them were suited with houses.
               At last the five o'clock train arrived at twenty-five minutes and a half past that
                  hour. From a first-class carriage alighted a middle-aged gentlemen, who was
                  followed by a middle-aged lady. They were both of them modestly attired in dark
                  suits, plainly made up, but of the best materials. As the gentleman drew out his
                  silk-handkerchief from his pocket, he drew out with it sundry bits of printed
                  paper, which fluttered about the platform in all directions.
               Punks picked up one that fell at his feet, and saw that it was a religious
                  tract.
               "That's my man," said Punks. "I'm off home to receive him; has he brought any
                  luggage, I wonder?"
               He saw two very large portmanteaus extracted from the luggage-van, and deposited
                  at the feet of the pious pair, and ran off home.
               "All right," said Punks, as he entered his back parlor. "They'll be here in a
                  minute."
               "Who'll be here in a minute?" inquired Mrs. Punks.
               "My new tenants—as nice a pair of pious, middle-aged ones as you ever set eyes on.
                  Give me a clean cravat and my best coat," said Punks.
               "Have you told them the rent?" asked his wife.
               "I haven't spoke to them," said Punks, undressing himself as far as his coat and
                  neckcloth went.
               "How do you know, then, that they are coming about the cottage?" asked his
                  wife.
               "By instinct—but you'll see. Shall I do? Do I look like a deacon, eh?" said
                  Punks.
               "Comb your hair down, straighten and tuck in your shirt-collar—there, that will
                  do. Bless me, here are a gentleman and lady, nice, solid-looking people, crossing
                  the road to our door," said Mrs. Punks.
               "Show them in here," said Punks, sitting down before a monthly Missionaries'
                  Magazine, and pretending to be deep in its contents.
               "If you can spare the time, my dear," said Mrs. Punks, "a lady and gentleman wish
                  to speak to you."
               "I am busy, very busy in spiritual matters, but if they cannot call to-morrow or
                  next week, I will lay aside my occupations, and hear what they have to say," said
                  Punks in awfully solemn tones.
               "They are come about the cottage, my dear," said Mrs. Punks, still holding the
                  little parlor door in her hand, and having her applicants close to her elbow.
               "Cottage?—what cottage?" said Punks.
               "Clematis Cottage, I suppose," replied his wife.
               "Dear, dear, oh, dear!" groaned Punks, "the number of applications that I have had
                  for that sweet little spot! really it is very tiresome—but admit them."
               The gentleman and lady entered the little back-parlor, and took the chairs to
                  which Punks pointed.
               "I am here," said the gentleman, "in consequence of an—"
               
               "Advertisement in the Times, you would say. I am really very sorry you did not
                  make an earlier application," said Punks.
               "Why, I came down the moment I read it in the papers," said the man.
               "Four trains in before you came," said Punks. "Not less than forty or fifty
                  applicants for Clematis Cottage in each of them."
               "Is it let then?" inquired the lady.
               "Why, not exactly let, marm; references of respectability required, you know, and
                  all that sort of thing—but the beauty and conveniency of the spot, and——"
               "We do not care for them, sir," said the gentleman, solemnly. "Its approximation
                  to a place of worship, where the pure word can be heard, was our chief inducement
                  to come down and visit it."
               "The rent is really very moderate," said Punks, "and the water remarkably
                  salubrious."
               "Could we see the premises?" asked the lady.
               "Undoubtedly, marm; wearied as I am with walking over it so often to-day, I will
                  show it to you myself," said Punks.
               "Perhaps you would allow us to deposit our trunks in your warehouse," said the
                  gentleman. "If the cottage should suit us, and you are inclined to accept us as
                  your tenants, we should much like to take possession of it at once."
               "But furniture, my dear sir?"
               "You have tradesmen—upholsterers in Brackenbury, I presume."
               "Lots," said Punks.
               "And of the right way of thinking?" asked the lady.
               "Independents to the back-bone, who submit to have their goods seized rather than
                  pay a church-rate," said Punks.
               "Worthy men," said the gentleman; "lead on, sir."
               Punks led the way, and made many pious remarks as they walked along. He was
                  delighted at the reception which his remarks met with from his hearers, and after
                  expatiating on the merits of the preacher at Ebenezer, which he pointed out to
                  them as he passed it, he proceeded to launch out in praise of the cottage to
                  let.
               "There's a room for a hymn, marm," said he, letting them into the little
                  front-parlor. "There's a something holy in the very echo!"
               "Nice little place enough," said the lady, "and the floor very clean considering
                  the number of people that have inspected it, and that there is no door-mats and a
                  very bad scraper."
               "A-humph!" coughed Punks, for he did not know what to say, and so pretended that
                  he did not hear the remark.
               "A very retired and very pleasant spot, suited to sober meditation. What say you,
                  Martha? will it do?" said the gentleman.
               "It wants a deal of repair," said the lady.
               "Consider the rent, marm! only sixty pounds a year, and within five minutes' walk
                  of Ebenezer, where the pure word is preached, and a seat secured," said Punks.
               "Say fifty," said the gentleman.
               Punks shook his head negatively.
               "That is too much by twenty pounds," said the lady. "Let us look a little
                  further."
               "Make it guineas and it's yours," said Punks, "provided the references are
                  satisfactory."
               The gentleman and lady talked together for a few minutes, during which Punks was
                  trying to appear cool and unconcerned, though in reality he was in a state of
                  nervous agitation, difficult to be disguised.
               
               "We think it very highly rented," said the gentleman, "but as money is no object
                  to us——"
               "I wish I had stuck to sixty," said Punks to himself.
               "And in consideration of the blessed advantages attached to it——"
               "Pump of splendid water!" said Punks aloud.
               "And of obtaining immediate possession of it, we will close with you. Here is my
                  card."
               "Ahem!—Mr. Jabez Worthington—good name," said Punks. "Alderbury—respectable place.
                  Name your friend."
               "The firm, sir, of which I am senior partner; Worthington, Dubs, and
                  Trumps—general agents—call there and ask for Trumps, and if he don't satisfy you
                  of my respectability, nobody else can do it," said Mr. Worthington.
               "That'll do—up by train to-morrow. Meanwhile, what will you do?" said Punks.
               "Put up at the inn," said Mrs. Worthington.
               "No, no; good accommodations for man and horse, but not for a respectable married
                  couple. Our first floor is now to let, and is unoccupied. You shall have it till
                  the cottage is furnished. Ten shillings a day, maid and cooking included, won't
                  hurt you," said Punks, always on the lookout for a chance.
               "We are deeply indebted to you, sir," said Mrs. Worthington.
               "Now, marm, now, sir, we will return and put you in possession of your snug little
                  apartments," said Punks, as he locked the door of Clematis Cottage, put the key in
                  his pocket, and led the way to his shop.
               As the rooms were quite ready, Mr. and Mrs. Worthington walked into them at once,
                  and desired that their luggage—merely the few things that they had brought down
                  with them for a change or two—might be carried upstairs.
               The heavy porter and shop-boy were set to work to effect their removal, but the
                  trunks were so heavy, they could scarcely accomplish their task.
               "Supper, marm?" said Punks, his civility greatly increased by the report of the
                  weight of the trunks.
               "A little tea, if you please," said Mr. Worthington. "We trust you have family
                  devotions and will allow us to join in them."
               "Delightful people!" said Punks to his wife. "But I wish I had held out for sixty.
                  I have no doubt they would have given it, they appear to be so very rich, and
                  so—so—simple."
               "Seen their money? got any trinkets, rings, watches, or jewels, and that sort of
                  things?" said Mrs. Punks.
               "Why, really, when you come to ask—no," said Punks; "but they look like it, eh?
                  don't they?"
               "I'll take up the tea-things myself," said Mrs. Punks, looking very mysteriously.
                  Her husband sat deeply and anxiously involved in thought till her return.
               "Well—how? what do you think?"
               "All right," said Mrs. Punks, smoothing her black silk apron. "The man has got a
                  gold repeater as large as a cheese-plate, and the woman a pretty little Geneva
                  fastened to a long gold chain, and her hands are positively covered with
                  rings."
               Punks rubbed his hands with delight, and sent the porter out to the expounder of
                  the Ebenezer, and begged him to come down to be introduced to the new occupant of
                  Clematis Cottage, who would doubtless be a liberal contributor to the chapel, and
                  sundry charities attached thereto.
               It is needless to say the call was obeyed. The evening was passed in a most
                  orderly manner. The pastor was delighted with the new addition to his flock, and
                  Punks was so taken with the sobriety of their manners, and their attention tion to the exercises of the evening,
                  that he had made up his mind not to go to town to question their referee, but to
                  be content with their evident respectability.
               Mrs. Punks, however, was a cautious woman, and insisted upon the interview with
                  Trumps; she, moreover, bade him ask a few questions about the respectability of
                  the firm in general; "for," as she observed, "piety is all very well, but pay is
                  better."
               Punks was annoyed at her suspicions, and took a little hot rum-and-water with the
                  pastor to quiet his nerves.
               Punks was up early and off to London by the first train, and at ten o'clock
                  presented himself at the place of reference.
               "Mr. Trumps at home?" said Punks.
               "I am Mr. Trumps, sir, pray walk in. Now what can we do for you?" said a sleek
                  man, throwing open an overgrown ledger, clad in parchment, with green cuffs and
                  collar.
               "I am referred to you, sir, for the respectability and the responsibility of Mr.
                  Worthington," said Punks.
               "Eh? oh, I know—Clematis Cottage—how does my respected friend like it?" asked
                  Trumps.
               "So much that he has hired it," said Punks; "that is, if references are all
                  right."
               "Right, sir? Isn't he at the head of this firm, sir? Don't take my word for his
                  respectability—go upon Change—inquire in Mark-lane—ask at the India-House—merely
                  whisper his name at Lloyd's, that's all. Worthington respectable and responsible?
                  it's a d—d deal too good!" said Trumps, as he laughed triumphantly.
               "He seems to be a pious man, and punctual in his payments," said Punks, "and his
                  wife is—"
               "An angel, sir!—not fit to live upon this earth, sir. Go to Clapham and ask—but
                  you need not ask—there is not a benefaction board attached to any chapel or infant
                  school, that does not bear upon its black surface the name of Dorothea
                  Worthington, engraved in gold characters, with a magnificent donation attached to
                  it," said Trumps.
               "Dorothea? I thought he called her Martha," said Punks.
               "For brevity's sake, sir, merely for brevity's sake," replied Trumps. "You are a
                  lucky man, Mr. What's-your-name."
               "You think I'm safe, then?" asked Punks.
               "Shall I give you a check for a twelvemonth's rent in advance?" said Trumps,
                  opening a desk, and taking out a long, slim book.
               "Oh, dear, no; no occasion for that," said Punks.
               "Well, my dear sir, can I do anything more for you? Sorry to hurry you, but
                  business, you know, must be attended to. Good bye—remember me to Worthington and
                  his angelic wife," said Trumps, as he bowed Punks out of his office.
               As Punks returned home in a third-class carriage, there was one thing that rather
                  puzzled him—how was it for so old a firm—a firm that had existed ever since the
                  waiter at the coffee-house had administered to the comforts of its customers—the
                  furniture of the office should be so remarkably new? He had almost made up his
                  mind to return and ask the question, when the idea occurred to him that the old
                  was worn out by excessive use, and had just been replaced.
               "Well, my dear, is it all right?" whispered Mrs. Punks to her husband, when he had
                  gained the little back parlor.
               "Right, marm? yes, I should think it was, too—a great deal more than right. We are
                  highly favored, marm," said Punks; "two such angelic people are not be found every
                  day, I can tell you."
               "Tell me all about them," said the groceress.
               
               Punks tried to do so, but, to his own surprise, was obliged to draw largely upon
                  his inventive faculties; for, when he summed up in his brain all the evidence he
                  had collected, it only amounted to this—that Worthington was a partner in a
                  general agent's office, and that his wife was an angel, as far as being a liberal
                  patroness to the chapels and charities at Clapham went—upon the ipse dixit of the junior partner, Mr. Trumps. This was
                  a pretty strong peg, however, to hang a story upon, and Punks availed himself of
                  it. His imagination was fertile, and Mrs. Punks was satisfied; especially when she
                  heard that Trumps had tendered a cheque for a twelvemonth's rent in advance;
                  though she could not help calling her husband a fool for not having taken it.
               "You are quite satisfied, I hope, Mr. Punks?" said Mrs. Worthington, as he entered
                  the front drawing-room.
               "More than satisfied, marm; delighted to have such worthy people as my tenants,"
                  replied Punks, quite overjoyed; for he saw a purse, a large, green, netted purse,
                  lying on the table, filled full of sovereigns.
               "Then we can take possession and furnish the cottage immediately," said Mr.
                  Worthington.
               "We had better remain here, my love, until the house is fit to receive us," said
                  Mrs. Worthington.
               "Oh! by all means. In the meanwhile, Mr. Punks will have the goodness, perhaps, to
                  introduce me to some respectable and pious tradesmen in Brackenbury, who will put
                  the place in order for us?" said Worthington.
               "Too happy, sir, too happy," said Punks.
               "You will take care, sir, not to introduce me to any tradesman of the wrong way of
                  thinking," said Mr. Worthington sternly.
               "Trust me for that—we hang together like—"
               "Trust! sir? I don't know the meaning of the word, as I told you before. I pay for
                  everything in ready money or by bill at two months, which is just the same," said
                  Mr. Worthington, as he put his hands into his breeches-pockets, and rattled sundry
                  coins about.
               "Just the same," said Punks, "if it's duly honored."
               "Shall I pay you in advance, sir?" asked Mrs. Worthington, angrily,
                  and proceeded to open the green netted purse. "If you have a doubt—"
               "Oh! dear me, marm, no—excuse me, pray excuse me, if I have offended you. I really
                  beg pardon," said Punks, in very humble tones.
               "It is granted, sir," said the lady; "but I must confess that I was very much hurt
                  to think that it was possible for a Worthington to dishonor a bill."
               "Say no more about it, my dear. Come with me, and Mr. Punks will kindly introduce
                  us to some good tradespeople," said Worthington.
               "And perhaps he will have the goodness to show us over the British school and the
                  Infant school? I am anxious to add my mite to the contributions of the
                  charitably-disposed," said Mrs. Worthington, as she dropped the heavy purse into
                  her reticule.
               "Angelic woman!" said Punks, just loudly enough to enable the lady to hear him, as
                  he led the way through the private passage into the town.
               The schools were duly inspected. The pious pair put down their names as annual
                  subscribers of ¥20 each, and gave the heads of each department a sovereign, to be
                  spent in tea and buns for their scholars.
               "What charming people! quite an acquisition to Brackenbury!" exclaimed the pious
                  ladies and gentlemen who visited the schools in the course of the morning.
               The report of the benevolent characters of the new tenants of Clematis Cottage was
                  spread like wild-fire, and before they reached the upholsterer's, to whom Punks
                     introduced duced them, that individual
                  was longing to have their custom. He shook Punks by the hand, whispered something
                  about a doshure, and undertook to furnish the cottage within two
                  days.
               "You will do it well, sir, and reasonably. Make a fair profit out of me, but don't
                  impose upon me. I shall examine your bill rigidly, for I pay for everything in
                  ready money, or by bill at two months," said Mr. Worthington, and so he said to
                  the ironmonger, the silversmith, the wine-merchant, and all other tradesmen, to
                  whom he gave most liberal orders.
               In the course of a week Clematis Cottage was elegantly furnished. Its cellars were
                  well stored, its larder supplied, and the new tenants, who had won golden opinions
                  of everybody of their own way of thinking, were only waiting to decide which of
                  the services of plate, sent in to them for inspection and approval, they should
                  purchase. It was a delicate question, and Worthington and his wife resolved, as
                  they told Mr. Punks, not to rely on their own judgment in so momentous a matter,
                  but to ask a few friends to a tea-party, and submit the different services to
                  their inspection, and take their opinions upon them.
               On the afternoon of the Saturday—the day on which the tea-party was
                  invited—Worthington and his lady, who had been visiting the poor, and liberally
                  supplying them with tracts, walked into Punks's shop. Punks and his wife were
                  already dressed for the party, and Mrs. Worthington paid the groceress many
                  compliments on the very becoming neatness of her dress. They were, of course,
                  asked into the little back-parlor, but Worthington declined the invitation, under
                  the plea that they must hurry home to be ready to receive their friends.
               "By the by," said Worthington, "have you any cash in the house, Mr. Punks?"
               Punks smirked, and confessed he had.
               "Then I will trouble you, sir," said Worthington, very sternly, "for change for
                  that check, 54l. 9s.. 10d., on Coutts and
                  Co. It is crossed regularly, as you will see."
               "Our outlay has been enormous—so many little things that one never dreams of—I
                  have not a sovereign left out of fifty or sixty—I forget exactly which—that I put
                  in my purse when I came down here," said Mrs. Worthington; "really our three or
                  four thousand a year, at this rate, will never do. We shall be ruined."
               "Oh, dear no, marm; not by no means—it's only the first outlay. When you are
                  settled down in Clematis Cottage, you'll live for a mere nothing—there's the
                  money, sir; five, four, nine, ten," said Punks; "you'll find it all right."
               "Excuse me, sir; but I am particular in money matters—I make it a rule to count
                  the change if it's only for a sixpence," said Mr. Worthington.
               "And very proper, too," said Mrs. Punks.
               "It is quite right, sir: you'll excuse my very great particularity—I know you
                  will—you are a man of business, Mr. Punks, and as such, will give me credit for
                  not meaning to offend you."
               Punks put the cheque on Coutts into his japanned box, and bowed most
                  obsequiously.
               "If you are ready to walk to the cottage, sir, allow me to offer my arm to Mrs.
                  Punks, and do you take care of my good lady," said Worthington.
               "My dear sir, ready in a minute," said Punks, as he popped into the parlor, and
                  sought his best hat.
               Happy Punks! happy Mrs. Punks! There they were, arm-in-arm, in the High-street of
                  Brackenbury, with the wealthy, charitable, pious tenants of the Clematis Cottage.
                  Punks enjoyed it amazingly, but thought Mr. Worthington walked very much too fast.
                  He wanted to prolong his triumph.
               The tea—Punks' best gunpowder at six-and-ten—was excellent; the toast—buttered with purest fresh at
                  fifteen-and-a-half from Punks's shop, was duly appreciated, and a heartier meal
                  was never made. Mrs. Worthington was so very kind and attentive, and Worthington's
                  conversation was so instructive, that hours passed like minutes, and it was
                  getting late when the silversmith ventured to allude to the object of their
                  meeting.
               "Really, my worthy brethren, your society has proved so agreeable—"
               "Fascinating, my love."
               "Don't interrupt me, Mrs. W.—so very agreeable, that I had forgotten all about the
                  plate. Have you brought it with you?" said Mr. Worthington.
               "Excuse me, sir, worthy sir, but it was so heavy that it took two porters to carry
                  it," said the silversmith. "Allow me to display it."
               The table was speedily cleared of the tea-things, and for more than an hour and a
                  half the party were busily engaged deciding between the merits of the Queen's
                  pattern, the Albert pattern, the Cottage pattern, and a great many other patterns
                  besides, including the fiddle pattern, which Worthington seemed inclined to
                  purchase because it was less showy than the others.
               Mrs. Worthington was all for the Queen's pattern, in which she was seconded by all
                  the party, for the silversmith had given them a secret hint, that it was the most
                  expensive, and by far the most profitable to himself.
               "Set them all aside, my dear, for a while," said Worthington. "Let us have a
                  sandwich, and try our friend Hutton's champagne."
               "You'll find it a superior article, rely upon it," said Mr. Hutton.
               "Which shall we try first—the Moet or the Ruinard?" said Mr. Worthington.
               "Try both," said Hutton, thinking that the sooner both cases were emptied, the
                  better it would be for himself.
               The party were all totallers, but somehow or another, in the excitement of the
                  moment, they forgot that they had taken the pledge. Pop, pop, pop, went cork after
                  cork, and everybody said that both were so excellent, that they could not decide
                  between the rival makers. Pop, pop, pop, again, without coming to any
                  decision.
               "Well, well," said Worthington, "I'll keep both cases; but you must throw off ten
                  shillings, ready money, recollect, or bill at two months, which is just as
                  good."
               "Can't, indeed I can't," said Hutton; "it's put in at the very lowest figure."
               "You may as well taste the Port, and the Madeira, and the Sherry, and the Claret,"
                  said Mrs. Worthington.
               "I think we had better, Mrs. W., my dear, we shall never get together such another
                  committee of taste."
               Pop went the corks, sip, sip, sip, first of one, and then of another sort. Louder
                  grew the tongues of the differing judges. Devilled biscuits and strong cheese were
                  introduced, more bottles were opened, and before the clock struck ten, the four
                  wax candles—Punks's best at three-and-nine—were multiplied into eight, and Mrs.
                  Punks felt so queer that she was obliged to retire.
               "Hark!" said Worthington, "I hear the sound of wheels. It's Trumps with the
                  pictures."
               All the party went out to see the van, in which a most valuable little collection
                  of pictures—real originals of the best masters—had been conveyed, for it was not
                  safe to bring them down by rail, "they were so very careless."
               "You won't unpack them to-night?" said Trumps.
               "Impossible," said Worthington, "put the van into the yard and lock the gates.
                  James shall sit up all night and watch it."
               
               "T—t—time to go," stammered out the silversmith.
               "Q—q—q—uite," said Punks. "Good night, respected friends."
               "But the plate?" said Mrs. Worthington.
               "I cannot think of letting our friend risk the removal of it to-night," said her
                  husband. "Let Mary take it carefully up stairs into our room, and do you see it
                  safely locked up in our cupboard."
               "I will take it up myself," said the lady.
               "Ve—ve—very much 'bliged to you, marm; go—good night," said the worthy
                  tradesman.
               "I wish you all good night, and thank you for your company. We meet at the chapel
                  to-morrow, of course," said Worthington.
               And so they did, at three services, during the performance of which the decorous
                  conduct of the Worthingtons, and the junior partner, Trumps, made a deep
                  impression on all the worshippers in the Ebenezer chapel. The plate was sent
                  round, too, for some colonial mission, and no one dropped gold into it but the
                  occupiers of Clematis Cottage and their junior partner.
               "A real blessing to the place," was the unanimous judgment of the good people of
                  Brackenbury.
               "Bless my soul! what can that be!" said Punks to the groceress, about twelve
                  o'clock on the Sunday night. "It's very like a stage-coach, only they are all dead
                  and buried."
               "It's wheels, that's certain. It must be the fire-engine—do jump out of bed and
                  see what it is," said Mrs. Punks.
               Punks rose reluctantly, for his head still ached, from having taken too much of
                  Hutton's samples. He drew aside the blind, opened the window, and caught sight of
                  a covered van being driven at a rapid rate on the road towards London. Two males
                  and a female sat on the box, and as they passed within a couple of yards of his
                  head, Punks heard a voice—a well known voice—say, "Go it, Trumps, there's the
                  spoon of a grocer."
               You might have knocked Punks down with a feather. He closed the window, drew the
                  curtains, and flung himself into bed, where he lay groaning deeply, and muttering,
                  "Done—clean done—five, four, ten and nine—sheer cash—groceries—hams, oh, Lord!
                  Responsible for introductions—poor Hutton's champagne! Six services of plate—off
                  by first train in the morning."
               As soon as it was light Punks was off without explaining further to his anxious
                  wife. Before he went down to the station he ran to Clematis Cottage and peeped in
                  at the window. Not a vestige of furniture was to be seen.
               
               "Sure it was so—catch them in town," said Punks, as he trotted to the early
                  train.
               It so happened that Mr. Hutton, the wine-merchant of Brackenbury, had occasion to
                  visit London the same day. He arrived about noon, and as he was walking along
                  Cheap-side, he saw a crowd collected. He ran to see the meaning of it; and to his
                  surprise, beheld his friend, the Deacon of the Ebenezer chapel, grasping "the real
                  blessing to the town" by his collar, and shouting for a policeman.
               "Are you mad, Punks?" said he; "you are apprehending the worthiest, most
                  liberal—"
               "No, I ain't," screamed Punks, "I am apprehending a Swindler—a Wolf in Sheep's
                  clothing, and I'll hang him if I can."
               "But you can't, my fine fellow, it's only a simple contract debt after all," said
                  Worthington, alias Slinking Tom.
               He was not hanged; merely sent out to over-colonize Van Diemen's Land, and the
                  Brackenburyans had a hearty laugh at the owner of Clematis Cottage and his pious
                  friends.
            
            
               
               Elkanah Smithers, Jun.
               I SHALL never forget my first journey from Limerick to Dublin. A day-coach had
                  been established, which was considered a marvel of celerity. It left Swinburne's
                  hotel early in the morning, and contrived to accomplish half of the journey that
                  day, arriving late in the evening at Mountrath, where the travellers slept,
                  whence, starting next morning, after an early breakfast, it entered the metropolis
                  by the light of the old oil-lamps, upon the second day. You may yet see the old
                  roadside inn a little way outside the town of Mountrath—a large high house,
                  retired a short way from the road, having a spacious sweep of gravelled space
                  before it, and a multitude of windows; but, alas! it is now falling fast into
                  decay; and one never sees the bustling face of the white-aproned waiter standing
                  at the door, or hears the crack of the postillion's whip as he leads out his
                  posters to horse a gentleman's travelling-carriage.
               Well, all that is past and gone. On the second day of our journey, we had all
                  assembled drowsily in the parlor, which smelled villanously of the preceding
                  night's supper, and had sat down to our hurried breakfast. By the time we had
                  half-finished our meal, a car drove up to the door, and in a few moments after a
                  gentleman entered in a large drab travelling-coat, with half a dozen capes, and a
                  huge red shawl wound around his neck. He deposited a travelling-case leisurely on
                  the sideboard, and then looked keenly around him. The survey did not seem to give
                  him much gratification. The eggs had all disappeared, and the cold beef was in a
                  very dilapidated condition. However, he sat down, took off his coat and shawl, and
                  addressed himself to the cold meat like a hungry man. The waiter made his
                  appearance.
               "Just five minutes more, gentlemen, the horses are putting to."
               The traveller looked up quietly. He was not a man to be put out of his way. He
                  ordered some eggs, and desired the waiter to make fresh tea.
               "Are you going by the coach, sir?" inquired the attendant.
               "Yes, certainly," was the reply, in an English accent (he was a traveller from a
                  London house), "but I must have my breakfast first; so be quick, will you?"
               The waiter left the room, and immediately after we heard the fellow telling the
                  guard to be expeditious; an exhortation to which that worthy responded by a
                  clamorous blast of his horn that made us all start from our seats, and hurry out
                  of the room, leaving the English gentleman alone to finish his breakfast, which,
                  to do him justice, he seemed by no means disposed to neglect. The waiter,
                  meantime, brought in the tea, and retired; but was speedily summoned back by a
                  vigorous ringing of the bell.
               "A spoon, please," said the gentleman.
               The waiter advanced to the table to procure the article, but, to his astonishment,
                  there was not a spoon to be seen; nay, even those which had been in the cups had
                  all disappeared.
               
               "Blessed Virgin!" ejaculated the dismayed attendant, "what's become of all the
                  spoons!"
               "That's just what I want to know, you blockhead," said the other.
               "Two dozen and a half—real silver," cried Tom.
               "I want only one," said the gentleman. "Haven't you a spoon in your establishment,
                  my man?"
               Tom made no reply, but rushed directly out of the room, and running up to the
                  coachman, cried out, "Stop, Dempsey, for the love of heaven!"
               "All right!" says Dempsey, with a twirl of his whip, gathering up the reins, and
                  preparing to start—for we had all taken our places.
               "'Tisn't all right, I tell you," cried Tom, "where are the spoons?"
               "What spoons? Arrah! don't be bothering us, man: and we five minutes behind time.
                  Joey, hold that off-leader's head, till she goes on a bit."
               By this time the master of the inn had come out to learn what all the hubbub was
                  about. Tom, half-blubbering, poor fellow, made him acquainted with the fact, that
                  all his silver spoons had vanished. The landlord cried out "robbery!" the
                  housemaids screamed out "murder!" and a variety of other exclamations, too
                  dreadful to contemplate. When silence was restored, the inn-keeper insisted on
                  stopping the coach till he ascertained if the report of Tom was true. Ere many
                  moments he returned, as pale as a ghost, and said—
               "Gentlemen, I'm sorry to trouble you; but I must beg you'll come down, till a
                  search is made for my property. Tom, here, will swear that there was a spoon in
                  every tea-cup this morning as usual—won't you, Tom?"
               "Bedad, I'll take my Bible-oath of that same, sure enough," replied Tom; "and sure
                  I didn't swallow them."
               The passengers all indignantly refused to submit to the search proposed by the
                  landlord. An old lady inside went off in hysterics, when the inn-keeper opened the
                  door, and proposed to turn her pockets inside out. There was an officer with a
                  wooden leg on the box-seat, who swore, in the most awful manner, that he would run
                  the first man through the body that attempted to lay a hand on him—by the way, he
                  hadn't a sword, but he forgot that in his fury. There was a justice of the peace
                  for the county, who protested that he would commit the host for contempt; and a
                  Dublin attorney in the back-seat intimated his determination to indict Tom, who
                  had laid hold of his leg, for an assault; and, moreover, to commence an action
                  against his master for defamation. As I was but a youngster then, and the weakest
                  of the party, the landlord chucked me down in a twinkling, and hauled me into the
                  parlor, half dead with fright; and thereupon the rest of the passengers, including
                  the wooden-legged captain, scrambled down, and followed, determined to make common
                  cause and protect me from insult with their lives, if necessary. And now we were
                  all again in the breakfast-room, clamoring and remonstrating, while, to add to the
                  din, the guard kept up a continual brattle with his horn. All this time the
                  English gentleman was steadily prosecuting his work upon the eggs and toast, with
                  a cup of tea before him, which he was leisurely sipping, quite at his ease
                  like.
               "What the deuce is the matter!" said he, looking up, "can't you let a man take his
                  breakfast in comfort?"
               "The plate!" said the master.
               "The silver spoons!" cried the butler.
               "Robbery!" shouted the mistress.
               "Murder!" &c., screamed the housemaids.
               "Search every one," demanded the host; "come, let us begin with this young chap," diving his hand into
                  my breeches pocket.
               "I think," said the English gentleman, coolly, "'twould be as well first to search
                  the premises. Is the waiter long in your service?"
               "Fifteen years last Shrovetide, and I defy any man to lay as much as the big of
                  his nail to my charge."
               By this time the English gentleman had finished his breakfast, and, wiping his
                  mouth most deliberately, he commenced to search the room. He opened every drawer
                  of the sideboard, then he looked under the table, then behind the window-shutters,
                  but all in vain. After that he stopped a moment to reflect, when a bright thought
                  seemed to cross his mind, and he raised the lid of one of the teapots, but with as
                  little success as before; nevertheless, he continued his examination of the
                  teapots, and when he came to the last, what do you think, but he thrust in his
                  hand, and drew out first one spoon, and then another, till he laid a number of
                  them on the table. Tom rushed up and began to count—"Two, four, six," and so on,
                  till at length he exclaimed—
               "May I never see glory, but they're all right, every one. The Lord between us and
                  harm, but this bangs all that ever I seen!"
               "I'll tell you what, my man," said the gentleman, looking sternly at the
                  astonished waiter, "I strongly suspect you have been playing tricks upon your
                  master. A nice haul you'd have had of it when the company had gone away! I don't
                  like the look of the fellow, I tell you," he continued, addressing himself to the
                  host; "and if it wasn't for the fortunate circumstances of my coming in a little
                  late and wanting a spoon, you would have lost your property, sir. You may count it
                  a lucky day that I came to your house."
               The landlord was struck dumb with amazement; even the mistress hadn't a word to
                  say, though she looked wickedly edly at poor Tom, and the housemaids began to cry
                  and bless themselves.
               "Gentlemen," proceeded the Englishman, "I hope you will overlook the insult you
                  have received; as, after all, the landlord is not to be blamed; and if he will
                  insist on this blackguard waiter making an ample apology, I will take upon me to
                  say for you all, that you will not take any proceedings."
               All cheerfully expressed their assent to the proposition except the attorney, who
                  still muttered something about assault and defamation, which so terrified Tom that
                  he most humbly entreated pardon of the whole company, though he still protested
                  that he was innocent of the crime laid to his charge.
               "Gammon!" said the gentleman; "but as you have made proper submission, and nothing
                  has been lost, I shall make it a further condition with your master, that he won't
                  turn you adrift on the world with a thief's character, but give you an opportunity
                  of reforming. Keep a sharp eye on him, however, sir, I advise you. And now,
                  gentlemen, I think we'd better be moving."
               We all hurried out and took our places, the English gentleman getting up on the
                  seat behind the coachman. Dempsey "threw the silk" into the horses; the guard blew
                  an impatient blast on his horn, and off we went at a slapping pace, the host
                  bowing humbly to us until we were out of sight.
               "I'm driving on this road these ten years," said Dempsey, when he slackened his
                  pace up a hill; "and I never knew such a thing as that happen before."
               "Very likely," said the Englishman, quietly, "and never will again."
               "I always thought Tom Reilly was as honest a fellow, man and boy, as any in the
                  parish."
               
               "I make no doubt he is," replied the other; "he has a very honest
                  countenance."
               "I thought, sir," said the captain, "you said you didn't like his look?"
               "Maybe I did say so," was the reply.
               "And pray, sir, do you still think 'twas he hid the spoons?"
               "Not a bit of it."
               "Then who the d—I did?"
               "I did. Do you think I'm green enough to travel so cold a morning as this without
                  having a comfortable breakfast?"
               "Well," said Dempsey, "that's the knowingest trick I ever heard of in my
                  life."
               "Not bad," replied the gentleman, with great sang-froid, "but it won't do to be repeated."
               When we arrived at Portarlington, the gentleman—who, by the way, turned out to be
                  a very pleasant fellow, and up to all sorts of life—got off the coach, and ordered
                  his travelling-case to be taken into the inn.
               "Do you stop here, sir?" asked the coachman.
               "Yes, sir, for the present. I have a little business to do here as well as at
                  Mountrath."
               The gentleman having given the usual gratuity to the guard and coachman, and also
                  a slip of paper to Dempsey, which he directed him to give to the host at
                  Mountrath, passed into the inn; the coach drove on, and I never saw him again.
               Dempsey having pocketed the shilling, looked at the paper with some curiosity, in
                  which, to say the truth, we all shared.
               "There's no harm in reading it, as it is open," said the Captain, taking it from
                  Dempsey.
               They were a few lines, written in pencil, on the leaf of a pocket-book, and the
                  Captain read them out—I remember them to this day:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "This is to certify that Tom Reilly put nothing into the teapot this
                              morning except hot water and sloe-leaves, and that the other
                              ingredients, the spoons, were added by me, for the purpose of giving
                              the composition some strength. I further certify that the aforesaid
                              spoons are capital for making 'stir.'
                           
                              "Given under my hand,
                              "ELKANAH SMITHERS, Jun."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               You may be sure we all enjoyed this finish to the joke, and Dempsey forwarded the
                  paper by the down-coach, that poor Tom Reilly's character might be cleared with
                  the least possible delay. Tom was fully reinstated in the confidence of his
                  employers; but the landlady had got such a fright that she determined her silver
                  spoons should never again be placed at the mercy of any traveller. Accordingly,
                  she transferred them to the private part of the establishment, substituting for
                  them in the public room a set of very neat pewter articles—there was no German
                  silver, or albata, or such things in those days—which, when cleaned, looked nearly
                  as well as silver. Many a time I stirred my tea at breakfast with one of them, and
                  thought of "Elkanah Smithers, jun."
            
            
               
               Infatuation.
               ONE summer's evening two gentlemen were seated at a well-spread dessert table in
                  an aristocratic quarter of West-London. He at its head, its master, was a fine,
                  stately man, wearing in his countenance, in its expression and form of feature,
                  the impress of true nobility—nature's nobility, not that of the peerage, for in
                  reality he was only a merchant, though one of the first class. His lady
                     wife—she was the daughter of a peer—had just quitted the room, and
                  left them to themselves. They were the heads of the well known City firm, "Grubb
                  and Howard." Mr. Howard had walked up from the City at this evening hour to confer
                  upon a matter, which had come to his knowledge, with his senior partner—senior in
                  authority, but his junior in years; a private engagement having brought Mr. Grubb
                  away from the City at mid-day.
               "Did you draw a cheque on Saturday morning, before leaving home, in favor of self,
                  and get it cashed?" began James Howard, as Mr. Grubb returned to his seat, from
                  closing the door after Lady Adela. "At Glyn's."
               The merchant threw his thoughts back to Saturday morning. The reminiscence was
                  unpleasant. For a scene had taken place with his wife, painful to him, disgraceful
                  to her. He had drawn no cheque.
               "No," he answered.
               "A cheque for ¥500 in favor of self?" continued Mr. Howard, slowly sipping his
                  port wine.
               "I don't draw at Glyn's in favor of self," interrupted the merchant, "only at my
                  private banker's. You know that, Howard, as well as I do."
               "Just so. Therefore, upon the fact coming to our notice this afternoon that such a
                  cheque had been drawn and paid, I stepped over to Glyn's and made inquiries."
               "Well?"
               "Well, there it was, safe enough: a cheque purporting to be drawn and signed by
                  you."
               "Charles Grubb?"
               "No; the firm signature, 'Grubb and Howard.' And a very good imitation it is. But
                  if it is your writing, your hand was nervous when you wrote it, rendering the
                  letters less decided than usual."
               "Who presented it?" inquired Mr. Grubb.
               "Mr. Cleveland. And he received the money."
               "Cleveland!" uttered Mr. Grubb, in the most astonished tone. "There is some
                  mystery about this."
               "So it seemed to me," answered the junior partner. "Cleveland's out of town, you
                  said, to-day."
               "Went down yesterday to Brighton, to his father's. Will be home in the morning.
                  But how did he procure the cheque? Who drew it?" resumed the puzzled merchant.
                  "Where's the money?"
               "It was Saturday morning that you left the cheque-book at home and sent Cleveland
                  for it, if you remember."
               "Ah, to be sure it was," echoed the merchant, quickly. "A long while he was
                  gone."
               "And during this period, between ten and half-past eleven, the cheque was presented and cashed. I
                  thought he was of improvident habits, but never suspected he was one to help
                  himself——"
               "He cannot have helped himself in this sort of way," interrupted Mr.
                  Grubb earnestly. "Cleveland is a wild, random species of young fellow, and has his
                  faults, but he is certainly not one to descend to guilt of this nature."
               "He is reckless in his expenditure, and is never out of debt—as I hear," urged
                  James Howard.
               "Very likely. I don't doubt he is of the fast genus. But that does not prove he
                  would defraud us. The thing's impossible, Howard."
               "He presented the cheque and received the money," dryly remarked Mr. Howard. "What
                  has he done with it?"
               "But no madman would go to work in this barefaced way," replied his more
                  generous-minded partner, "bringing immediate detection and punishment down upon
                  his head."
               "Suppose you inquire what clothes he took with him," suggested Mr. Howard. "My
                  impression is, that he's off. The Brighton tale may have been a blind."
               Mr. Grubb rose and rang the bell, staggered nearly out of his senses; and, until
                  it was answered, not another word was spoken. Each gentleman was busy with his own
                  thoughts.
               "Richard," said the master, "when Mr. Cleveland left for Brighton yesterday
                  morning, did he take much luggage with him?"
               "I don't think he took any, sir, unless it was his small portmanteau."
               "Did you happen to hear him say whether he contemplated making a longer stay than
                  usual?"
               "I did not hear him say anything, sir. But Mr. Cleveland is back."
               "Back!" echoed Mr. Howard, surprised into the interference.
               "He came back a few minutes ago, sir."
               "Is he in now?" asked Mr. Grubb.
               "No, sir; he went out again almost directly. The cab waited for him. He is gone to
                  dine at the Army and Navy."
               "Then no elucidation can now take place till morning," observed Mr. Grubb, as the
                  servant withdrew. "When he goes out on these dining bouts he is never home till
                  late, sometimes not at all. But rely upon it, Howard, this matter will be cleared
                  up. Cleveland is no forger."
               "Hope it may," sarcastically uttered the junior partner.
               The merchant was seated next morning at his breakfast alone, for the Lady Adela
                  never condescended to breakfast with her husband, and Charles Cleveland had not
                  made his appearance.
               "Does Mr. Cleveland know I am at breakfast?" he inquired of the servant.
               "Mr. Cleveland left word—I beg your pardon, sir, I forgot to mention it—that he
                  was gone out to breakfast with his brother, Captain Cleveland, who sails to-day
                  for India."
               Twelve o'clock was heard striking by St. Paul's, in the City premises of Messrs.
                  Grubb and Howard, and no Charles Cleveland had made his appearance. Both partners,
                  with a gentleman from Glyn's, were assembled in a private room, the latter
                  gentleman and Mr. Howard fully persuaded that the delinquent had embarked for
                  India with his brother, or some other place not speedily accessible to officers of
                  justice. But ere the clock had well finished striking Charley himself came in,
                  bustling and out of breath.
               "I beg your pardon, sir, for being so late," he panted, addressing himself to Mr.
                  Grubb, "especially after my holiday of yesterday. I went early this morning to
                  Woolwich, and on board my brother's ship, intending to be up by business hours,
                  but, what with one delay and another, I was unable to get back till now."
               
               "Take a seat, Mr. Cleveland," was the reply. "We have a few questions to put to
                  you."
               Charles glanced round. In his hurry, he had seen no one but Mr. Grubb. His eye now
                  fell on the banker: he knew him well; and knew that the time was come when he
                  would have need of all his presence of mind and his energies.
               "You presented a cheque for ¥500 at Glyn's on Saturday morning, and received the
                  amount in notes," began Mr. Grubb. "From whom did you get that cheque?"
               No reply.
               "Purporting to be drawn and signed by me," continued Mr. Grubb. "I ask from whom
                  you received it?"
               "I decline to answer," he said at length, speaking with hesitation, in spite of
                  his resolve for firmness.
               "Do you deny having presented the cheque?"
               "No. I do not deny that."
               "Do you deny having received the money for it?" questioned the banker.
               "Nor that either. I acknowledge to have received ¥500. It would be folly to deny
                  it," he continued, in a sort of calm desperation, "since the bank could prove the
                  contrary."
               "But did you know what you were laying yourself open to?" asked Mr. Grubb,
                  evidently in a maze of astonishment.
               "I know now, sir."
               "Will you refund the money?" interposed Mr. Howard. "Out of consideration for your
                  family, connected, as it is, with that of the head of our firm, we are willing
                  to——"
               "I cannot refund it, and I must decline to answer any more questions," interrupted
                  Mr. Cleveland, fast relapsing into agitation.
               Mr. Howard stepped into the next room, and soon a policeman was added to the
                  group.
               "It is our duty to give this gentleman into custody for forgery," said James
                  Howard, pointing at Charles Cleveland land, who was standing side by side with Mr.
                  Grubb: but the policeman, mistaking the direction, laid his arm on that of the
                  head of the firm.
               "Not me," said the merchant, with a slight smile.
               "Why, officer, what are you thinking of?" cried the banker, indignantly. "Don't
                  you know this gentleman yet—Mr. Grubb? You are a City policeman."
               "No offence," deprecated the policeman, transferring his attention to Mr. Charles.
                  "I'm sure I beg your pardon, sir, but I thought the gentleman pointed to you. And
                  so many, where you'd least expect it, get into trouble now, that if they handed
                  over to us a duke, we should just take him, and make no bones about it. Is the
                  charge to be gone into to-day?"
               "Without any delay," peremptorily uttered Mr. Howard.
               "Oh, sir!" exclaimed Charles Cleveland, turning to Mr. Grubb, in a high state of
                  excitement, "will you look over this one error? My father will replace the money—I
                  am sure he will, rather than suffer this public disgrace to fall upon the family.
                  Do not force the shame upon him."
               Mr. Grubb drew him aside from the rest, and spoke to him in private. "If I afford
                  you the opportunity, will you tell me the circumstances of the case?" he asked,
                  "for I own to you that your conduct appears to me perfectly incomprehensible.
                  There is some mystery in the affair, which I do not fathom. It may be better for
                  you to confide in me."
               "I cannot," returned Cleveland.
               "What if I tell you that, in spite of appearances, I do not myself believe you
                  guilty?"
               A bright, eager flush, a glance of understanding, illumined for a
                  moment Charley's face. It seemed to say that just, honorable natures know and
                  trust in each other's innocence, no
                  matter what may be the signs of guilt. But the transient expression faded away to
                  sadness.
               "I can explain nothing," he said; "I can only thank you, sir, for this proof of
                  confidence, and implore your clemency on the ground of compassion alone."
               "Then there is no more to be said. Policeman," added the merchant, walking
                  forward, "do your duty."
               What a commotion arose in all the clubs! Charles Cleveland in Newgate, on a charge
                  of forgery! Charley Cleveland the popular—Charley Cleveland the grandson of an
                  earl gathered to his fathers, and nephew of the one who stood in his shoes—Charley
                  Cleveland, the out-and-out good fellow, who was wont to scare the blue devils away
                  from everybody—Charley Cleveland who, in defiance of his improvidence and his
                  shallow pocket, was known to be of the nicest honor amongst the honorable!
               "The thing's preposterous altogether," stuttered John Cust. "If Charley had drawn
                  the money, he would have had the money, and I know that on Saturday afternoon he
                  had not a rap, for he borrowed three sovs. of me to take him down to Brighton,
                  where he went to try and knock some tin out of his governor."
               "Which he did," added Lord Deerhum. "A ten-pounder."
               "And paid me back the three, on the Monday night, when he came to his brother's
                  spread at the Rag and Famish. Gammon! Charley has not been making free with Old
                  Grubb's name."
               "But he acknowledges to having drawn the money," squeaked Booby Charteries.
                  "That's proved."
               "You may take that in yourself, Booby. We don't."
               "But the Lord Mayor——"
               "Lord Mayor be hanged! If he swears, till he's black in the face, that Charley had
                  it, I know he didn't. There."
               "Let's cut down to Newgate, and have a smoke with him," returned Booby Charteries;
                  "it may cheer the fellow up under the present alarming state of things."
               "As if they'd admit us inside Newgate, or a smoke either!" uttered John Cust.
                  "There's only one thing more difficult than getting in, and that is, if you are
                  in, getting out again. Newgate's no go, Booby."
               "I propose that we have a throw which of us shall go and punch Old Grubb's head,
                  for making the charge," proposed Lord Deerhum. "It would do these city plodders
                  good, to be taught what it is to insult our order, especially a popular chap like
                  Charley."
               The Honorable Mr. Cleveland came up from Brighton to find his son lying in Newgate
                  on a charge of forgery. At the examination, Charles had attempted no defence,
                  stating to the magistrate that he had none to make; so he was committed for trial,
                  there and then. His father, who obtained an order to visit him in Newgate, found
                  him, even in that short period, greatly changed. His dress was neglected, his hair
                  unkempt, and his face haggard. Charley the fastidious!
               Mr. Cleveland was overcome beyond control, and sobbed aloud. He was a
                  venerable-looking man of sixty years, and had always been a fond father. Charley
                  was not so much affected.
               "Why did you not kill me when you last came down, Charles!" he moaned. "Better
                  have put me out of this world of pain than bring this misery upon me. Oh, my boy!
                  my boy! you were your mother's favorite; how can you so have disgraced her
                  memory?"
               "I would I had been out of the world rather than be the curse to you I have
                  proved," writhed Charley, wishing Newgate would yawn asunder and engulph him. "Oh,
                  don't—father, don't!" he implored, as Mr. Cleveland's sighs echoed through the cell. "If it will be any
                  consolation to know it, I will vow to you that I am not guilty," he added, the
                  sight of his father's affliction momentarily outweighing his precaution. "By all
                  your care of me, by your present grief, by the memory of my dead mother, I swear
                  to you I am not guilty."
               Mr. Cleveland looked up, and his heart leaped within him. He knew Charles was
                  speaking truth.
               "Then what is this I hear, about your declining to make a defence?"
               Charles hung his head and relapsed into prudence again.
               "My boy, answer me. How came you to accept—as it were—the charge?"
               "For your private comfort I have said this, dear father, but it must remain
                  between us as if it had not been spoken. The world must still, and always, believe
                  me guilty."
               "But why?—why? What mystery is this?"
               "Do not ask me, sir. Believe that you have not a son more free from the guilt of
                  this crime than I am. Nevertheless, I must pay the penalty, for I cannot defend
                  myself."
               Mr. Cleveland could get nothing more out of Charles. From Newgate he went to Mr.
                  Grubb's counting-house.
               "You are not more pained at this affair than I am," said the latter, closing the
                  door of his private room, "and certainly not more astonished."
               "Oh, Mr. Grubb," cried the old man, "could you not have hushed this wretched
                  disgrace up, for the family's sake?"
               'I would have hushed it up. I asked Charles, in this very room, to acknowledge the
                  truth to me privately. Had he done so, even though it was to avow his guilt, I
                  should not have proceeded. But he would not say a word, and told me he would
                  not."
               "Will you state the particulars to me?" resumed Mr. Cleveland. "I asked them of
                  him, but he would not give them."
               "It occurred on Saturday morning. When I reached the City, I found I had not got
                  my cheque-book, and sent Charles home to look for it. He was a long while gone,
                  but brought it when he came. During the period of his absence, one of the cheques
                  was abstracted, filled up for ¥500, and——"
               "Filled up by whom?"
               "Charles presented it, and received the money. That is all we know with certainty;
                  but of course there is only one deduction to be drawn, as to who filled it
                  in."
               "Was it his hand-writing?"
               "It was an imitation of mine."
               "Mr. Grubb," cried the agitated father, "appearances are against him—were never
                  more strongly against any one—but, before Heaven, I believe him innocent."
               The merchant did not reply.
               "He has assured me of his innocence, by the memory of his dead mother; and
                  innocent I know he is, though he stated in the same breath he should avow it to no
                  one else, but submit to the penalty of the crime, just as if he had committed it.
                  There is one point—if Charles drew this money for himself, what did he do with it?
                  On that very after noon he had to borrow money to bring him down to Brighton. John
                  Cust lent it to him."
               "It is very singular," mused Mr. Grubb.
               "Can he have been made the innocent instrument of another? Can he have been
                  imposed upon by any one?"
               "Not likely," replied Mr. Grubb. "Were that the case, what would be his objection
                  to declare the truth?"
               Nevertheless, the words haunted the merchant. Can he have been made the
                     innocent instrument of another? An idea had been given to him—a painful
                  idea; and, do what he would, he could not
                  drive it away. It intruded itself into his business; it followed him home to
                  dinner; and it worried him at his club in the evening, and drove him back home
                  again before ten o'clock. He had determined to speak a word with Lady Adela.
               "Her ladyship is out, sir," said the servant.
               "Inquire where she is gone?"
               "To Lady Sanely's," was the answer.
               The merchant suppressed a groan, drew his hand across his perplexed forehead, and
                  sat on, in his solitary drawing-room. Presently he again rang the bell.
               "Send Wilson here." And the butler appeared in answer to the summons.
               "Wilson—shut the door. You know of course of this business about Mr. Cleveland,
                  for it is all over London I believe by this time. Did you see Mr. Cleveland on
                  Saturday morning, when he came for the cheque-book?"
               "Yes, sir. I was at the door, talking to a friend who had called, when Mr.
                  Cleveland ran in, and went up to the drawing-room to Lady Adela."
               "Well, what next?"
               "After that, sir, I was still at the door—it could not have been above two or
                  three minutes—when he came down again. He seemed in a desperate hurry, and called
                  out to a cab which was going by, and went away in it, at a great rate."
               "He came back again?"
               "Yes, sir, but not directly. I should think it might have been three-quarters of
                  an hour; perhaps more, for I did not take special note of the time. I was cleaning
                  the hall-lamp then, and when the door was opened to him, I saw it was the same
                  cab."
               "Did he go into the breakfast-room?"
               "Not at once, sir. He went up to the drawing-room for a minute, first, and when he
                  came down to the breakfast-room, her ladyship came with him. After that he got
                  into the cab again, and it galloped away. Taking both times together, he was not
                  in the house five minutes."
               "Not long enough to——" Mr. Grubb checked himself, and remained silent.
               "Not long enough to have drawn a false cheque, sir, when the handwriting has to be
                  studied—as we have been saying below," said the butler, following too closely his
                  master's thoughts. "But perhaps he had got it done beforehand. We would sooner
                  have suspected almost any one than him, till this came out. It shows, sir, how one
                  may be deceived in persons."
               Lady Adela was home at twelve o'clock, earlier than she usually came from Lady
                  Sanely's. She was going up-stairs to her chamber, when Mr. Grubb stopped her.
               "This is a shocking business about Cleveland, Lady Adela."
               "Yes," she answered, throwing herself into a chair. "I hope your revenge is sated
                  now. You had a paltry spite against him, and you have cast him into Newgate to
                  gratify it; ruined his prospects, and brought disgrace upon his family, and on my
                  sister Mary."
               He did not reply: he was accustomed to bear her unjust accusations. "Lady Adela,"
                  he said, dropping his voice to a whisper, "were you wholly ignorant of this
                  business? Who drew the cheque?"
               She started up from her chair, and fixed her eyes defiantly upon him.
               "Adela, my wife," he whispered, going forward, and laying his hands upon her
                  shoulders, in his earnestness, "if you had anything to do with this, if Cleveland
                  was not the guilty party, acknowledge it now. Confide in me for once. I will avert
                  consequences from him, and suspicion from
                  you. The secret shall be buried in my breast, and I will never revert to it."
               Her lovely features had grown white, and her haughty eyes fell before his; but
                  presently she raised them, flashing with indignation. "How dare you offer me this
                  insult?" she shrieked. "Is it your design to bring a charge of felony against me,
                  as you have against him—to send me for trial at the Central Criminal Court?"
               "Do not meet my words in this cruel way, Adela. I am asking you a solemn question,
                  and there is One above who will hear and register your answer. Were you the
                  principal in this transaction, and was Cleveland but your agent? Do not fear to
                  trust me—your husband—you shall have my free forgiveness now,
                  beforehand, my shelter, my protection. Only tell me the truth, as you wish it to
                  be well with us both in after life."
               Again she cowered before his gaze. What made her—she, so bold and defiant? Again
                  she recovered herself, and threw a full amount of flashing scorn into her
                  answer.
               "You ought to be ashamed of your question. I had nothing to do with it; what could
                  I have had? None but a mean, suspicion-seeking spirit could imagine such a
                  thing."
               "This is all you can say to me—your definitive answer?"
               "Definitive enough," she retorted with a screaming, nervous laugh. "And now you
                  have had your say, Mr. Grubb, listen to me. Never speak on the subject to me
                  again, if you would keep the semblance of peace between us. My feelings have been
                  dangerously roused against you, for your barbarous injustice to Charles
                  Cleveland."
               As she spoke, she left the room, leaving him to his feelings. Few can
                  imagine them—torn, outraged, thrown back upon him. But she had lulled his doubts
                  against her self. "It must have been Cleveland's own doing, and no other's," he
                  mentally concluded; "what strange mania could have come over him?"
               The most able counsel in the land were engaged to defend Charles Cleveland, but
                  that gentleman provoked them very considerably. The old saying, "Tell your whole
                  case to your lawyer and your doctor," is essential advice, but Charles would tell
                  nothing, neither truth nor falsehood. In vain Serjeant Mowham protested, with
                  tears in his eyes (a stock of which, so the bar affirmed, he kept in readiness),
                  that he was working in the dark, that without some clue or hint to go upon, he
                  could make no defence that had a chance of success, even if he told all the
                     untruths that ever serjeant's tongue gave utterance to. The
                  prisoner was immovable; the lawyers were in despair.
               One day, the Earl of Oakton had a slice of luck. He had backed a certain horse at
                  a provincial race meeting, and the horse won. Amongst other moneys that changed
                  hands in London, on the settling day, was a ¥50 note. An hour after the Earl
                  received it, he made his way into his drawing-room, in haste, where sat his
                  daughters, Grace, and Mary Cleveland, the latter, with her husband and infant,
                  having been staying in town, at the earl's, since the outbreak of the unfortunate
                  business.
               "Mary," cried the earl, "what were the numbers of the notes paid over to Charles
                  Cleveland by Glyn's?"
               "Mr. Cleveland has them, I believe," answered Lady Mary. "But the thing has given
                  me by far too much worry, papa, for me to retain the numbers in my head."
               "I have them," interrupted Lady Grace Chenevix. "I copied them the other day.
                  There was no knowing, I thought, but they might prove useful."
               "Quite right, Gracie, girl," said the earl. "Let's see them. '3,0,2,5,5,'" continued Lord Oakton, reading
                  one of the numbers which Lady Grace laid before him. "I thought so. One of these
                  notes has just been paid to me, Mary, by young Waterware."
               "Where did he get it?" eagerly inquired Lady Grace Chenevix.
               "I did not ask him. I thought I'd first ascertain whether I was right in my
                  suspicions. I'll get it out of him by-and-by."
               "At once, at once, sir," rejoined Lady Mary.
               "No impatience, Mary. Where the deuce am I to pick up Waterware, at this time of
                  day? I might as well look for a needle in a bottle of hay. To-night I shall know
                  where to find him."
               Chance, however, favored the earl. In strolling up St. James's street, not long
                  afterwards, he met Lord Water-ware.
               "I say, Waterware," he began, linking his arm in that of the younger peer, "where
                  did you get that fifty-pound note you paid me over this morning?"
               "Where did I get it! Let's see. Oh, from Nile. He was owing me a hundred, and he
                  stumped up yesterday. That fifty, two twenties, and a ten. Why? It's not forged, I
                  suppose," cried the young nobleman, with a yawn.
               "Not exactly. Wish I had a handful of them. Good morning! I'm going on to
                  Nile's."
               Colonel Nile was at home, in his chambers. A middle-aged man and a bachelor,
                  essentially a "man about town." Possessing very little income of his own, he yet
                  contrived to live luxuriously.
               "The fifty-pound note I paid over to Waterware," repeated Colonel Nile,
                  cautiously, and somewhat surprised at the question. "Why do you want to know where
                  I got it?"
               "Because it is one of the notes that Charley Cleveland's in quod for; the first
                  that has been traced. You must give me the information, Nile, or I shall apply for
                  it publicly."
               "Oh, I have no objection in the world," cried the Colonel, determined to afford
                  all that was in his power, and so wash his hands of any
                  unpleasantness that might turn up. "I received it at Lady Sanely's loo-table,
                  from—egad! from your own daughter, Lady Adela."
               "From Lady Adela?" echoed the surprised nobleman.
               "From Lady Adela, and nobody else," repeated Colonel Nile. "She paid another fifty
                  to the old Dowager Beck, the same evening."
               "What was the number of that?" inquired Lord Oakton.
               "How should I know?" retorted the Colonel. "It is not my business to pry into
                  notes which don't concern me."
               The Earl of Oakton proceeded straight to Lady Beck's; and, with much trouble and
                  persuasion, she was induced to exhibit the note spoken of by Col. Nile, which was
                  still in her possession. The old dowager was verging on her dotage, and could not,
                  at first, be convinced but that the earl was going to take law proceedings against
                  her, for winning money of his daughter. The earl soothed her, copied the number by
                  stealth, went home, and compared it with Lady Grace's pocket-book. It was
                     another of the notes.
               
               "What do you think of it, Grace?" cried the earl, in perplexity. "Can Cleveland
                  have been owing money to Adela?"
               "I should imagine not," replied Lady Grace.
               "It wears a singular appearance," mused the earl. "To tell you the truth, Grace, I
                  don't like the fact of these notes being traced to Adela. It looks—after the rumor
                  of that absurd flirtation they carried on—almost as if she and Cleveland had gone
                  snacks in the spoil. What now, Gracie? Are you going to fly?"
               For Lady Grace Chenevix had bounded from her chair in sudden agitation, her arms working as she paced
                  up and down the room. "Sir! father! the thing has become clear to me. That I
                  should not have suspected it before? knowing what I did know."
               "Child!" cried the earl, gazing at her in amazement, "what ever is the
                  matter?"
               "Adela did this. I see it all. Charles Cleveland was only her instrument, and, in
                  his infatuated attachment, he has taken the guilt on himself, to shield her. Well
                  may he have asserted his innocence to his father! Well may his conduct have
                  appeared to us all so incomprehensible!"
               "Why, Grace, you are mad!" gasped the earl. "Accuse your sister of—of—forgery. Do
                  you reflect on the meaning of your words?"
               "Father, do not look so stern at me. I know I am right. I assure you it is as if
                  some power of might had torn scales from my eyes, for I see it perfectly clear.
                  Adela wanted money for play; she had been drawn in, far deeper than you suspected,
                  sir, at Lady Sanely's gaming-table. It was Mr. Grubb's intention to refuse her
                  funds—"
               "How do you know?"
               "I do know it, sir, never mind how. No doubt he did refuse her, and she, when his
                  cheque-book fell into her hands——"
               "Don't continue, Grace," sharply interposed Lord Oak-ton; "you make my blood run
                  cold. You must prove what you assert, or retract it. If—it—is
                  proved," the earl drew a long breath—"Cleveland must be extricated. What a
                  thundering fool the fellow must be!"
               "Let me have time to think," said Lady Grace. "Extricated of course he must be,
                  but without exposing her. Don't say yet, sir, even to Mary, that you
                  have compared the numbers of the notes."
               Lady Grace sought an interview with Mr. Grubb. She went to his house that evening,
                  but she found he was gone to his club, and her sister to the Opera. So Grace
                  dismissed her carriage, went up to the drawing-room, and wrote a word to Mr.
                  Grubb, asking him to come home. The thought crossed her, that perhaps it was not
                  quite the thing to do, but Lady Grace Chenevix was not one to stand upon
                  ceremony.
               He returned at once, full of bustle and curiosity. "Anything the matter, Grace?
                  Anything amiss with Adela? She's not ill?"
               "She is at the Opera, I hear; very well, no doubt." And then she imparted her
                  suspicions—just an allusion to them—that her poor sister was the culprit.
               "Grace," he whispered, "I don't mind telling you that the same fear haunted me,
                  and I taxed her with it. She indignantly denied it."
               "Two of the notes have been traced," murmured Lady Grace.
               "Traced!"
               "Paid away by Adela, at Lady Sanely's."
               There was a dead silence. Lady Grace Chenevix did not raise her eyelids, for she
                  felt keenly the pain of the avowal, and an ominous shade of despair overspread the
                  merchant's face.
               "Grace, Grace," he broke forth in anguish, "what is it you are saying?"
               "One of them, for ¥50, came into my father's hands today, and he has traced it
                  back to Adela. Another of them she paid the same evening to the Dowager Beck. What
                  inference could I draw, Mr. Grubb, but that she——you know what I would say."
               "Could she descend to be a party to such disgrace with Charles Cleveland?" he
                  groaned.
               "Charles was no party to it," cried Lady Grace, warmly ly; "he was her instrument, nothing more. Whatever
                  may be his follies, he is the soul of honor. And it is a sort of chivalrous sense
                  of honor, depend upon it, which is causing him to shield her, now the matter is
                  come out. What is to be done? Charles Cleveland must not stand before his country
                  a felon."
               "Heaven forbid—if he is indeed innocent. But, Grace—after Adela's solemn assertion
                  that she had nothing to do with it, when I conjured her to tell me, her husband,
                  the truth, and I would forgive and protect her, how is it possible to believe that
                  she is guilty?"
               Lady Grace answered by a gesture: her sister's assertions did not go for much with
                  her. "I fear this passion for play has taken fatal possession of Adela," she
                  observed, "and that she will stand at nothing to gratify it. You must see Charles
                  Cleveland, and get the truth out of him."
               "Better get it from Adela."
               "If you can. I doubt it."
               And Lady Grace had reason. When he spoke to his wife the following morning,
                  telling her the notes had been traced to her, she haughtily waved her hands at him
                  for silence, stopped her ears, and finally left his presence, declaring she would
                  not re-enter it until he could drop all allusion to the subject.
               With a half curse—he, so temperate a man!—Mr. Grubb started for Newgate, and from
                  thence came back, and called at Lady Oakton's. The countess and her daughters were
                  surrounded with visitors; Lady Mary Cleveland was exhibiting her baby to them. Mr.
                  Grubb made a sign to Lady Grace, and she went with him to another room.
               "Grace, what's to be done?" he said. "Adela will not hear a word, and I can make
                  nothing of Charles Cleveland. Upon my mentioning Lady Adela—of course only in
                  hints, I could not accuse my wife outright to him—he interrupted me with a request
                  that I would not introduce Lady Adela's name into so painful a matter; that he had
                  brought the disgrace upon himself, and was prepared to pay for it. I don't know
                  what to think. I cannot believe, if my wife were guilty, that Cleveland would take
                  the penalty upon himself. Transportation for life is no light matter, Grace."
               Lady Grace shuddered. "Do not let him suffer it," she said.
               "I would rather cut off my right hand than punish a man unjustly, were he my
                  greatest enemy. But unless I can get at the truth of this matter, and find proof
                  that your view of it is correct, I shall have no plea, to my partner, to the
                  public, or to my own conscience, for hushing it up; and the law must take its
                  course."
               "Alas! alas!" murmured Lady Grace.
               "You seem to overlook my feelings in this affair, Grace," he whispered, a deep hue
                  dyeing his cheeks. "That she must have had something to do with it, her paying
                  away the notes proves; and to find the wife of your bosom thus in league with
                  another——. You don't know what it is, Grace."
               "I can imagine it," she answered, the tears standing in her eyes as she rose to
                  bid him adieu. "Believe me, you have, and always have had, my deepest and truest
                  sympathy; but Adela is my sister; what more can I say?"
               Lady Grace sat on, alone. The murmur of gay voices came to her from the adjacent
                  room, but she heeded it not. She leaned her head upon her hand, and debated with
                  herself. It was imperative that the real facts of the case should be brought to
                  light; for if Charles Cleveland were permitted to suffer the penalty of
                  transportation, and it came out, later, that he was innocent, and her sister the
                  guilty party, what a fearful position would be that of Lady Adela!
               
               Could Charley not be brought to confess through stratagem? debated Lady Grace.
                  Suppose they made believe that Adela, in order to save him, had declared the
                  truth, then he might speak. It was surely a good idea. Grace weighed
                  it, in all its bearings, and determined to carry it out. But to whom intrust so
                  delicate a mission? Not to Mr. Cleveland, he would betray it all to Charles at the
                  first sentence; not to Mr. Grubb, his high sense of honor would never let him
                  assert that Lady Adela had confessed what she had not; not to Lady Mary, for her
                  only idea of Newgate was that it was a place overflowing with infectious fevers,
                  which she should inevitably bring home to baby. Who next? Herself?
                  Yes, for Grace Chenevix felt that none were so fitted for the task as she was—she
                  who had the subject so much at heart. So she made a confidante of her mother, and
                  the day for the expedition was fixed.
               Charles Cleveland sat on his iron bedstead, in his dreary cell, chewing the cud of
                  his reflections, which came crowding one upon another. None of them were
                  agreeable, as may be imagined, but pressing most keenly of all, was one sensation
                  of deep, dark disappointment. Above the discomfort of his present position, above
                  the sense of shame endured, above the dread of the hard, degrading life that
                  loomed for him in the future, was the unkind neglect of the Lady Adela. She, for
                  whom he was bearing this misery and disgrace, had never, by her presence, by
                  letter, or by message, sought to convey a ray of sympathy to cheer him in his
                  dungeon. It may be she was afraid, but it told not the less bitterly on the spirit
                  of the prisoner.
               A noise at his cell door, the heavy key was turning in the lock, and the prisoner
                  looked up eagerly—a visit was such a break in his dreary day. Two ladies were
                  entering, and his heart beat wildly—wildly; for in the form of one he discerned a
                  likeness to Lady Adela. Had she come to see him! and he had been so
                  ungratefully blaming her! But the lady raised her veil, and he was recalled to his
                  sober senses. It was only Grace Chenevix.
               "So, Charles, an awful scrape you have brought yourself into, through your
                  flirting nonsense with Adela!" began the Countess of Oakton.
               "Now, mamma, dear mamma," implored Lady Grace, in a whisper, "if you interfere you
                  will ruin all."
               "Ruin all! much obliged to you, Grace. I think he has ruined himself," retorted
                  the countess, in a shrill tone. "I wonder, Charles, you can look us in the face.
                  If any one had told me I should ever walk through Newgate, surrounded by turnkeys!
                  We came in a hack cab! I wouldn't have brought the servants here for the
                  world."
               "I shall ever feel grateful to you," began Charles.
               "Oh, never mind about gratitude," unceremoniously interrupted Lady Oakton,
                  "there's no time for it. Let us say what we have to say, Grace, and be gone. I am
                  all in a tremor, lest those men with keys should come and lock me up. Of course,
                  Charles, you know it has all come out."
               Charles looked up sharply.
               "Which is more luck than you could have expected," added the countess, while Lady
                  Grace sat on thorns, unable to get a word in edgeways. "Of all brainless idiots,
                  you have come out the first. If Adela chose (like a thoughtless, wicked girl as
                  she is! though she is my daughter) to write her husband's name to a cheque, was
                  that a reason why you should go hotheaded to work, and make believe you did it?
                  Grubb is not your husband, and you have no right to his money. Things that the law
                  will permit a wife to do with impunity, you might be run up to the drop for."
               "Who has been saying this?" uttered the prisoner, in breathless bewilderment.
                  "Surely not Lady Adela."
               
               "Charles," interposed Lady Grace, and her quiet tones, after those of the
                  countess, sounded like the lulling of a storm, "there is no necessity for further
                  mystery, or for your continuing to assume the guilt; which, as my mother says, was
                  an unwise step on your part——"
               "I did not say unwise," sharply interrupted the countess; "call things by their
                  right names, Lady Grace. It was insanity, and nobody but an idiot would have done
                  it. That's what I said."
               "The circumstances are known to us now," went on Lady Grace. "Poor Adela, at her
                  wits' end for money, drew the cheque, and sent you to cash it. And then, terrified
                  at what she had done, persuaded you to assume the guilt."
               "She did not persuade me," retorted Charles, falling completely into the snare,
                  and still anxious to excuse Lady Adela; "I volunteered to bear it; and I would do
                  as much again."
               "Charles, if you were present when she wrote the cheque—I did not inquire, and
                  Adela did not say—you were doubly to blame. She, poor thing, was excited at the
                  moment, and incapable of reflection, but you ought to have reasoned with her, and
                  refused to aid in it—for her own sake."
               "And of course I should," eagerly answered Mr. Charles, "had I known there was
                  anything wrong about it. She brought me the cheque ready written——"
               "When you went up from the city for the cheque-book, on the Saturday morning.
                  Yes?"
               "Yes. I declare I thought it was Mr. Grubb's writing, if ever I saw his writing in
                  my life. I was not likely to think anything else, having no suspicion. And I knew
                  nothing more about it till the Monday night, when I came up from Brighton—as I
                  suppose Lady Adela has told you, if she has told you the rest."
               "And then you undertook to shield her," interposed Lady Oakton, "and a glorious
                  mess you have made of it between you. Grace, how you worry; you can speak when I
                  have done. What she did would have been hushed up by Mr. Grubb, for
                  all our sakes, but what you did was a different matter. And now the disgrace has
                  been blazoned forth to every corner of the United Kingdom."
               "And these are all the thanks I get," remarked Charles, striving to speak
                  lightly.
               "What others would you like?" questioned the countess; "a service of plate
                  presented to you? You deserve it, I think, to have run your head into a noose for
                  a married woman. And Adela, of all others, who cares for nobody on earth but her
                  blessed self! Not she."
               "My mother is right," said Lady Grace, "and it may be as well, Charles, that you
                  should know it. Adela has never cared for you more than for another. If you have
                  given undue love to her—which you ought not to have done—it has been thrown away.
                     I tell it you."
               He bit his dry and fevered lips with mortification—fevered for
                  her—and the countess hurried Lady Grace away.
               "A capital success we have met with, Gracie," she cried, when they got outside the
                  stone walls, "but it's all thanks to me. I got it out of him nicely—like a green
                  seagull as he is. But, Grace, my child"—and Lady Oakton's voice grew hushed and
                  solemn—"what in the world will be done with Adela?"
               What indeed! Lady Oakton soon knew.
               That which the insults, the scorn of years, had failed to effect on Mr. Grubb's
                  heart was now accomplished. From the hour of his enlightenment he was a changed
                  man: his consideration for her had become contempt—his love hatred. Not with her
                  did he enter into negotiations for their
                  SEPARATION, but with her parents. The merchant proposed to allow her a liberal
                  maintenance, and the earl and countess agreed to receive her back in her maiden
                  home. The scene which ensued between her and her husband, when the news of his
                  fiat had burst startlingly upon her, was more humiliating to her than any she had
                  hitherto held part in. For she was kneeling to him in her terror and
                  distress, kneeling to supplicate his mercy. Lady Adela, so alive to the opinion of
                  the world, would almost have preferred death, than that her husband should condemn
                  her to a forced separation.
               "I have been very wrong," she implored, the tears streaming down her cheeks; "I
                  have not behaved as I ought from the time of our marriage; I acknowledge it.
                  Forgive me what is past, and in future I will be all that a wife ought."
               "Do not humiliate yourself by kneeling to me, Lady Adela,"—and his tone had no
                  relenting in it. "I pray you rise."
               "Not till you say you forgive me," was her rejoinder, clasping his knees, and
                  laying her tearful face against them. "Do not let me kneel to you in vain—my
                     husband."
               "Lady Adela, but a short while ago it was my turn to supplicate you. I told you I
                  would protect, forgive, and shield you. I solemnly prayed you to trust in me—your
                     husband—as you wished it to be well with us in our future life. Do
                  you remember your answer?"
               She moaned aloud—her only answer now.
               "As you rejected me, so must I reject you."
               "I will give up play—I will be all you wish—a man may not reject his
                  wife," she wildly urged.
               "He may—when he has sufficient reason. Look at all you have dealt to me. Few men
                  would have borne with you as I have done. I loved you with a true and lasting
                  love: how have you repaid it to me?"
               "Try me once again—a month—a week—let me still live on, your wife. I will indeed
                  be all you wish. Only try me."
               "It may not be," he coldly said. "My resolution has been deliberately taken, and I
                  cannot change it on impulse."
               "Later, then," she panted, "try me later. Oh! mercy! mercy!"
               "Neither now nor later. My feelings were long, long outraged, and I bore with you;
                  but, in this last fearful act, you have broken all allegiance, and thrown off my
                  protection. Lady Adela, I shall never inhabit the same roof with you again."
               She continued her distressing appeal—"Mercy! mercy!" But her once fond husband
                  gently unwound the clasp of her arms, laid her on a sofa, and escaped from the
                  room and the house. He did not enter it again until she had finally left it.
               When the day of Charles Cleveland's trial came, there was no prosecutor, so he was
                  discharged. No explanation had been given to Charley's friends in the fashionable
                  world, but an understanding had somehow gone forth among them, coupled with a
                  curious whisper about Lady Adela, that he was not guilty and had been wrongfully
                  accused. They received him with a noisy welcome, each one contesting who should
                  make the most of him.
               But Charles Cleveland was a changed man. His confinement and reflections in
                  Newgate had added years to his experience in life, and the heartless conduct of
                  Lady Adela filled his soul with wrath and bitterness. For heartless as she had
                  been to him in prison, so she remained in the interview which he sought with her,
                  after he came out of it.
               
               "What name do you now give to that devoted chivalry of yours, Charles?" asked Lady
                  Grace Chenevix, with a smile, when she was bidding him adieu, the day of his
                  departure for Marseilles, a post in the civil service at Bombay having been
                  obtained for him.
               "INFATUATION," replied Mr. Charles, savagely.
               "That was just it," said Lady Grace. "Take care of yourself for the future."
               "If ever I get trapped by a woman again, all courtly smiles one day, when she
                  wants her turn served, and careless neglect the next, like a confounded
                  weathercock, I'll give you leave to transport me in earnest," was Charley's
                  wrathful answer. "But God bless you, Grace," he added, changing his
                  tone to one of deep feeling, "for I owe it to you, and not to her, that I am not
                  now on my free passage to Norfolk Island."
               And the Lady Adela? She is an unhappy woman, dragging on a discontented existence
                  under her father's roof, wishing, how vainly, that she had not forfeited her
                  married home. We never know the value of a thing till we have lost
                  it. Strange to say, that feeling of admiration and esteem, which others
                  felt for her husband, has now been awakened in her own breast, and she would
                  forfeit half her remaining existence to be allowed to return to him and atone for
                  days gone by. But she knows that this can never be; that they shall not be united
                  on this side the grave; that when her husband threw her off, he threw her off for
                  ever.
            
            
               An Ordeal.
               THE fire burnt cheerily, throwing a ruddy light over the walls of the little room,
                  with its one or two prints in simple frames, its hanging book-shelf, and its ebony
                  clock. The round table was drawn close to the fire, and on it the tea-things
                  glistened, and the lamp stood ready for lighting. Agnes Ross sat with her feet on
                  the fender, knitting by fire-light, expecting, not waiting—he was always too
                  punctual for that—to hear her brother's step outside, and the familiar click of
                  his key in the street-door, as he let himself in. It was a London lodging, in one
                  of those quiet streets that appear like the very strong-holds of dreariness and
                  discomfort; but, for all that, it was a home, and looked like a home, too, to the
                  orphaned brother and sister.
               That was his step! Agnes rose quickly, set on the kettle, and lit the lamp. Then,
                  with an air of careful pride, she took from the mantel-shelf a glass jar in which
                  was a bouquet of glowing, beautiful, green-house flowers, rich with aromatic
                  fragrance. It seemed strange on the table where she placed it, surrounded by the
                  homely ware of the tea-service. The bunch of winter-violets, which she removed to make room for the others, had been far
                  more appropriate. But Agnes' face shone as she looked on her floral treasures, and
                  then watched for her brother's expression as he saw them.
               He did see them, as he came into the room. He paused—then shut the door—then
                  smiled back in answer to his sister's delighted glance.
               "Yes, Leonard. What do you think of this?"
               She held them up, glass jar and all, for admiration. "Where do you think these
                  came from?"
               The young man did not answer at first. He took the flowers from her hand, looked
                  at them, breathed in their fragrance for a minute, then put them down again. The
                  flush of pleasure soon passed from his thoughtful face. He sat down, looking even
                  grave.
               "Who do you think brought them?" persisted Agnes, changing the form of
                  question.
               "I can guess," he answered. A very brief pause; then he added, "Miss Bellew has
                  been to see you. She said she would. How do you like her?"
               "Very, very much," cried Agnes, enthusiastically, "How beautiful she is, Leonard.
                  You told me she was, but you did not say half enough. And so gentle, and kind, and
                  sweet. I fancied she was proud."
               "So she is," Leonard said quickly; "but with a pride too lofty to show itself to
                  those below her in wealth and position." He moved to take from his sister's hands
                  the kettle she was lifting. Tea-making engrossed her attention for a little while,
                  but she soon returned to the former theme.
               "She sat and talked; pleasant, friendly chat; for nearly an hour. I showed her my
                  drawings, and yours, afterwards. She praised mine very much, but I think she would
                  not venture to praise yours. I showed her our old house and the views all about,
                  that you took."
               "Little simpleton! To suppose every one as interested in the dear old place as
                  ourselves."
               "I am sure she was interested, Leonard. Of course, not as we are, but still very
                  much. Is it likely she would not be, knowing you? Then I showed her your German
                  drawings. She found out for herself that Swiss view hanging by the window, and
                  liked it. Generally, I hate to hear people praise your drawings or yourself, even.
                  But I would allow Miss Bellew to praise both."
               "Gracious permission! Now, terrible autocrat, give me my tea. It is the bleakest
                  of November nights, outside. In this cosy little nest we feel nothing of it. Cosy
                  little nest; dear little bird in the nest."
               But in spite of his gay, loving tone, he seemed more than usually tired this
                  evening. The dark hair fell carelessly, even rudely, over his forehead—the calm
                  forehead that his little sister was so proud of. She smoothed away the vagrant
                  locks; her cool fingers were very sweet, welcome visitants to his hot brow.
               "Does your head ache, Leonard?"
               "A little."
               "And I have been chattering away so thoughtlessly. Drink your tea, brother, and
                  keep quiet. I will be still as a mouse."
               "No need, Agnes. I am only tired; that's all. It has been rather a busy day. Mr.
                  Bellew had some involved accounts from a Dresden house, which I had to go through,
                  because I know German. And——it was more fatiguing than reading Schiller."
               "Yes, indeed!" Agnes said seriously. She sat on her little chair; and, supporting
                  her chin with her hand, gazed meditatively into the fire.
               "But, for all that, it was pleasant enough," pursued Leonard cheerfully—"pleasant to be able to render a
                  special service to my master."
               "Your master!" Scornfully curled the red lip. But the pride of even a good woman
                  often flies nearer the ground than that of a good man. Leonard smiled.
               "Do not disown the word, nor the fact, my birdie. It is no shame to be a
                  servant—or a servant I should not be."
               Agnes broke forth anew with earnestness, even to tears.
               "Oh, Leonard! Don't be angry: I mean, don't be vexed with me for feeling—feeling
                  it so hard that I should be the cause of all."
               "The cause of all? Of what?"
               "Of your being in this position. If it had not been for me, you would have gone to
                  India, as your uncle wished; and you would have made your fortune, and come back
                  to England while you were young; and you would have married and been happy."
               She stopped at length her rapid, passionate utterance. Leonard then spoke
                  gently.
               "Happy! My little sister, what is it that you call happiness?"
               "Oh, I know—I know, with you duty is always happiness."
               "Not always; not often, I am afraid, to this restless, erring humanity which is so
                  strong within all of us. But, Agnes, there was no war between duty and inclination
                  in my case. If it had not been simply right to stay at home, and be a brother
                  otherwise than in name to my sister, I might have done it from pure selfishness.
                  Next spring, you know, when I lose my little sister, I may yet go to India."
               "Oh, Leonard!"
               "Oh, Agnes!" He laughed at her the pleasant laugh of one who loves too truly to be
                  less than tender over the foibles of the beloved. "All this time, while you are
                  eloquent quent and unreasonable, my tea is getting cold, and so is yours."
               Agnes turned slowly round to the tea-table. Her face, in its intent
                  thoughtfulness, looked like her brother's for the time, though she was a
                  youthful-hearted woman of four-and-twenty, and he a man of thirty: old-looking for
                  his years.
               "But, for all that"—she again plunged into the forbidden subject—"I am not
                  convinced, brother."
               "Not convinced, of what?"
               "That you would not have been happier, making your way abroad. It was such a
                  prospect!"
               "Spoken like a man of business. But life has other phases than commerce. I was
                  never meant to be a homeless seeker for fortune. I crave more nourishment for
                  heart and mind. As for riches and luxury, I want none of them. I never used to
                  wish for them: I never will!"
               His tone grew determined. Agnes looked up surprised, but more persuaded.
               "And you are really happy here, and thus?"
               "Happier than I could be anywhere else in the wide world," he answered, with a
                  fervor that sent the color to his cheek, the light to his eyes. His sister looked
                  up into his face, and was satisfied.
               The table cleared, Agnes was soon at work. But before Leonard unclosed Shakspeare
                  to finish The Tempest, commenced the previous evening, the girlish,
                  busy tongue began again on the fruitful theme with which their evening talk had
                  commenced.
               "Brother, Miss Bellew invited me to go and see her."
               "Did she? Very naturally."
               "What sort of a house is it?"
               "Their villa is a perfect palace of taste and luxury. You were never in such a
                  grand house in your life, Agnes. Mr.
                  Bellew is one of our merchant princes, you know. He likes magnificence, and his
                  house——"
               "It is about Mr. Bellew I want to know, not his house. Is he a nice man?"
               "Nice is such a young lady's word, I am afraid of venturing in its
                  way. He is a handsome old man, to begin with. His face expresses the qualities I
                  have always found in him—honor, integrity, straightforward truthfulness,
                  perseverance, pride, and inflexible, inexorable will."
               "I know what he is like, very well. Is Miss Bellew an only child?"
               "She has a brother, a boy of fourteen; and two little sisters, born when her
                  mother died."
               "And she is a mother to them?"
               "Almost," said Leonard, temperately. "She is very good—very loving and tender over
                  them. Her mother left them in her charge. She fulfils it sacredly."
               "And they all love her dearly?"
               "I believe so: the little girls do, at least. Master Alfred is, I should think,
                  rather difficult to deal with. His father has spoiled him ever since he was
                  born."
               "And neglects, or at least thinks little of his daughters?"
               "Not so fast. Rosamond—Miss Bellew—is the very apple of her father's eye."
               "Is she?" said Agnes, thoughtfully.
               Leonard opened his book, and began turning over the pages.
               "And her name is Rosamond," she pursued, still musing, her work lying idle in her
                  lap. "Rosa mundi, Rose of the World."
               "Even so," said Leonard, gently, "Rose of the World." He repeated the words
                  softly, dreamily, as he turned over more pages, and finally settled his volume and
                  himself for reading. Then his voice became cadenced to a clear and equable music,
                  as he began: 
                     
                        "There be some sports are painful; but their labor
                        Delight in them sets off."
                     
                  
               
               A week afterwards, Agnes went to spend the day with Miss Bellew. It was looked
                  forward to, thought about, counted upon. It proved one of those rare occasions
                  when the anticipated pleasure falls even short of its reality. At least, so Agnes
                  thought, when, after a long day that had seemed short, of talk and music, books
                  and work, she and Miss Bellew and the children sat at evening in the drawing-room,
                  with Mr. Bellew asleep in his arm-chair. The two little girls were at their
                  sister's feet, absorbed in a fairy-tale. Master Alfred was equally well amused by
                  some boyish piece of science which his father had brought him that evening.
                  Rosamond and Agnes sat side by side on the sofa. The night was bleak—rain falling,
                  and gusts of wind sobbing which reached their ears even in their curtained and
                  cushioned splendor of ease.
               "My brother will be here soon," said Agnes.
               "Yes. It is a wild night for him to come so far."
               "Oh! he does not mind wild weather. He even likes it. At home, he often used to go
                  out in the midst of storm and wind, to help the fishermen to draw up their boats
                  on the shore. Once he went into a little boat to save the people out of a
                  wreck."
               "Did he?"
               A silence. Curiously enough, this theme of Leonard was a new one between the two
                  girls, although to one of them, at least, of ever-present interest.
               "You must have loved your home very much," said Miss Bellew presently.
               "We did—especially Leonard. He looked as I never saw him look before nor since, when we drove away
                  from the gate of our house, and through the village. It was such a happy home.
                  Perhaps, one day, we may yet have it again."
               "You and your brother?"
               "Yes; or Leonard, at least. I know he hopes for it, thinks of it,
                  determines"——
               But here Agnes stopped, suddenly conscious how unwittingly confidential she had
                  become with her new friend. She looked up, and Rosamond's eyes met her own. Miss
                  Bellew's was a face that looked too proud for a woman's, until she smiled or
                  spoke; then the curves of her mouth relaxed into a graciousness that made her
                  whole countenance radiant and beautiful. Now the face was softened into absolute
                  sweetness. Agnes thought it so lovely at that moment, she could not choose but
                  look at it; she could not choose but feel it familiar, and her confidence no
                  longer seemed unnatural. Nevertheless, she paused.
               "You are not afraid of talking to me?" said Rosamond, simply. "Tell me more of
                  your old home. I know you must like to talk of it, and I like to listen."
               And so Agnes went on talking, and Rosamond listened.
               It was natural that the sister should insensibly slide back to the subject of her
                  brother. Agnes found herself telling Miss Bellew of all the circumstances of their
                  position. True, none needed to be kept secret, and most of them Rosamond might
                  already have learned from her father. Perhaps she had. However that might be, she
                  kept very still, while Agnes told her how the failure of a bank soon after their
                  father's death had ruined them, and how at first Leonard had tried to support his
                  mother and sister in their old home by teaching in the neighborhood.
               "But our mother died; and, soon after, an old friend of my father's offered
                  Leonard employment in translating, if he would come and live in London. So we left
                  the old place, and went to live in London lodgings."
               "It must have been a sad change."
               "In many respects it was. And then our rich uncle Fellows wrote to offer Leonard a
                  share in some great Indian concern of his. He had been unfriendly with the family
                  for years, but now he wrote. And when Leonard declined, he sent back an angry
                  letter, renouncing all connexion with him for ever."
               "Your brother declined?"
               "Yes. Shall I tell you why? You guess—he would not leave me. We two were alone in
                  the world then. I feel ungrateful sometimes."
               She paused, blushing.
               "Perhaps, when I am married, Leonard may go——"
               "To India?"
               "Yes. I often fancy he thinks of it. If it had not been for me, he might have made
                  his fortune there by this time. His useless, troublesome sister, who now, after
                  all, will leave him!" sighed Agnes, with a pensive look in her brown eyes.
               "You are to be married, then? Soon?"
               "In the spring, when his ship is expected home. He is a sailor," added she, with a
                  girlish flush and a rapid glance at her companion.
               "Is he? And will he have to go to sea again after you are married—to leave
                  you?"
               "No, indeed. I shall go with him wherever he goes. No need—no right—no reason that
                  I should ever leave him when I am his wife!" cried Agnes. "That is the
                  happiness!"
               Again she paused with a bright blush. Again Rosamond's eyes perused her face with
                  a kind of tender exultation in what she read there. Her lips parted, as if to
                     speak, but she checked the impulse,
                  and sat mute; her head a little drooped, her hands lightly clasped upon her
                  lap—musing, most likely.
               Leonard's eyes first fell on that fair picture as he entered the room; for the
                  door opened noiselessly—as all doors were educated to do in that house—and he
                  stood before them before they were aware. Both the girls started; both blushed.
                  Agnes smiled gladly on seeing her brother, Rosamond moved away to awaken her
                  father.
               Mr. Bellew became conversational. The children were summoned to bed, and tea-time
                  arrived.
               Rosamond presided over the tea-table. It was pleasant to see her at its duties,
                  all the surrounding appointments being, after their several ways, in graceful,
                  delicate, and refined harmony with herself. She said little, even to Agnes, who
                  sat by her side. She appeared entirely intent on the office before her: only an
                  occasional lighting up of the dark eyes, a radiant flow of color to the
                  transparent cheek, betrayed that she listened to the animated discourse between
                  the two gentlemen. Mr. Bellew liked talking with his clerk; he was too clever
                  himself not to value intellect in another; and it was not the first agreeable
                  evening he had owed to the society of Leonard Ross. The old gentleman was
                  intelligent, cultivated, in a certain sense, and sagacious. All his most genial
                  characteristics came out on such occasions. He paid studious little courtesies to
                  Agnes; he was kind and friendly beyond kindness to Leonard. As he leaned back in
                  his velvet chair, his fine head with its white hair, his clear blue eyes, his
                  well-cut features, made a pleasant picture of flourishing old age. All the harsher
                  points were lost, which sometimes made his hale countenance stern and hard of
                  aspect, even to cruelty.
               Agnes had thought of him even with affection; and of Rosamond her appreciation had
                  been warm even to enthusiasm siasm. "Had been," for things were changing now, and
                  the joy of the time seemed slipping away from Leonard's sister. The graceful
                  luxury of the surroundings satisfied her taste, attracted her fancy, as before.
                  Rosamond sat fair and brilliant, like a star shining in the midst of a cloud, or a
                  diamond set in snow—as Agnes had been thinking to herself. Leonard was there, too.
                  All was warmth; glowing, generous, cordial warmth. Yet Agnes felt chilled, and was
                  no longer at peace.
               The evening went by, and the time of departure drew near. Rosamond took Agnes to
                  her room. That exquisite little dressing-room had delighted Agnes a few hours
                  before. The rose-pink hangings; the mirrors with their marble consoles; the
                  statuettes, and pictures, and flowers, and porcelain; the birds in their cages;
                  the jewels and trinkets; the rare and costly trifles tossed lavishly about—all
                  this had pleased simple Agnes to see. Now, she marked the incongruity of her own
                  homely bonnet and cloak as they lay on the embroidered couch. Also, for the first
                  time, she noted the contrast between herself and her hostess as they were both
                  reflected in one of the long glasses.
               Rosamond took her hand.
               "Let us be friends," she said, with a certain hesitating timidity, very unusual to
                  Miss Bellew.
               A little while before Agnes would have responded warmly, lovingly. Now,
                  instinctively, she shrank back. But her next impulse forbade her to risk the
                  chance of giving pain.
               "I hope so," she answered, with gentleness.
               Rosamond kissed her, and she returned the kiss.
               Down the soft-carpeted staircase into the chastened glow of the drawing-room
                  again, with its purple and its gold, and its grandeur that was lost in the
                  refinement and grace that reigned over all. Good-night to the courtly,
                     white-haired gentleman who stood by
                  the hearth; good-night to the queen of the palace—the fairy of the enchanted
                  castle—the lily of the beautiful garden. Rosamond looked like all these as she
                  gave her hand, first to Agnes, then to Leonard. He touched it; glanced, not looked
                  into her face, and turned to answer some casual inquiry of Mr. Bellew. The bell
                  rang, the servant waited; the brother and sister descended the staircase. At its
                  foot they were arrested by Rosamond's voice.
               "Stay, Miss Ross! Agnes! you have forgotten your flowers."
               She came flying down to them, holding the beautiful camellias and geraniums
                  clasped to her breast. Leonard stood nearest to her; and before his will could
                  rise to control it, his impulse—passionate, imperious, overwhelming—had commanded
                  him to stretch out his hand. He took the flowers. He looked at her; and, for a
                  single instant, she looked at him.
               There was no second good-night. Agnes twined her arm within her brother's. They
                  were out in the cold, blank, silent night.
               The brother and sister walked rapidly. The rain had ceased, but a damp mist hung
                  over everything. The houses looked like great, gaunt shadows; the street-lamps
                  flared with a sickly, lurid light; the park they had to cross was a dreary
                  wilderness, haunted with strange shapes; for tree, and gate, and fence looked
                  ghostly in the vaporous air. Agnes shivered; her brother drew her closer to his
                  side.
               "Are you cold?" he asked anxiously. They were the first words he had spoken since
                  they left the house.
               "No; not cold."
               A pause.
               "You have had a pleasant day?'
               "It was very pleasant."
               Another silence.
               "How sweet these flowers are!"
               Agnes caught them from his hand.
               "I should like to throw them away!" she said, passionately.
               Leonard gently reclaimed them, saying nothing. He did not inquire the reason of
                  his sister's sudden emotion; although it had left her trembling, and, once or
                  twice, a brief, strong sob escaped from her. He said nothing.
               The narrow, dismal street was reached at last. They re-entered their home. The
                  fire shone with a subdued glow; two or three books lay on the table, Agnes's
                  work-basket, and the glass of flowers. Leonard lit the lamp, his sister sat on the
                  little sofa, and he took up a letter which had arrived in their absence. But he
                  only handled it mechanically; looked at it with eyes whose vision seemed
                  introverted. A strange expression was on his face; such as even his sister had
                  never seen there before. It was not the look she had expected—had dreaded to see.
                  That she could have interpreted; but this was in a language of which she held no
                  key. He took up the glowing flowers he had brought with him, and regarded them
                  long with deep, thoughtful eyes. Agnes sprang to him.
               "Oh! put them away—put them away!"
               He looked into her face. Her pleading, anguished look forced down the calm front
                  with which he strove to meet it. So he only took her in his arms, and gently
                  pressed her head against his shoulder, blinding the entreating eyes that saw too
                  much. Presently, in a quiet voice, he said,—
               "Yes, Agnes. I will put them away."
               In a changed tone, presently, he added:
               "You are tired, and it is late. We will not sit up longer."
               "O brother, brother! you are cruel to me."
               
               "Am I? Do I pain you—have I pained you, my poor birdie?"
               "Is it no pain to see you suffering; to know you miserable; and to be told no
                  more?" she cried, with the vehemence of her quick, impatient nature.
               He did not answer.
               "I thought I knew my brother's heart," she went on, "even as he knew mine. But I
                  was wrong—wrong. From the time we were little children, I thought we had shared
                  every trouble, every difficulty, every trial. I was proud, glad to think it. But
                  you have been in sorrow, and I never knew; you are unhappy now, and you try to put
                  me off with vague words."
               "Agnes! You are not right in this reproach. The confidence you claim ought not to
                  have been yours. Simple honesty would have held me dumb, if other feelings had
                  been insufficient. I had no right to indulge in the luxury of sympathy. I will not
                  have it now. I do not need it. Miserable I have not been: for I have done no
                  wrong. No, sister, nor will I do wrong,"—he pushed her gently from him,—his color
                  rose, his voice took a new tone,—"although I love her! I love her," he said, "
                  with all my strength; with all the yearning of my soul; although I am the one who
                  loves her and will love the truest—deepest—best; although all the world love her
                  too."
               He stopped abruptly, seated himself, and shaded his face with his hand.
               "You have heard," he said, almost sternly; "you have your wish now. You know your
                  brother's heart. If I hid it from you before it was not from shame. I am not
                  ashamed of loving Rosamond Bellew. I will carry my love for her, with my hope for
                  heaven, to the grave; pure and spotless, God helping me. And the life he gave me
                  shall not be less worthy, even if it be less happy, because of the love."
               "Oh, brother, brother!" Agnes sobbed, clinging round his neck, "I cannot bear it;
                  I, that am so happy, to see you suffer."
               "My child, I know it is hard," he said, tenderly; "God bless you for the love that
                  makes it so."
               "Every day, every time you see her, that you go there"——
               "I know. Therefore, when my little bird leaves me for her own happy nest next
                  spring, I shall go."
               "Where?"
               "Abroad somewhere. I shall easily settle where. In the meantime, I shall not go
                  there again." His glance unconsciously caught the flowers that lay near him for a
                  single instant. He rose resolvedly.
               "Now, remember, no word henceforward." He kissed her fondly, then led her gently,
                  but irresistibly, to the door.
               "You must go to bed now. Good-night, sister."
               "Good-night, brother." But she lingered yet a few minutes—then she went.
               Left alone, Leonard Ross stood beside the fire-place, leaning his head against the
                  high mantelpiece. His hands clasped themselves together very tightly; the one
                  instinctive, unconscious demonstration of rending pain.
               It was a new pain, and one so mingled with sweetness that it defied him to put it
                  away. For a brief space he had tasted of a joy most exquisite;—for once at least
                  his life had risen to full tide, and joy had crowned it with a crest of light.
                  There is no man who loves, and sees for the first time the answering electric
                  look, which at a flash shows him a new world radiant and glorious; into which he
                  alone may enter; over which he alone holds sovereignty—there is no man, beholding
                  this, but would feel the rapture of the new joy. Leonard had tasted of the
                  ecstasy; now came the recoil. The gate of
                  the dream-land had closed upon him, and he stood in the cold, grey, outside world
                  again.
               In that grey reality, truths now made themselves harshly felt. That he was not
                  alone in this love, that it was requited, soon ceased to be a thought of
                  sweetness; it aggravated to torture, it lashed even to fierceness. For the first
                  time the cry of his soul was, "It is more than I can bear."
               Such strife, such struggle it is for no earthly hand to record. Let no man be
                  ashamed if, in his calmer latter days, he look back to some such episode in his
                  early life. Over it, be sure, angel eyes have watched with divine compassion for
                  the suffering, divine exultation in the victory.
               In the morning Agnes came down, with looks well tutored into cheerfulness. Her
                  brother stood by the window, an open letter in his hand. He was very pale, she
                  thought to herself. He kissed her as usual, then held her hand still.
               "Agnes," said he, in a low voice, "I have only now just opened this letter."
               "It was here last night. Oh, Leonard, no bad news?"
               "Uncle Fellows is dead."
               "Dead—Uncle Fellows!" A sudden flash of thought made her heart beat quickly,
                  almost to suffocation. She looked up in her brother's face.
               "There is no will, and I am the heir-at-law."
               
               A fortnight had gone by. What a new-hued time was this! What a wondrous world
                  revolved within the circle of the old one! New life—new air—new warmth, light, and
                  lustre—although the days were shortening towards the year's end, and sullen clouds
                  hid constantly the vault of heaven, and sunshine came not through, and earth grew
                  cold in the shadow.
               Leonard Ross was betrothed to Rosamond Bellew. Her father was surprised, at
                  first:—acute perceptions do not always accompany a shrewd intellect, and the
                  merchant might have gone on not seeing that which was before his eyes, to the end
                  of his days. He was surprised, and at first scarcely pleased, perhaps. His clerk
                  suddenly transformed into a millionaire was an idea that he could not at once get
                  accustomed to. That the millionaire should become his son-in-law was more easy of
                  acceptance. Still it was all very strange. He was confounded, too, by his
                  daughter's frank, almost proud, avowal of her love for Leonard. Of course, no
                  objections could be urged: he gave his consent. But it was some time before he
                  grew easy under the new state of things. It was curious; puzzling; perplexing, he
                  thought, that Leonard Ross should be a rich man—able to marry his daughter.
               To Rosamond and Leonard it never seemed strange or new. They were very happy. That
                  golden fortnight had held for them riches enough to dower many a long life.
                  Existence is more evenly balanced than we think. Perhaps we all drink nectar
                  sometimes; only to some it comes drop by drop, sweetening the daily draught; while
                  others quaff it from the full goblet in one draught, and live, thereafter, on the
                  remembered glory.
               At the fortnight's end Leonard was to go down to Blishford, the large town near
                  which his property lay, and where his uncle had died, to take possession of the
                  estate, and to arrange various legal matters in connexion, not only with it, but
                  with his approaching marriage. Two weddings would take place early in the spring.
                  Agnes was to be claimed by her sailor lover, who would then return from the West
                  Indies, and Rosamond and Leonard were to be married at the same time. The fond
                  dream of many, many years was to be realized; and the birthplace of Leonard was to
                  be the dear home to which he would take
                  his bride. He described it to her again and again, and sketched faithful vignettes
                  of well remembered places on stray scraps of paper, all of which she kept and
                  treasured as the costliest works of art. She listened, never tired—asking question
                  upon question with the persistency of an interest that never could be exhausted,
                  for it arose out of a depth of tenderness that could never be fathomed.
               But—at the fortnight's end, Leonard was to go. The time came, and he went. Only
                  for a week—a week would suffice for everything, and he was to be back at
                  Christmas-time. It was scarcely like a parting, Rosamond said; although her lip
                  quivered like a grieved child's, and her eyes shone through large tears she tried
                  hard to conceal.
               Nevertheless, whether at first or at last, separation brings with it the
                  inevitable penalty of suffering, and love will not be constrained into submission.
                  So Rosamond ran into her little fairy bower and could not be won thence, even by
                  Agnes; who, it had been planned, was to stay with her during Leonard's absence,
                  and who would fain have soothed the passionate grief away.
               Meanwhile Leonard pursued his journey; thoughts, memories, and hopes, thronging
                  his brain: new feelings and old, stirring at his heart. Verily, there can be few
                  things 
                     
                        "Sweeter than the dream,
                        Dreamed by a happy man."
                     
                  
               
               Great resolves mixed themselves with those happy hopes; ardent yearnings for the
                  future, yearnings in which self was the beginning but not the end of
                  aspiration.
               So he went on his way—through the long railway journey, to the great, looming,
                  London-like town near which was his destination. Business, now, grows thick upon
                  him—we may leave him for awhile:
               We may leave him sitting in the old oak-panelled parlor lor, with its quaint
                  furniture, its massive chairs and table, and carved bureau; the room that had been
                  his uncle's study, and where, as the grave housekeeper informs him, her master
                  transacted all his business. Large and various must that business have been. The
                  management of the huge property, which chiefly consisted of houses in Blishford,
                  was only part of it. He still kept up his connexion with the merchant's house in
                  Calcutta wherein he had originally made his fortune; he had large speculations
                  afloat, grand schemes, even at the very time of his death—when paralysis cut short
                  in one instant all the old man's hopes and ambitions for ever. Leonard, during the
                  days he passed in that old house, thought often with much marvelling as to the
                  manner of man his unknown uncle had been. He asked many questions of the demure
                  housekeeper.
               "He was a hard gentleman, sir, though I say it. Many a time, in the bad winters,
                  with fever about, and half Blishford a'most driven to famine, he's been begged of
                  for money to help the poor; and he, out of all his wealth, would never give a
                  fraction. And his poor tenants in some o' them miserable courts and places—where a
                  body hardly likes to go, they're so foul and wretched—if in the worst of times
                  they were backward with their rent, it fared sorely with them."
               Leonard heard and mused within himself, gravely and sadly, for a long time, as he
                  pursued his task of examining the papers, letters, deeds, and memoranda, which had
                  been kept for the heir's arrival, with the lawyer's seal affixed upon the locks of
                  the drawers which held them.
               So, in the old oak-panelled parlor, with the bronze lamp shedding a flickering
                  light on the carved bureau, and the thoughtful face bent over it, with the
                  firelight glowing in the wide grate, and the polished walls shining with a dark
                  resplendence,—we leave him until to-morrow.
               
               A wintry night in the outskirts of London, snow on the ground; deep already, and
                  deepening at every moment. The air is thick with large flakes that fall noiseless
                  on road and pavement, on house roof and church steeple, on pillared porch and
                  garden wall. It was bitterly cold. The snow that had fallen was not soft, but
                  frozen into a cruel hardness. Footsteps left hardly any imprint in it, and the
                  track of wheels and horses' hoofs that the day's traffic had left had been long
                  since effaced, and no new vehicles came down the quiet district to renew them.
                  Houses, houses, houses on all sides, but jealously closed; only a hall lamp
                  shining at rare intervals through a fanlight. No cheerful glow came through
                  crimson curtains, a generous contingent from some warm cosy nest to the bleak,
                  bare, outside night. All without is silent, blank, chill. What is it
                     within one of these "handsome houses, where the wealthy" City men
                  and merchants dwell? For this is a suburb of "first-class villa residences."
               Through the blinding snow, through the relentless biting cold, a gentleman who,
                  having newly emerged from a neighboring omnibus, afforded a black relief to the
                  unmitigated pallor of surrounding things, dashed on, very quickly and
                  determinedly. His color was fast changing, however, first to iron grey, then to
                  pepper and salt, and finally to salt by itself. He reached his destination, rang
                  at the bell, as he entered by a wide gate into what, under its white masquerade
                  dress, seemed to be a garden and shrubberies: then sprang up some steps, knocked
                  loudly at a door whose massive oak and awful knobs even the snow had respected,
                  and shook himself free from the cloudy flakes that covered him. One more look out
                  into the forbidding night; one more instinctive shiver and shrinking from the rude
                  gust that came, with snow for its ally, right in his face. Then the door flew open
                  and he stepped in. The massive portal closed behind him. Where was the harsh night
                  gone? What had become of the incarnate dreariness? the black vault above? the
                  lurid desolation of the world below?
               Here was a wide hall, well lit by two swinging lamps of painted glass, that looked
                  like ripe summer fruits hanging from a garden wall; pictures rich and warm in
                  color; and one or two statues. A fair white Welcome stood on one side, holding out
                  her hands and smiling with her lip, her eyes, her brow, with every curve of her
                  gracious face and figure; and a Peace, not needing to smile, her look was so
                  serene, with her arms folded purely over the book she held to her breast, and her
                  olive-wreath changed for one of Christmas holly, red-berried, shining-leaved, that
                  another hand than the sculptor's had placed there. Evergreens decked the walls,
                  the picture-frames, the lamps;—and the fragrance of bay-leaves scented the warm
                  air. The newly-arrived guest looked round; as if with dazzled eyes, he passed his
                  hand across his brow, while the servant relieved him of his hat and his cloak. And
                  now, sound begins to add itself to the other accompaniments of the scene; a warm
                  happy murmur of voices, through which, presently, a light, tremulous, girlish
                  laugh is embroidered like a silver thread on crimson. And then some cunning hand
                  evokes a passionate flood of sound from the pianoforte; it rises, it sinks, and
                  swells, and rises again, and falls in tiny crystal droplets, and then ceases. For
                  the dining-room door has been opened, and our sometime wayfarer in the snow has
                  entered.
               A large room, glowing warmly with crimson, and opening into a smaller one, beyond
                  which again the faint light of a pendant lamp reveals a tiny conservatory. They
                  are seated round the blazing fire in the first room, all but the one who stands by
                  the piano—her white fingers yet poised over the ivory keys. A hale, handsome old
                  man, two little girls nestling on the hearth-rug, very fairy princesses, of
                     blue eyes, golden hair, and dainty
                  apparel; an older boy poring over a book, and bright-faced Agnes Ross, her look
                  alert and flashing, her whole countenance radiant and happy, seated on the sofa,
                  the other place on which has been just vacated by Rosamond.
               O happiest Rosamond! She looked up and saw the figure standing in the doorway.
               "Leonard! Oh, I knew it was you."
               They gathered round him: his sister, with a fond embrace; the children, in much
                  demonstrative glee; even slow-moving Mr. Bellew rose from his chair, and met him
                  with outstretched hand.
               "The train was late," he observed, as he seated himself. "Delayed one hour by the
                  great snows." Agnes made Leonard take her place. He sat beside Rosamond on the
                  sofa, and then his sister attacked him volubly with inquiries as to how he
                  travelled? was he tired? had he dined? But, the questions answered, he leaned
                  back, glad to be silent, perhaps. The picture was complete. Laughing children, the
                  sweep of soft, rich drapery, the pearl-like light of lamps, the cordial sound of
                  the flaming fire, and the sweet, luscious odors that stole in from the neighboring
                  flowers: luxurious allurements and gratifications for the senses, refined and
                  subtle as the tastes they wooed and won—all were here.
               Leonard again passed his hand over his brow.
               "Dearest, you are tired," whispered Rosamond, bending close to him in sweet,
                  sudden anxiety. Her hand timidly touched his shoulder. He took it in his own, and
                  looked at it; the fair, soft, little hand, the delicate wrist, well guarded by its
                  outer sleeve of purple silk, and within that, drooping frills of finest lace, and
                  a shining bracelet of gold, thickly set with emeralds, clasped about it, and ever
                  and anon slipping up the round arm. Fair little hand!
               Leonard looked at it; then at her sweet face, where a faint flush was gathering
                  and fading, and then glowing again, like sunrays upon snow. Then he looked round
                  the room, and finally his gaze rested full on the face of Mr. Bellew, his host,
                  and future father-in-law. No sign of weariness in Leonard now. There was even more
                  than usual energy and vigor in his face; he rose erect in his seat, still holding
                  the little hand in his, still gazing at the old merchant's placid, well-favored
                  countenance.
               "It is a bitter night outside," Leonard said. "It will be a hard winter."
               "Hard winter, truly," observed Mr. Bellew. "My horses fell three times this
                  morning. At last I had to get out and walk a street's length to the
                  counting-house. Have you had any adventures, Leonard?"
               "Not of that kind," replied he, the faintest smile quivering at his mouth.
               "No. But we look for something more stirring from you, you have been away ten
                  days; in that romantic manufacturing district too. How did you leave
                  Blishford?"
               "Cleaner than it had ever been in its life, I think, for the snow fell even faster
                  than the dirt."
               "All business satisfactorily settled?" Mr. Bellew asked, en passant.
               
               "The business is settled."
               "Come, come; you needn't blush, Rosamond!" said Mr. Bellew, who seemed genial even
                  to jocularity on this occasion. "So much of the preliminaries over, then.
                  Well—well—well. Miss Agnes, shall I give you this hand-screen."
               The old gentleman bent forward, always studiously polite to his fair guest. It was
                  curious to watch his grave face relax into a smile of stately, Grandisonian
                  courtesy, while all the time the shrewd eyes shone, the inflexible mouth was firm
                  and hard.
               "Papa, papa!" cried one little fairy, who tumbled round on the hearth-rug—a tiny bundle of azure silk and
                  lace—with a rosy face beaming up in eager inquiry, "is it true, papa, is Rosamond
                  to be married soon?"
               "And will she go away?" chimed in the other, "and won't she be our very own any
                  more?"
               Rosamond rose. She might be excused for seeking her work from a table in the inner
                  room, pending the answer to these inquiries. But Leonard followed her—Leonard drew
                  her yet further away—into the little conservatory, at one side of which Rosamond
                  was accustomed to sit and read or write or work. Her little desk was there now;
                  her chair stood beside it, and a white vase with a single crimson rose in it. She
                  took this last in her hand, and examined it with great attention.
               "It is for you," she said, softly. "I have watched it budding day after day, and
                  this very morning it opened. It knew you were coming, you see. I had taught it to
                  know."
               "Shall we sit here awhile?" said Leonard. "I like this place. It is pleasant to be
                  here."
               "And remember," said she, "you have everything to tell me."
               He started. She smiled up at him, in the very overflowing of contentment.
               "Oh, I have so much to hear!" she went on, gaily; "the history of ten days, the
                  full, true, and particular history. You know it is of no use to attempt to satisfy
                  me with less. So begin, do begin."
               She sat down and he took his place beside her. Such a serene, sweet face was
                  drooped from his gaze, such quivering happiness played about the rosy mouth. There
                  was a brief silence: they could hear the children's voices in the other room, and
                  Agnes's vivacious tones clear above the rest.
               "She is telling them a story," said Rosamond, "and I am going to hear my own
                  special story—am I not?"
               Leonard's voice, steadfast and sustained, vibrated on the murmur of distant sound
                  with special distinctness.
               "Yes, darling, you should be told."
               Something in the tone of his voice, an indefinite, indescribable something, smote
                  Rosamond's quick sense. The shy happiness faded from her face; she looked up with
                  a swift, appealing glance—a sort of helpless deprecation of ill.
               "Leonard! What is it?"
               "I will tell you all, my Rosamond. My Rosamond," he repeated fondly, with a quiet
                  smile, that insensibly smoothed away, for the moment, the trouble in her face. He
                  held her hand close, and began.
               "You are to see me, then, going through that wonderful town, at once so rich and
                  so squalid—so magnificent and so miserable, with its thousands upon thousands of
                  inhabitants, mostly poor—many of them destitute—some even despairing. Through the
                  dark, dismal streets, where all the falling snow was polluted by smoke and filth,
                  and even through the frost the air was heavy and impure. Past miserable
                  dwellings—hovels, where people seemed festering, not living; where I saw gaunt
                  figures moving about with wretched faces, ashen-hued—with glaring eyes, and
                  sunken, hollow cheeks. I saw their hungry, fierce looks as they passed me by—these
                  creatures that want, and disease, and ignorance together seemed to have left
                  scarcely human. Rosamond, my heart swelled as I saw them, and knew that the
                  avarice and cold-heartedness of my uncle had helped to make them so. I thought
                  that, in the days to come, life should hold better things for them, that I would
                  repair the injuries—right the injustice that he had done."
               
               "Ah—your uncle's property was in those miserable streets."
               "Chiefly. I planned great benefactions, I imagined gigantic schemes of
                  improvement. In my mind I looked on the same places, and the people in them, ten
                  years hence. I thought how we would work together to help them—minds and
                  bodies."
               "And we will—we will!" cried Rosamond, with unconscious apprehension giving
                  poignance to her tone.
               "Ay, love, if it please God." He stopped a little after those lowly-uttered words.
                  Then he resumed.
               "From thoughts, dreams, plans like these, I went back to Woolthorpe, the old house
                  where my uncle lived his latter years, and died. I went back, thinking of those
                  poor souls' misery, which I was to alleviate through my great happiness. That was
                  last night, darling. Last night, at this time, I was thinking to myself of this
                  night's joy of return." He went on more rapidly. "And I set to work, tying up
                  papers, arranging the deeds and parchments with which the old bureau was full, and
                  which the lawyers and I had been busy over for many days. I had just finished; I
                  was closing one of the small inner drawers, which slightly resisted the effort. I
                  pressed it harder, and touched some secret spring, it seems, and a side drawer
                  sprang 'open."
               "How strange!" said Rosamond.
               "A paper lay there, carefully folded, not very long since written. I saw my
                  uncle's bold signature at the bottom of the page. I think I knew what it was
                  before I opened it and read." He paused an instant and drew breath. "It was my
                  uncle's will, which they had vainly sought, and could not find."
               "Yes—but—I do not understand." She faltered, for she saw in his face ample
                  interpretation of all the rest.
               "It was a will in his own handwriting, dated a very few weeks before his death. A
                  will, by which he leaves all his property in the charge of trustees for the
                  benefit of charities in Blishford, and elsewhere; but especially to found
                  institutions, hospitals, and asylums in that wretched town. You see, Rosamond, my
                  schemes were anticipated. Remorse came to the poor old man, and a yearning to do
                  something by his death that might alleviate the wretchedness he had helped to
                  increase during his life! God knows the secrets of his heart; it was not all
                  hard."
               "But you?"
               "I and Agnes are mentioned in the will—five hundred pounds are left to each of us.
                  Also inclosed with it was a letter to his former partner in Calcutta, recommending
                  me to him. It was always his wish that I should go there."
               "Leonard! don't speak in that manner! Leonard! Leonard!" She turned upon him her
                  pale, agonized face. She caught his arm feebly, looking round with an imploring,
                  searching look. "Wait a little; I cannot, cannot understand yet."
               "Rosamond!"
               "No, no," she cried hastily, "don't try to tell me."
               He put his arm round her, but, in the action, his calmness fled from him. He
                  leaned his head down on his hands; he hid his face. One sudden, passionate groan
                  escaped him. Then was silence, through which they could hear Mr. Bellew's voice,
                  grave, deliberate, and decided, and the children's musical treble blending with
                  it. Twice Rosamond tried to speak, but the words died away, unuttered. A strange,
                  almost fierce look, unnatural to see on her girlish face, quivered about every
                  feature. At last she whispered:
               "Will this separate us? Do you mean that?"
               "Do I mean it?"
               "Because," she went on hurriedly, but still in a whisper, "if it is done, it will be done by you. There is no
                  one else to do it; no one—no one else who could"—She stopped.
               Leonard looked up. With her two little hands she clasped his brow so that he could
                  not look at her. And the mutinous, half-frenzied look still grew, and grew.
               "It is not right, it cannot be right," she said mechanically. "God could never
                  intend"—
               "Hush! Let us look steadily at our fate; let us meet it, since it must be met,
                  submissively."
               "What is our fate to be, then?" she asked, abruptly; "it is for you to
                  decide."
               He did not understand her meaning, though he thought he did.
               "No, Rosamond, it is for neither you nor me to decide. It is already fixed."
               "Does any one know of—of this will besides you?" she said, quickly.
               "No one. The person who must first be informed lives in London. I shall go to him
                  to-morrow."
               "No!" she said, imperatively, and paused. "No," she said again, imploringly,
                  frightened at Leonard's silence.
               "Rosamond!"
               "We—we could do all he wished," she whispered, while a burning spot rose on each
                  cheek, "even as you planned before, before you found—. It would be no wrong done
                  to any human being. Leonard, Leonard!"
               He drew her closely to him, and kissed her forehead, with a sad, tender pain
                  expressed in his look.
               "Leonard! Oh, speak to me!"
               "Wait. Think a little."
               "Think!" She broke from his arms, and looked up in his face in cold reproach. "Can
                     you think of what is the issue of all this? Do you love me less
                  entirely, then, than I love you? Anything, everything, is to me better, nobler,
                  truer than that we should part. We! It is not one little month since
                  we first learned to say that word. I had known it and uttered it in my heart long,
                  long before. I knew you must love me by the strength of my own love. I knew we
                  were one. Heaven made us so.—Yet you would part us! You could bear to do it!"
               "I could bear to do it," Leonard repeated slowly, looking at her,
                     "because we are one."
               She stretched out her arms in a sort of helpless, passionate appeal. Her hand
                  touched the crimson rose, smiling in gorgeous fulness and completeness from its
                  crystal vase. She looked at it for a minute, then—her face changed. The dilated
                  eyes softened, the fiery spot faded from her cheek. The frantic passion was dying
                  out. The first instinct of rebellion was yielding to the truer, purer,
                  woman-nature. She bent her head down into her hands.
               "We were so happy, so happy. God pity us!" she said, and the tears came
                  plenteously and tenderly. And Leonard, in his soul, cried, "God help us,
                  strengthen us!" For he needed both help and strength. In a little while she knelt
                  closely beside him, her head leaning on his breast, weeping out the passion that
                  had burned so fiercely as to convulse the delicate frame wherein it flamed.
                  Presently when Leonard spoke, his low voice seemed gradually to still the sobs.
                  She looked up—with the old sweet look, that for him her face had always worn. It
                  almost struck down his courage to see it. With a flash came the thought of the
                  coming life, life without her. What that meant to him, only his own
                  heart could tell. For a brief space he wrestled with that heart. It was mutinous,
                  it resisted the crushing fate that loomed heavy and dark before it. All the strong
                  passion of his man's nature roused itself, and rebelled against the suffering. It
                  fought fiercely, it struggled with
                  desperate strength. It cried out against the weary years; the desolate cruel time
                  that was coming. How often do we recoil thus from the time that is
                     coming! Why do we not remember that we live in eternity, and so be
                  patient?
               Some such thought came to Leonard, and helped to still the tumult. And Rosamond
                  did not guess what had passed during those moments that he remained so
                  still,—shading his face with his hand. She did not know all the meaning of the
                  uplifted look with which he turned to her again. And he only said:
               "Rosamond, my Rosamond! We will have courage." Then they heard the children
                  calling them.
               "I will not go back, in there," Rosamond said faintly. She laid her hand on the
                  side door that led into the corridor. But suddenly, she remembered—what it would
                  be when next she saw him, and she shrank back with a low cry.
               He bent over her. He folded her in his arms. As a mother that yearns to her child,
                  with a tenderness as pure, a sorrow as sacred, Leonard held his betrothed closely
                  strained to his heart. Again he said, and with a kind of stern resolve, as to
                  himself:
               "We will have courage!"
               Then he let her go.
               Two months more, and Leonard Ross was on his way to India. He only waited for his
                  sister's marriage. Then he went. There is little need to relate the history of
                  those two months. For Rosamond they held much strife, struggle, and passionate but
                  impotent resistance. It was Leonard who had to teach her what he, alas! needed all
                  his strength of manhood to recognise with submission; that in patience and power
                  of endurance lay their hope, and not in rebellious strivings against the
                  inevitable. That it was inevitable they both felt, Leonard from the first, and
                  Rosamond later; there was no possibility of tampering with the circumstances
                  before them, unless by a dereliction from that straight path of truth and honor
                  which had ever been the roadway of Leonard's life.
               So they parted. Parted, knowing in how full, and deep, and wide a sense of
                  parting. Agnes, married to her sailor-lover, would be wandering about the world
                  for years to come,—that link of possible communication was broken. And Mr. Bellew,
                  in the midst of his bland courtesy, contrived to take his measures decisively and
                  surely. Very soon after the disclosure of what he called "the truly extraordinary
                  circumstances of the case," he removed his household to an estate of his in
                  Cornwall. He laid down no stringent rules, he impressed no stern commands; but
                  with the quiet, cruel, cold shrewdness which ever went hand in hand with his
                  indomitable will, he insured the absolute and entire cessation of all intercourse
                  between his daughter and her lover. Rosamond, high-spirited and resolute as she
                  was, could not combat with the experience and gentlemanly scheming that her father
                  employed when he chose. Leonard was almost equally at fault; for, though he knew
                  the character he had to cope with, it was only with the theoretical knowledge that
                  the penetration of a good man has into the nature of a worldly and designing
                  one.
               Mr. Bellew gained credit for much magnanimity in permitting Leonard to write once,
                  once only, before he left England. The letter was written, but it never reached
                  her. She saw that the ship had sailed in which she knew he was to go. She even
                  heard of his embarkation from poor Agnes, bridal Agnes; torn between conflicting
                  joy and grief, the union with her lover, and the parting with her brother.
               After that a blank. The grave itself, it seemed, could not have divided them more
                  surely.
               In the solitude of the wild sea-shore, with her little sisters for her companions, Rosamond learned
                  acquaintance with the face of her sorrow. There the quiet capacity to endure, grew
                  and waxed stronger upon the ashes of the fiery emotions which had at first spent
                  her strength. Leonard had said, in almost the last words his voice had borne to
                  her:
               "Have no fear. We can bear it."
               Nevertheless, there were seasons of exquisite pain—of ineffable weariness and
                  desolation, when the face of Consolation was hid from her, and the presence of
                  Peace was no longer with her. Seasons of doubt, of self-upbraidings, when she
                  could fain have called herself traitress to the great truth of her life; and in
                  bitterness and scorn looked on the submission which she had learned so hardly. But
                  one doubt never came to her—the cruellest, the worst pang was spared. Next to her
                  trust in Heaven was her faith in Leonard. After all, she who loves thus is
                  happy.
               Meanwhile, there came many suitors to Miss Bellew, and even when her youthful
                  radiance had faded, as it did fade sooner than it should have done, many came. And
                  her father chafed wrathfully at the whimsical obstinacy of woman-nature, but
                  nodded his head wisely the while, saying, "In time—in time!"
               At length, one strange, wonderful day, there came to Rosamond a letter. Leonard
                  wrote, openly and with no attempt at disguise—it was singular that, so sent, the
                  letter ever reached her. But it came—she had it, this absolute, tangible, visible
                  thought from him to her. Only a few words—but there could be no more to Rosamond
                  than they held for her. He said—"Tell Mr. Bellew I have written. I do not seek to
                  deceive him, as you know, my Rosamond. But I must write, I will write. Something
                  must go from me that your eyes will look on, that your heart will receive. Soul to
                  soul we are together, but while we live otherwise than in the soul, we crave for
                  more, and the humanity is strong within me, and cries loudly." Little more than
                  this—but it was enough. It lit her life for many, many months. Moreover, she wrote
                  back openly, as he had done, and never knew that Mr. Bellew, grown more cautious
                  and acute for his former negligence, did not suffer the letter to go. More than
                  once in the years that followed, letters were intercepted by the watchful,
                  inexorable old man. Rosamond never knew—never suspected.
               So the years went on. The two little girls grew up, and, one after the other, the
                  elder sister saw them leave her. Her brother was at the head of the great
                  mercantile house of Bellew, and at last the old merchant retired with his eldest
                  daughter to an estate he had lately purchased, and which he had settled on
                  Rosamond. There the old man lingered out his remaining days, and there he died,
                  nine years after Leonard Ross left England for India.
               Then Rosamond was alone. She lived a very quiet, solitary life, only different
                  from what it had been before her father's death, inasmuch as her close and devoted
                  attention to him being remitted, she had more time to give to the charities and
                  other beautiful and womanly duties with which her life was lustrous. The Lady of
                  the Manor was like a good angel to the poor, the ignorant, and the suffering
                  around her. The appearance of the tall, slender figure, with its gentle, gliding
                  dignity of movement, and the drooped face, so sweet, and pale, and thoughtful, was
                  a signal of help and consolation to many an aching heart in the village and about
                  the country where she lived.
               Thus it was one day early in January, such a day as comes sometimes in mid-winter
                  like a thought of childhood to an old man; telling wondrous tidings of the
                  far-away spring that is,—though we see it—and that will surely come to us again.
                  It was evening, and the sun was near to his setting; great purple clouds hung
                  about him, and fragments of them, as of
                  a rent robe, were scattered over the clear sky. The wide landscape seemed to
                  tremble in the amber light that was shed across it from the west; the leafless
                  branches of the trees were traced, intensely black, against the golden horizon,
                  while groves of dark and heavy-foliaged firs opposed their rounded masses of
                  shadow to the lustrous heaven, and would not draw in any of the radiance with
                  which the world was overflowing.
               Nestling among the abrupt hills and wild breaks of moorland, lay the park and
                  manor-house where Rosamond Bellew lived. The greensward sloped to a broad stream
                  that flowed through the domain; beyond it rose woods, purpling in the distance.
                  Crowning the hill, nearer, was a grove of pines, tall, column-like, and with a
                  "whushing" music, as of distant waves, ever murmuring about their crests. Great
                  trees stood grandly about the park—benign oaks, lofty beeches, and cedars, with a
                  mystery in their low-spreading branches, and their eternal depth of shade. Joyous
                  with aërial beauty the birches looked, grouped on a slope near the grey old
                  mansion, like girls who longed but were ashamed to run. They were divided by an
                  invisible fence from the dainty garden beneath the windows of the lady's special
                  sitting-room. Behind these birches the radiance of the sunset grew and faded every
                  evening now, and Rosamond always stood at her window to watch it.
               She stood there now—a tall, grey-clad woman; no longer young, either in face, in
                  figure, or in movement; but fair still, and gracious to behold, with a look which
                  had in it some kinship to the clear, cold, and pure serenity of the winter
                  evening. So she stood, her hands clasped lightly together, shining white upon the
                  dusky, cloud-like folds of her robe, watching the sunset and
                  thinking—thinking—thinking.
               Not fifty miles from that quiet English valley flows the sea, and its waves break
                  stormily outside the harbor into which the ships come, many in a day, from every
                  part of the world, bringing hundreds home. Who shall say that it is a miserable
                  world, when one day can hold so much of happiness as those simple words
                     express—coming home?
               
               There is one ship just coming in, and the passengers crowd on the after-deck; some
                  already straining their eyes to catch the first sight of a beloved familiar face
                  on the shore; some lounging, careless, too used to wanderings to feel much of the
                  sacred joy of return; some curiously gazing about them, new to the scene, and
                  their perceptions keenly aroused to everything around. But one or two stand apart,
                  with eyes that look outward but see inwardly, and thoughts that are trembling,
                  deep, deep down underneath the outside unrippled calm of aspect—thoughts that none
                  may guess at, and only One knows are there.
               The erect figure of a man stands out a little aloof from the rest. He is watching
                  the sun sink below an English horizon—watching the soft clouds hovering over an
                  English landscape. His dark hair—you may see silver streaks in it, though he is
                  not old—is tossed by the wind about his brow over his face. He loved to feel it—to
                  recognise the old familiar breath on his cheek, for it is part of the home he has
                  lost so long, but now has found again. Ten years he has been a stranger in a
                  strange land, but now—he is coming home.
               You who have never left it, never know rapture like the heart-leap to these words.
                  Your eyes do not see the glorified beauty which his drink in with
                  every common sight, so long unseen till now. The cries of the sailors among the
                  rigging of the many ships around—the familiar shouts on shore—the clanging of
                  bells, the simplest, most accustomed sounds, come on his ears with a very anguish
                  of remembrance. He had never forgotten them. But between the two verges of remembrance and oblivion dwells the
                  actuality which is beyond and above both, in which there is no degree—it
                     is—complete and full and satisfying.
               Our traveller stood so silent, that a fellow-passenger addressed him twice before
                  he heard. But then he turned round neither vexedly nor impatiently.
               "Yes; it is a lovely evening for our landing," he said, smiling.
               "May I ask," for these two had been companions during the long voyage, and one, at
                  least, was much interested in the other, "do you go direct to your own home
                  to-night?"
               "No. I have no abode in England. It is a wide home that I am coming to. But—it is
                  home."
               "Let us then stay at the same inn to-night."
               "Many thanks; but I am going on further at once. I start immediately on
                  landing."
               He smiled again—a courteous, genial smile to his companion; a very strange,
                  wistful, half-eager, half-restrained smile to himself. Involuntarily his eyes
                  seemed to seek the sunset again. Glowing, golden, ambient, shone the sky, and the
                  water in which it was reflected. Far away, on shore, he could see woods and fields
                  and rising hills. Perhaps, even dimly, he could catch the cloudy outline of one of
                  those hills behind which Rosamond Bellew was even then watching the last rays
                  fading behind the birch-trees, and thinking—thinking.
               And perhaps it may be that thought can leap to thought more quickly, more surely,
                  than glance responds to glance, or word to word. Who can tell?
               But thus it was that Leonard Ross came home.
            
            
               A Royal Whim.
               WE are about to tell our readers a very strange event that occurred in the reign
                  of William I., of Prussia, father of the great Frederick, and a man generally
                  disliked, on account of his rough and frequently tyrannical manner, but who was
                  really one of the best regents of his fatherland, as he alone (and to this his son
                  afterwards bore testimony) was the real founder of its future greatness.
               This extraordinary man, who should be judged by the customs of the age in which he
                  lived, in order to prove him extraordinary both in his errors and his virtues, had
                  one passion which far outweighed all others—namely, love for the chase. We
                  remember reading in his historian, Förster, that within one year he killed upwards
                  of three thousand partridges with his own gun, without taking the other game into
                  account, in which the queen was the greatest sufferer, as she had to find him,
                  according to a marriage contract, in powder and shot gratis. When there was
                  nothing for him to shoot in his own forests, he never declined the invitations of
                  the landed gentry to pay them a visit.
               Thus it happened that—it might be about the year 1720—the rich landed proprietor, Von W——, sent his
                  majesty an invitation to a wolf hunt, with the humble request that he would bring
                  his most illustrious consort with him, as the nobleman's wife had formerly
                  belonged to her majesty's suite.
               On a fine September day, then, the king and queen, with several officers and
                  ladies of the bedchamber, as well as the court fool, Baron von Gündling, arrived
                  at the nobleman's ancestral château. On the very next day the chase commenced, and
                  Von Gündling, who found as little pleasure in the sports of the field as the king
                  did in the arts and sciences, took a solitary walk in the meadows, and lay down to
                  read in the long grass.
               But before we hear what happened further, we must first give our readers a
                  description of this strange man. He was, as we have already remarked, the king's
                  fool, and had received all imaginable titles and honors, in order to afford his
                  majesty and the court still greater sport. In fact, his Excellency, the Supreme
                  Master of the Ceremonies, Privy Councillor, and President of the Academy of Arts,
                  Baron von Gündling, acquired such arrogance through his titles, that nothing could
                  be more comical than the contrast between these dignities and the indignities he
                  had to suffer daily, even from the youngest lieutenants. His excellency on such
                  occasions would grow very angry—the very thing his tormentors wished—and would lay
                  a protest before the king against a man of his rank being so treated, which
                  naturally increased the general laughter. Through such scenes, which were in that
                  day considered remarkably comical, our fool had become a necessity for the king
                  and court. Besides, we may add that he was a walking lexicon, and had to give all
                  possible explanations in the daily meetings of the so-termed "tabaks collegien."
                  His pedantry, in fact, was the best thing about him; as for wit, he possessed as
                  little as a mule, but, to make up for it, he could be as vicious and obstinate as
                  that amiable animal.
               The Baron von Gündling, then, lay at full length in the grass, in his peculiar
                  dress, the chief ornament of it being an immense, full-bottomed wig, and in such a
                  position that only the locks of his peruke could be seen as he moved from side to
                  side. A gentleman, who arrived rather late for the chase, happened to notice it,
                  and taking it for some strange animal, fired point-blank at the wig, but very
                  fortunately missed it. His excellency sprang up immediately, in the highest
                  indignation, and cried out,
               "You vagabond rascal, how dare you——?"
               The gentleman, however, when he perceived that the strange animal must necessarily
                  belong to the royal suite, did not wait to reply, but ran off at full speed to the
                  neighboring forest. The baron, however, was not satisfied with this, but, as he
                  saw a man ploughing at a short distance from him, he called out, in his arrogant
                  manner—
               "Come hither, man!"
               The reply he received was,
               "I have no time or inclination to do so; but if you'll speak civilly I may."
               His excellency was not accustomed to such an answer; he therefore walked towards
                  the impudent ploughman, with upraised stick, and was about to apply it to his
                  back, when he noticed that it was the clergyman of the village, whom he had seen
                  the preceding evening at the nobleman's château. The baron, therefore, lowered his
                  stick, and contented himself by punishing the clergyman with his tongue.
               "How can he be such an impertinent ass! Does he not know who I am?"
               "Oh, yes! he's the king's fool."
               His excellency trembled with rage, and raised his stick again; but on measuring the sturdy pastor from head
                  to foot, and seeing no help near, he let it fall for the second time, and merely
                  uttered the threat—
               "Just wait, my fine fellow. I'll tell the king you pretend to be a pastor, and yet
                  go out ploughing."
               The clergyman replied, quite calmly,
               "My gracious master will probably remember that Cincinnatus ploughed too, and he
                  was a dictator, while I am only a poor village pastor."
               "Yes," the baron said, after inspecting his coarse and peasant-like dress; "but
                  when Cincinnatus ploughed he did not look like a common peasant."
               "I am certain he did not look like a fool," the clergyman replied, as he drove his
                  oxen on.
               This was too much for the baron, and he rushed away towards a peasant he saw
                  approaching, vowing vengeance on the impudent pastor, whom he determined to ruin
                  on the first opportunity.
               He was very glad, then, to find in the peasant a most determined enemy to the
                  clergyman, who complained bitterly of his sternness, and of the fact of his
                  compelling him to make up a quarrel he had carried on very successfully with his
                  wife for several weeks.
               Our fool was clever enough to see that this anecdote would not be of any service
                  to him in trying to injure the pastor with the king; he therefore answered, most
                  pathetically,
               "But the pastor was perfectly in the right; that could do you no harm."
               "Well, that's very true," the peasant replied, "especially as he's getting old,
                  and can't carry on as he used; but I'm sure when his son soon takes his place—a
                  fellow like a church steeple—he'll break all our bones for us. For that reason, if
                  the matter was left to me, I wouldn't choose him for our clergyman; for if the
                  patron is to beat us on workdays, and the pastor play the same game on Sundays,
                  when will our backs find time to get well?"
               Gündling now listened attentively, and his plan was soon formed, when he learned
                  that the pastor's son would return from Halle in a few days, to preach his trial
                  sermon on the next Sunday, as the patron had promised him his father's living. He
                  therefore quitted the peasant with a mocking smile, and made some pretext for
                  visiting the sexton, to make further inquiries into the matter. The latter
                  confirmed the story, and gave his opinion, that the young master must be at least
                  six feet two inches in height, and as straight as a poplar tree.
               "Wait!" Gündling murmured between his teeth, as soon as he again reached the
                  street; "we will put a blue coat on the young fellow, and that will annoy that
                  vagabond preacher." He therefore returned to the château, where he looked up a
                  captain of his acquaintance, whom he took on one side, with the hurried
                  question,
               "How many fellows have you already got?"
               To understand this question, our reader must know, that the king, at every review,
                  requested each commander of a company to present his new recruits to him. If the
                  poor gentleman had less than three he fell into partial disgrace; and so each
                  captain, about review time, which was close at hand, tried to procure a few young
                  men, by any method, legal or illegal, but especially those particularly tall, for
                  the king had a peculiar delight in such soldiers.
               "Woe is me! I've but one," the officer replied, "and he's only a journeyman
                  tailor."
               "Well, then," Gündling replied, "you can get a journeyman clergyman of six feet
                  two."
               "Well, that's no tremendous height, but still it's better than nothing."
               
               The captain then requested an explanation, and both discussed the measures by
                  which to get hold of the clergyman's son. They soon agreed that the officer should
                  feign illness when the king departed. Gündling would remain with him as company; a
                  few soldiers would be secretly procured from a neighboring town, and the young
                  candidate taken nolens volens by the ears, and
                  transported to the next garrison.
               In the meanwhile, the king and his suite followed the chase on the next day, with
                  their usual ardor. It so happened, that two ladies in attendance on the queen,
                  tortured by ennui, followed the windings of the
                  stream, which led them from the nobleman's garden into the open fields. One of
                  them, Wilhelmine von B——, was a young and charming creature, and was evidently
                  attempting to cheer her companion, who was silent, and not nearly so charming. In
                  consequence there was a deal of laughing, which might have been heard at some
                  distance off, and might have led to the conclusion that the old, though still ever
                  new, story of marriage and love was being discussed by the ladies. They had
                  gradually wandered some quarter of a mile from the village, when a wolf, probably
                  disturbed by the beaters, and which they at first took for a dog, ran towards
                  them, regarding them with a look which they interpreted, "This little darling I'll
                  make my breakfast off, and the other little darling I'll leave on that bed of
                  forget-me-nots till supper time."
               The poor girls had not in the least expected such a bridegroom, and stood
                  petrified with fear as soon as they recognised the animal, for they possibly did
                  not know that a wolf, in the summer or autumn, would attack nobody, and that the
                  Isegrim who fascinated their eyes was, probably, as much afraid of them as they
                  were of him. The silent young lady sobbed out a masculine name—we presume sume
                  that of her lover—while the charming one, after recovering from her first terror,
                  looked round on all sides for assistance.
               Suddenly a carriage made its appearance from a branch road, drawn by two horses,
                  in which a young and handsome man was sitting. Both ladies cried out together in
                  joyful surprise, when they perceived this unexpected assistance, and the wolf
                  immediately ran off, and took up his station some distance from them. "You have
                  saved us from death," the charming Wilhelmine said, as she approached the young
                  man, who immediately ordered the coachman to stop, and leaped from the carriage.
                  After begging, in the style of French gallantry, to have his doubts cleared up as
                  to whether he looked upon nymphs or hamadryads, or actual mortals, and all
                  possible explanations had been furnished him, he presented himself to the ladies
                  as the son of the old pastor, and just arrived from Halle, in order to act as
                  curate to his father. The young man, whom we will call Carl, then invited the
                  ladies to take seats in his vehicle, and thus return to the château.
               The ladies quickly accepted this invitation, and Carl had the pleasure of lifting
                  them into the lofty carriage, in which he also took his seat, exactly opposite the
                  fair Wilhelmine, who, however, was cruel enough, for some time, to look every way
                  but at him. At length, when he began to speak of Halle, where he had been several
                  years "Famulus" at the house of Freylinghausen, she turned her eyes with pleasure
                  towards him, for she was well acquainted with this poet, and became so eloquent
                  that her companion blushed, nudged her repeatedly, and at length whispered in her
                  ear, "Ah, mon Dieu! he's not a nobleman." Wilhelmine, however, paid no attention
                  to her, and as the young man was very well read, and recited several of
                  Freylinghausen's newest poems, the time passed so quickly, that they stopped before the rectory almost without
                  perceiving it. Here all the family assembled round the carriage, and wished to
                  embrace their dear relative; but this he declined, and first presented his fair
                  companions, who were immediately invited into the rectory, which the silent one at
                  first declined, but the other immediately accepted.
               After the first stormy salutation the old clergyman clasped his hands, and
                  commenced the hymn, "Praise God for all his gifts!" in which the whole family
                  joined; among them our friend Carl, with such a splendid tenor voice, that the
                  young lady could not refrain from saying, after the hymn was ended—
               "If you would do me a real favor, you would sing me that song of Freylinghausen's
                  which you recited to us on our road here."
               This request was so flattering, that Carl could not refuse to comply with it. He
                  therefore sang, as solo, the song, "My heart should feel contented," without the
                  least idea that, in a very short time, not merely all his consolation, but all his
                  good fortune, would originate from this song.
               The charming Wilhelmine was highly delighted when he had finished the song; and
                  the two ladies took their leave, on the earnest persuasion of the silent one of
                  the two. Carl politely accompanied them to the neighboring gate of the château,
                  where they parted with mutual compliments.
               The young man felt, for the first day or two, as if he had lost something
                  necessary to his existence; but as the difference of rank between himself and a
                  lady of the royal suite appeared to him an insurmountable obstacle, he soon forgot
                  the strange adventure, in which he was materially assisted by the composition of
                  his trial sermon, which he was to preach the next Sunday before his patron and the
                  congregation. In the meanwhile, however, the king and his suite had returned to
                  Berlin, while Gündling and the captain remained behind to carry out their
                     treacherous scheme. The captain pretended to be suffering
                  from a frightful attack of gout, and had secretly ordered a corporal and six men
                  to come on the 'ensuing Sunday night from the neighboring garrison of G——n, as he
                  had learned that their kind host intended to pay a visit at a gentleman's house
                  some thirty miles off, as soon as the candidate's sermon was ended, and would not
                  return for a week. During that time they expected to have the young recruit so
                  securely hidden away, that any reclamation would be unavailing; and besides, the
                  king's adjutant, who attended to all military affairs, was the captain's cousin.
                  Gündling, after his usual fashion, rubbed his stomach with both hands, as he
                  thought of the pastor's terrible despair at the loss of his beloved son.
               As soon as the anxiously desired Sunday arrived both gentlemen went to the
                  over-crowded church; the captain, as he hypocritically told his host, to return
                  thanks for his sudden and fortunate recovery, but in truth to have a nearer look
                  at his young recruit, whose height he was delighted with, and paid Gündling
                  repeated compliments for his discrimination. The poor young man gained complete
                  approbation from his patron and the whole parish, and even Gündling, after the
                  service was over, approached the pastor, and treacherously praised his good
                  fortune in having such a son. We must say, that the captain, to his credit, was
                  not guilty of such hypocrisy in this case.
               At a late hour in the evening, which was both stormy and cold, the sound of arms
                  and a loud knocking was heard at the door of the parsonage. The door was at length
                  opened by the unfortunate Carl, with the words,
               
               "Who are you, and what do you want, at this unseasonable hour of the night?"
               "We want you!" the captain exclaimed, as he sprang forward, and seized the young
                  man by the arm. "You must come with us, and change your black coat for a blue
                  one."
               We may easily imagine the terror of the wretched man, who, only partly dressed,
                  was standing speechless before them, when his old father, who had heard this
                  conversation, rushed out of bed, and interposed between them. He, too, was unable
                  at first to speak through terror, when he perceived in the moonlight the soldiers,
                  and among them Gündling, who burst into a loud laugh on seeing the father's agony.
                  This insult restored the old man to consciousness, and crying, "You villanous
                  Judas!" he rushed with clenched fists at the baron. Carl, however, interposed; but
                  as the old man could not be calmed, and the confusion and cries had become
                  general, for the mother and sisters had joined them, the young man repeatedly
                  begged to be allowed to speak; and when he gained permission he addressed the
                  following question to his father:
               "Do you believe that our Heavenly Father is aware of my fate, or not?"
               At this all were silent; but when the question was repeated, the old man
                  replied:
               "Why do you ask such a question? How should he, who knows everything, not be aware
                  of your fate?"
               "Well, then," the son calmly replied, "if you believe that, you must not forget
                  that 'all things work together for good to those who love God.' I love him, and
                  willingly yield to my fate; and will only dress myself, and then be ready to
                  follow the captain."
               "No!" the latter replied, "you must come directly. Allons—march!"
               All ran after the unfortunate man, crying to him, and striving to retain him, but
                  in vain. Father, mother, and sisters were driven back by the butt-ends of the
                  muskets.
               "He will not be frozen," the captain cried, "before getting out of the village,
                  and then he'll put on his accoutrements."
               We will not attempt to give any description of the condition of the sorrowing
                  family, as a soldier's life in that day was not merely the most disgraceful, but
                  also the most wretched, on earth; and many a father, had the choice been left him,
                  would sooner have seen his son in his coffin than in the colored coat.
               The unhappy father waited in vain for a letter from his son from one week—from one
                  month to another. The captain had taken all necessary precautions to cut off every
                  opportunity for communication. No one knew what had become of him, and although it
                  was so very difficult, on this very account, to claim him, still both pastor and
                  patron attempted it, though, as may be easily imagined, in vain. After repeated
                  petitions to his royal majesty, they at length received a very harsh reply from
                  the minister of war himself: that they made a most insane request in asking them
                  to look for a recruit in the ranks of the whole Prussian army, when no one, not
                  even themselves, knew where he was; and he must be getting on well, or else he
                  would have written to them.
               Two years thus elapsed, without the disconsolate father, who had long before
                  received a young curate to assist him, hearing the least news about his son, and
                  therefore supposed that he had died through the cold on that frightful evening, or
                  at the halberts.
               At length, when the second year had just ended, he received a message from the
                  neighboring town, to say that his son was in good health, and intended to visit
                  him that same evening, in company with
                  the lady of the Dean of P——. When their joy at this unexpected news, which
                  appeared to the old man almost fabulous, was moderated, and a thousand questions
                  asked of the messenger, no one could certainly furnish any explanation as to his
                  strange companion; but this was their least anxiety. "The dean's lady," the old
                  mother gave it as her opinion, "will soon be tired of us." And long before evening
                  the whole family set out to welcome their Joseph, as the old man called him. They
                  had just arrived at the cross-road we have already visited, when a carriage drove
                  up, out of the window of which a charming little white hand was stretched, and a
                  silvery voice uttered the words, "Yes, yes, dear Carl, here it was that you saved
                  me from the wolf." At the moment he looked out he recognised his parents. A cry of
                  joy burst from him, which was echoed by the whole family. The coachman was bidden
                  to stop, the lady and gentleman sprang out, and it was some time before the old
                  father could say, "Now then tell us all, you wicked boy; you caused us much grief
                  by not writing a single word."
               "I could not, I dared not," Carl replied. "The captain made me pledge my honor
                  that I would not send you any news of my place of abode. If I kept my word he
                  promised to give me my liberty at the end of three years."
               "And the worthy captain set you free at the expiration of two," his father
                  remarked.
               "Not he," Carl replied. "Death alone could have saved me from his clutches. I owe
                  my liberty to our glorious king."
               "Tell us—tell us how," all cried; "let the carriage drive home."
               "Yes," the patron cried, who had come to share in the general joy, "send the
                  carriage away. I must know all about it. We will take our seats on this bank."
               All—among them the dean's lady, to whom no one had yet paid any attention—seated
                  themselves on the grassy couch, and kept their eyes fixed on the young man, who
                  wiped away his tears, and then commenced thus:
               "How badly I fared, and how grieved I was, at not being able to send any news to
                  my dear parents and sisters I need not tell you. My only trust was in God; for had
                  I not had him to support me, I should have acted like a hundred others—either
                  deserted, or put an end to my life. But my faith, which daily found nourishment in
                  the beautiful text with which I quitted you on that night of terror, 'We know that
                  all things work together for good to them that love God,' supported me in all my
                  necessities.
               "Thus it happened that, just fourteen days ago, I stood as sentinel in the grand
                  corridor of the royal palace at Berlin. I was thinking, as usual, of home, and as
                  I felt very low-spirited, and besides, fancied the neighboring apartments
                  unoccupied, I commenced singing that sweet song of Freylinghausen, 'My heart
                  should feel contented;' when I was singing the third verse a door opened, to my
                  great embarrassment, and I saw this lady's head."
               "Ah! the dean's lady," the old pastor said, as he bowed to her. "Now I am
                  beginning to see more clearly into matters." And he straightway poured forth a
                  multitude of apologies, for not having noticed her before, through his immoderate
                  joy at his son's return.
               "But, father," the son inquired, "do you not recognise the lady?"
               The old man, however, and his wife, had long forgotten the features. One of Carl's
                  sisters at length said:
               "That must be the young lady, if I am not mistaken, whom you saved from the
                  wolf?"
               "Certainly," Carl replied; "and at this very spot where we are now sitting so
                  happily together."
               
               But as all began crying, "Proceed, proceed with your story," he continued it in
                  the following fashion:
               "As soon as I saw the head I was in great fear, and ceased singing. The lady,
                  however, came very kindly towards me, measured me from head to foot, and at length
                  said:
               "'I could scarce believe my ears when I heard that voice, but my eyes cannot
                  deceive me. Surely you are the son of the clergyman of H——, who saved me from the
                  wolf two years ago?'
               "'I am that unhappy man,' I said to her; and then proceeded to tell her what a
                  frightful revenge Gündling had taken. Her eyes filled with tears, and she seemed
                  to me like an angel sent from on high to comfort me.
               "'You saved me from a wolf,' she exclaimed; 'and I will now do as much for you:'
                  and then hurried back into the room. I stood there with a beating heart, till a
                  page approached me with the words:
               "'Sentinel, as soon as you are released from duty you must go through that door,
                  and present yourself to her majesty the queen.'
               "I need not say with what anxiety I waited for the hour.
               "At length I was relieved, and trembling, I entered the queen's apartments. She
                  asked my history very graciously, and when I had finished it, she added:
               "'I can do nothing for you, my son, but I will beg the general to see that you are
                  on duty here to-morrow morning between eleven and twelve, the hour at which the
                  king pays me a visit. Then sing, with your clear voice that pleased me so much,
                  any verse you like of his majesty's favorite hymn, "Who puts his trust in God
                  alone." I will then see what more I can do for you.'
               "With these words her majesty dismissed me, and without the door I met this lady,
                  who whispered to me, 'Courage, courage; I trust all will be well.'
               "As I expected, I was placed on duty before the queen's apartments the next
                  morning, at eleven o'clock. As soon as I heard voices within I commenced singing a
                  verse of the hymn that had been commanded. However, I expected in vain to be
                  summoned again. The hour passed, and I fancied that no attention had been paid to
                  me; and I despaired, for I did not dare sing another verse."
               "And yet," the young lady here interrupted the narrator, "all proper attention had
                  been paid to your hymn, and I may be permitted to give an account of it, as Carl
                  has already become my dear husband."
               Another cry of astonishment was here raised. "What! what! your husband?" all
                  exclaimed. "I fancied you were a dean's wife," the old pastor remarked. "I never
                  heard of such a thing," the patron murmured, for he knew the lady was of very old
                  family, and both he and the pastor seemed scarce to know whether they were awake
                  or dreaming.
               "You must then hear my story," the young lady remarked, with a smile:
               "The voice delighted both of their majesties greatly, and as soon as I perceived
                  this I began saying everything I could in favor of the young man without, till the
                  king laughed, and said:
               "'Why, she must be in love with the fellow.'
               "I felt that I blushed at this remark, but still answered boldly:
               "'Yes, your majesty, for he saved me, two years ago, from a frightful wolf.'
               "'Diable!' the king added. 'You are of a very old family, and might get a
                  lieutenant, as far as I know.'
               "Here the queen interposed, and begged his majesty, who was in very good humor that day, not to torment
                  me further. I had opened my whole heart to her, and was determined on having this
                  grenadier, or no one else, for my husband. 'I must beg your majesty to remember,'
                  the queen continued, 'how carefully this good girl attended to our child in its
                  last illness.'
               "'Well,' the king remarked, 'we'll see. The captain praises the fellow; but still
                  she cannot, by any possibility, marry a simple curate. Well, as I said, we'll see.
                  I'll examine the fellow myself; but apropos,
                  suppose he will not have you?'
               "I did not know what answer to make to this inquiry, save by letting my eyes sink
                  on the ground; but the queen came to my assistance, by saying, 'Your majesty will
                  be best fitted to arrange that matter.'
               "'Well, that's very true,' the king replied. 'We'll see, then; the fellow will not
                  be such a fool as to refuse.' And with these words his majesty left the room,
                  apparently in deep thought.
               "That is the end of my story," the young lady said, "and my husband must proceed
                  with his now."
               Carl therefore continued:
               "I naturally believed that I had been quite unnoticed, especially as nothing of
                  the slightest importance occurred during the remainder of the day that might
                  nourish my hopes.
               "The next morning, however, at parade, the king cried out, after he had finished
                  all other affairs:
               "'Where is the fellow who stood as sentry yesterday morning, between eleven and
                  twelve, at the queen's door?—let him step out of the ranks.'
               "With a beating heart I obeyed this order, on which his majesty, without moving a
                  feature, first measured me from head to foot, and then said, 'Two under officers
                  here, take the fellow's coat off!' I could fancy nothing else than that I was
                  going to be tied up to the halberts for my unseasonable singing, and therefore
                  began tremulously, 'I implore your majesty, with all submission——' but the king
                  interrupted me: 'Don't argue—take his waistcoat off!' The under officers did what
                  they were commanded, and the king, in the same tone, and without moving a feature,
                  said, 'Now his gaiters!'
               "I now fancied I was going to be impaled at the least, and entreated, in my fear,
                  'I beg your majesty, on my knees, to be merciful to a poor fellow;' but the same
                  answer was given me—'Don't argue.'
               "As I stood there, in my shirt sleeves, the king ordered, 'Now bring that black
                  chest hither to the front.'
               "I was now certain of death, when I saw this chest brought up, in which I fancied
                  an executioner's sword, at the very least, was contained. I clasped my hands, and
                  commended my soul to God, when the king, before whom the chest had been deposited,
                  cried out to me, 'Now look in, and see how that suits you.'
               "As soon as I raised the lid, I saw, not a sword, or any instrument of torture,
                  but a black clerical dress, and the bands laid on the top of it. This change in my
                  feelings almost took my senses away, but the king's voice again aroused me. 'Now,
                  dress yourself immediately, and listen to what I say. Bring four drums here, and
                  lay a dozen side-arms across them, so that he cannot tumble through. The grenadier
                  shall preach us a sermon, for I must first examine him, and see if he has learned
                  anything. If he sits firm in the saddle, as the saying is, he can keep the black
                  stuff, and all it contains; but if he's a stupid ass, I'll make him put the coatee
                  on again. Now, then, up on the drums; you need not give it us long, but it must be
                  good.'
               "Assuredly," the young man continued, "I should have talked nothing but nonsense, through the agitated
                  nature of my feelings, and the fact that such a terrible alternative was offered
                  me, but, to my great good fortune, during the whole duration of my wretched
                  servitude, I had daily thought of my favorite text, and determined I would preach
                  on it the very first Sunday after my release. In fact, from continually thinking
                  on the subject, I had the whole discourse long before ready in my mind. I
                  therefore boldly mounted the drums, and began immediately with the words:—'St.
                  Paul says, in Rom. viii. 28, "And we know that all things work together for good
                  to them that love God;"' after which I gave a detailed account of my own
                  misfortunes, which worked together for good by the confirmation of my faith, and
                  then made a universal and particular application of it.
               "I had noticed that the king, who stood close before me, and never once took his
                  eyes off me, could not keep the tears from pouring down his cheeks; and I had
                  scarce uttered the word 'Amen,' when he said to me, 'Now come down from your
                  pulpit; you can keep the black coat, and all it contains. You had better inspect
                  the pockets, and see what you have got in them.'
               "During my discourse, I had noticed that one of them seemed heavier than the
                  other. I therefore put my hand into that one first, and who could picture my
                  astonishment, when I drew out a gold tabatière,
                  filled with ducats. I was silently regarding it, when the king said, 'That is a
                  present from my wife; but now look, and see whether there is anything in the other
                  pocket;' and not yet able to utter a word through surprise, I drew out my
                  appointment as dean, signed by the king's own hand."
               "How is that possible? Such a thing was never heard of," the old pastor exclaimed,
                  as he raised his hands to heaven. "My son a dean! A candidate and private in the
                  Grenadiers a dean! Yes! now I understand why you sent to tell us you would visit
                  us in company with the dean's lady. But not to ask your poor old father to the
                  wedding—as if you were ashamed of him—that's unpardonable."
               "Did I know anything about my marriage?" the son continued: "but listen
                  further."
               "I naturally tried, after all these fabulous events, to murmur out my thanks, but
                  was interrupted by the king, who said, 'Now come up to the palace; you can eat
                  your soup with us, and the regimental chaplain must accompany you.'
               "Giddy with the thought of all that had happened, I followed with the chaplain,
                  who was hardly less astonished than I was, the king and his suite to the palace,
                  and as soon as we had entered the audience-room, where all the court was assembled
                  together with his majesty and this young lady, the king advanced, and asked
                  me,
               "'Who does he think he has to thank for all this?'
               "I answered, with a low bow,
               "'Besides God, my most gracious king, and his most illustrious consort.'
               "To which his majesty remarked,
               "'There he's right; but look ye here, this young and charming woman did the most
                  for him. Has he nothing to say to her? She is not proud, and I know not married.
                  What does he think of her? He's now a dean, and has his pocket full of ducats.
                  Will he try his luck, and fancy he is all alone with her?'
               "Half with joy and hope, I raised my eyes, and looked at the poor girl, who was
                  blushing and trembling before me, and who could not raise her eyes from the
                  ground.
               "All were silent, though at intervals a slight sound of laughter could be heard in
                  the room. In spite of all my good
                  fortune, I was even more embarrassed than I had been an hour before when forced to
                  mount the drums; but I collected myself, and in a few moments said,
               "'His majesty the king, to whom I owe all my good fortune, has inspired me with
                  the courage to ask you, before this great assembly, whether you will accompany me
                  in my wanderings on the troubled path of life, as the angel Raphael formerly
                  guided the youthful Tobias?'
               "She immediately gave me her hand, silent and trembling, which I pressed with
                  ardor to my lips, and her majesty had scarcely bidden God to bless us, when the
                  king added,
               "'Regimental chaplain, come hither and marry them. Afterwards we'll have our
                  dinner; but I must get them off my hands to-day.'
               "The chaplain, with a deep bow, remarked,
               "'It is impossible, your majesty; the young couple have not been asked in
                  church.'
               "'Nonsense!' the king objected; 'I asked them myself long ago. Come,
                  and marry them as quickly as you can, for I am hungry. Next Sunday you can ask
                  them in church as many times as you like.'
               "Although the chaplain urged various reasons, all was of no avail. The marriage
                  took place that very hour, and my parents can now see why it was impossible for me
                  to invite them."
               "I really must be dreaming," the old pastor now said; "why it is stranger than any
                  story in the 'Arabian Nights!' A grenadier made a dean! But what did the members
                  of the consistory say to it? I cannot imagine."
               "They kept me so long," the young man replied, "or I should have come
                  to share my joy with you eight days ago. I had scarcely announced myself, and
                  handed in my diploma, with a request to be ordained, when the gentlemen men, as
                  may be easily conceived, declared the whole affair impossible, and sought to
                  demonstrate this to his majesty in a long petition. The king returned it with
                  these words, written with his own hand, on the margin:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "'I have examined him myself. If he does not understand Latin I can
                              afford to keep some one who does. I do not understand Latin
                              myself.
                           
                              "'FREDERICK WILLIAM.'
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "As they did not dare to trouble the king again in the matter, they proceeded to
                  ordain me, after an examination, to which I voluntarily submitted."
               The young man thus ended his story, and our kind readers can easily imagine the
                  rest. We need only remark, that our hero made an excellent dean, and for many
                  years held the living of P——.
               In conclusion, we are bound to state, that the above anecdote is historically
                  true, and that we have merely repeated the family tradition. Still we thought it
                  better to refrain from giving the real names, as the descendants of our
                  illustrious grenadier might not desire the story to be publicly known in connexion
                  with themselves.
            
            
               
               A Story of Sweden.
               CHRISTINA of Sweden, only child and successor to Gustavus Adolphus, the Lion of
                  the North, and right arm, as he was called, of the Protestant Faith, ascended the
                  throne of her ancestors at a very early age. She was a woman of considerable
                  talents, but more remarkable for energy of character, and an indomitable will;
                  qualities which she inherited from her father, and which her position, as the
                  uncontrolled head of an almost absolute monarchy, nursed into more than masculine
                  strength. Her wilfulness always displayed itself in a rash, though sometimes in a
                  generous way; and in one of her fits of the latter kind, ere she advanced far in
                  life, she formally resigned her crown, for the good, as she imagined, of her
                  people. The sacrifice was soon repented of, but too late for retrieval, and she
                  spent her latter days in retirement. It was this extraordinary woman's leading
                  wish, when on the throne, to be compared to Elizabeth of England, and she imitated
                  that princess even in her cold-hearted and unworthy coquetries. Hereby hangs the
                  tale we have now to tell.
               The young queen of Sweden gave a magnificent fête or masquerade in her palace at
                  Stockholm. This fête had a peculiar character, and one which doubled its splendor
                  and attractions, while exhibiting, at the same time, the ruling foible of the
                  heroine of the north. Christina wished, for one night, to have the pleasure of
                  openly and expressly bearing the character of the English princess, and to
                  resuscitate around her all that was brilliant and distinguished at the court of
                  her model. For this purpose she had given orders that her own courtiers should
                  assume for the time the characters of the various men of note in Elizabeth's
                  reign, and, in particular cases, she conferred on individuals the honor of
                  assigning to them the parts they were to play. This was rather a delicate point,
                  it must be remembered; for such parts as those of Essex and Leicester had a
                  significance attached to them which could not escape remark. Any old statesman
                  might play Burleigh, as easily as is done in Mr. Puff's famous drama; but no
                  common man durst assume the character of either of the two noblemen before
                  mentioned. A modest aspirant for royal favor, however, might venture on the garb
                  of a Raleigh, and more than one young courtier did appear in the guise of Sir
                  Walter on this brilliant evening. The Swedish queen was delighted with the result
                  of her project. A strict etiquette had been established for the regulation of
                  costume, and in order to give a better rule of guidance in this particular,
                  Christina had been at the pains to send for portraits of all the principal
                  personages to be represented. Thus the verisimilitude of the scene was
                  perfect.
               Among the individuals who attracted most interest on this occasion, by their
                  appearance and manners, were a young cavalier and an elegant woman, who kept much
                  beside one another during the evening. They were both distinguished for the
                  high-bred ease and grace of their movements, and this circumstance alone,
                  independently of the language in which they spoke to each other, might have served to mark them as foreigners. They
                  were both, indeed, from France. They seemed to be on the most confidential terms;
                  but there was one notable point of discrepancy apparent between them. The lady
                  seemed willing and even desirous to show herself openly in the crowd, whereas her
                  companion evidently sought to keep himself as much as possible out of the common
                  eye, and, in particular, to avoid the notice of the queen, as she moved from place
                  to place in the splendid assembly. Ultimately the young cavalier appeared to
                  succeed in bending his companion to his wishes on this subject, and the pair
                  retired to the recess of one of the lofty windows, where they commenced an
                  animated conversation, though in low tones. Young and light-hearted, and
                  possessing the spirited temperament of their common country, with a full share of
                  its turn for raillery, they scanned from their secluded nook the whole of the vast
                  assembly, and subjected every one who caught their eyes to a witty but
                  good-humored review.
               "Ah," said the lady, "look at that little Leicester; what think you of him?"
               "Poor fellow! he does not see that the queen wished to make a caricature of him,
                  by putting him into such a garb!" said the gentleman in return.
               "Lord Burleigh's representative," continued the lady, "has got the
                     wig at least—but nothing more."
               "And see," rejoined her companion, "how Sir Christopher Hatton bears himself? The
                  English cavalier, it is said, could dance well, but his personator is pleased to
                  make himself a walking-minuet."
               In such a style did the cavalier and the lady chat for one another's amusement in
                  the window recess. At last, the lady, with an appearance of nonchalance, but with
                  a tone of voice that betrayed some deeper interest in the matter, said to her
                  companion:—"Apropos—the queen herself—how do you like her?"
               "The queen!" replied the cavalier in a low voice, casting around him a troubled
                  glance.
               "Yes," continued the lady; "do you think she resembles Elizabeth of England?"
               "Between us—just as much as Madame Laura resembles Maria
                     Theresa of France!" was the youth's answer.
               As the last words left his lips, he grew deadly pale. His companion alone seemed
                  to enjoy the remark. "Admirable!" cried she, and signalized her sense of the joke
                  which was conveyed to her by the words, by a hearty laugh.
               But her mirth received a sudden check, as her eye fell on the personage who now
                  stood in front of her and her companion.
               "Who is this Madame Laura?" said the Queen Christina, for it was she
                  herself who now appeared before the cavalier and the lady, having overheard all
                  that had passed.
               At this question the cavalier, previously much agitated, was compelled to lean on
                  the window. But he recovered himself sufficiently to reply, though with an altered
                  and faltering voice, to the queen's interrogatory: "Madame Laura, please your
                  majesty, is a Parisian lady, who has the honor to resemble the Queen of
                  France—both in dignity of manners and beauty."
               Christina looked on the speaker with an air of doubt and indecision. "Count
                  d'Harcourt," said she after a pause, biting her lips at the same time, "this is a
                  trait of French gallantry for which the Queen of Sweden may thank you at some
                  future period."
               Nodding slightly and haughtily to the count's fair companion panion, Christina then turned away, and with
                  majestic step moved to a spot where a band of courtiers were at the card-table.
                  Meanwhile the whisper passed from tongue to tongue: "the queen has spoken
                     particularly to the young Frenchman; his fortune is made."
               The object of their remarks, on the other hand, was at that moment muttering to
                  himself: "I am ruined—lost!" And taking leave of his former companion, almost
                  without a word on either side, the Count d'Harcourt left the assembly.
               Christina, after speaking as has been related, went directly to the ambassador of
                  France, whom she drew aside from the crowd. "I have a favor to ask of your
                  excellency," said she, "under the seal of secresy."
               "Your majesty has but to speak," said the diplomatist gravely, "and I shall be
                  proud to obey you to the utmost of my power."
               "I assure you," returned the queen, "your power will not be severely taxed at
                  present. It is but a trifle—a bagatelle—that I am interested about just now; but I
                  think you are the only person who can gratify my wish. I desire but to know who
                  and what a certain Parisian lady is, who bears the name of Madame
                     Laura?"
               "Madame Laura—Madame Laura!" rejoined the ambassador, turning his eyes on the
                  ground.
               "Yes, Madame Laura," said the queen impatiently; "does your excellency know
                  her?"
               Upon the diplomatist avouching that he never in his life had heard of such a lady,
                  Christina tapped the ground restlessly with her foot, and appeared annoyed.
               "Then your excellency," said she, at length, with an imperious voice, "will have
                  the goodness to favor me by finding out the lady. Let an express set out for Paris
                  this night, and return without a moment's delay, with full details respecting the
                  position and character of this Madame Laura."
               The ambassador bowed respectfully, and retired to give immediate orders to a
                  courier to proceed on this extraordinary mission.
               It has been said that the Queen of Sweden imitated, or at least resembled,
                  Elizabeth in her fashion of coquetting with some favored noble of her court. The
                  personage on whom, at the date of our story, the favor of Christina seemed to have
                  fallen, was that young Frenchman, who, exiled for political reasons from his own
                  country, had come to Sweden in the hope of obtaining military service. The queen
                  received him with peculiar marks of distinction, gave him a commission in her
                  life-guards, and conducted herself towards him, altogether, in such a manner as
                  would have given even a very modest man reason to believe himself an object of
                  marked regard. To a young man of twenty-five, bold and ambitious, such a
                  conviction was likely to be flattering and seductive. We cannot say that it was
                  not so in the case of Count d'Harcourt, but whatever might be his dreams of
                  ambition, his affections had lighted on another object than the sovereign of
                  Sweden. This was the Baroness Helena of Steinberg, a young and beautiful
                  country-woman of his own, and the widow of a deceased Swedish noble. The baroness
                  returned D'Harcourt's passion warmly, and the jealous eye of love soon advised her
                  of the potent rival with whom she had to combat for his affection. On the occasion
                  of the masked-ball, Christina had herself deigned to suggest the character of
                  Essex to the young Count d'Harcourt. The baroness, when informed of the
                  circumstance, saw its full significance, and was bold enough to venture on
                  answering the hint of the queen by a covert allusion of the same practical kind.
                  Finding a portrait of Lady Sydney, widow of Sir Philip, whom Essex had
                     privately vately made his countess,
                  the baroness had assumed the character of that lady at the risk of giving offence.
                  Hence the unwillingness of D'Harcourt to attract attention at the masquerade, the
                  baroness being then his companion. Well would it have been for the young noble had
                  he been equally cautious with regard to his speech! But, in reality, the costume
                  of Christina, which had called from him the mysterious remark about Madame Laura,
                  was somewhat ridiculous. The numberless frills of Elizabeth's usual dress, with
                  all its other stiff and stately points, were very much out of place on the
                  restless, careless, and petulant queen of Sweden. Perhaps she was partly
                  suspicious of this on reflection, and the more galling was the idea of being an
                  object of ridicule to the man she favored, and, above all, to her rival in his
                  regard.
               The impatient queen received an answer from Paris in eight days, so actively did
                  the courier fulfil the orders given. "Madame Laura," said the document which he
                  brought, "is a court-lady who has become mad. Her mania consists in a
                  belief that she is queen of France, and in her endeavoring to rival the real
                  sovereign, Maria Theresa, in all her dresses and decorations. The poor woman
                  passes her life in this sole occupation. The queen never assumes a habit, which is
                  not seen immediately afterwards on Madame Laura. As she is as inoffensive as
                  ridiculous, nobody meddles with her, and she is everywhere known in Paris by the
                  name of the queen's caricature." This despatch had additional details
                  of the same kind, and concluded by exhibiting a portraiture of poor Madame Laura,
                  dressed as Maria Theresa, and looking inexpressibly ridiculous.
               The rage of the queen of Sweden knew no bounds. She had conceived that there was
                  some little point about D'Harcourt's comparison somewhat unfavorable, but to find
                  that she had been compared altogether to a vain and ridiculous madwoman—she, the
                  heroine and pride of the north—she, who had almost allowed the author of this
                  gross insult to know that she loved him—she, to be an object of contempt to this
                  strange youth and his Lady Sydney, the woman for whom he seemed to reject
                  herself—such a thought was torturing to the heart of the proud and wilful
                  princess. "Wretches!" she exclaimed, "this is the comparison ye would have had me
                  to believe a compliment!"
               Filled with such emotions, the queen again chanced to look at the detailed account
                  of Madame Laura. "Innocent as the madness of the lady really is," said one part of
                  the paper, "she is an austere sovereign, and by no means inclined to admit
                  clemency among the royal virtues. She speaks ever of executing justice." The
                  passage tallied with the state of the queen's mind. "Yes," cried she, "if I am
                  ridiculous, like her, I will be similar to her in all things." Then she set
                  herself to discover a fit chastisement for D'Harcourt. None appeared to her
                  sufficiently heavy, sharp, or sudden. In this temper passed the day on which she
                  received this galling document from Paris.
               Sleep, or the calm of night, brought a change over her feelings. She arose with an
                  altered mind from her couch, and in place of an order for his confinement in a
                  dungeon, she sent to D'Harcourt, on that morning, the brevet of the additional
                  rank of lieutenant-colonel.
               The count, who had been preparing himself for leaving Stockholm, was surprised and
                  confounded on receiving this intelligence. He was the more so, as he had not the
                  least doubt but that the queen must have discovered the secret of his allusion to
                  Madame Laura from some of the Frenchmen about the court. The conduct of Christina
                  thus appeared to him in a most magnanimous light, and a light very dangerous to
                  his fidelity to the Baroness de Steinberg. Still more was this the case when, after the lapse
                  of but a few months, he was raised to the rank of colonel, and, subsequently, on
                  the occasion of his performance of a gallant action, was honored with the rank of
                  general, and the key of chamberlain of the household. He was induced also to
                  become a naturalized Swede, as a step to future greatness.
               All eyes were now turned upon the rising young Frenchman, and it was thought that
                  the partnership, if not a higher honor, was within his grasp. He was in a trying
                  position. He was charmed with the queen's generosity of heart, and believed that
                  she must love him, though nothing but her kindly actions, and it may be her looks,
                  had indicated it hitherto; and he had never dared to enter on such a subject.
                  Indeed, dazzled as he was by the prospect of personal favor from a young,
                  powerful, and not unlovely princess, D'Harcourt still felt his heart to be with
                  the Baroness de Steinberg. His fidelity to the latter and his ambition came at
                  length to a direct trial—a struggle of superiority. The Baroness de Steinberg had
                  seen, with mingled feelings of pain and pleasure, the elevation of her lover, but
                  the sense of pain predominated. She saw that ambition was estranging him from her.
                  One day, accordingly, she wrote to him, announcing her intention to leave
                  Stockholm that evening; but plainly indicating, that if he yet loved her enough to
                  retain her, she would not go. At the same moment, almost, the count received a
                  letter from the queen, desiring his immediate presence at a private consultation
                  with her council. This was equivalent to an announcement of a new honor awaiting
                  him. The count was deeply agitated by this dilemma, but ambition, or what he would
                  fain have called duty, gained the day. He neglected the invitation of
                  the baroness, and went to the palace, seals and portfolios dancing before his
                  mind's eye by the way.
               The queen was seated in council when he was announced. All smiled upon the
                  favorite; but Christina signified her wish for the whole to retire, and D'Harcourt
                  was left alone with her. She was pale, and he was also agitated. It seemed to him
                  as if the moment was come when a crown was to fall on his head. After a pause, the
                  queen lifted a portfolio, stamped with her royal arms, the symbol of supreme if
                  not royal power, and holding it out, said: "Do you desire to see it?"
               The smile of the queen made the intoxicated young noble interpret this into: "Do
                  you love me?" and he fell on his knees, exclaiming in answer: "Yes, I love you as
                  much as I reverence and admire you!"
               He continued in this strain for a short time, when the queen interrupted him—and
                  what an interruption!
               "Enough!" cried she, in a tone that froze the blood in the count's heart—a tone
                  resembling that of a player who casts aside a mask he has worn for a time. The
                  dismayed count would have risen, but she imperiously signed to him to remain. "At
                  length," continued she, in a tone of concentrated bitterness—"at length I see you
                     there—and the hour of my revenge is come!" D'Harcourt fell back,
                  with his head upon a fauteuil, dumb and
                  motionless. "Yes," resumed Christina, "I knew that you loved me, but
                  I wished to hear you declare it, as I can now say, as a woman, what I
                  might long since have said as a queen, that I—scorn and despise
                  you!"
               A groan was all the reply of the deceived and unfortunate count.
               "Yes, I have raised you," continued the queen, "only for the enjoyment of this
                  hour. Elizabeth raised the Earl of Essex step by step to place and honor. So have
                  I done by you. But there is a further step. If I cannot be Elizabeth, as Madame
                  Laura, whom I resemble so much, and who
                  is equally cruel as mad, I may fairly finish the similitude. You remember the end
                  of Essex?"
               "Death!" exclaimed the agitated count, involuntarily.
               "Yes, death on the scaffold," said the queen. "I have taken care to naturalize you
                  in Sweden, and you are at my discretion. But I will conclude this affair in a
                  manner more worthy of Madame Laura, and consequently of me," added Christina,
                  bitterly. As she spoke, she summoned the counsellors to re-enter. "This man," said
                  she to them, "is insane. Let him be conveyed to the madhouse!"
               Dumb with horror, the Count d'Harcourt was taken from the royal presence.
               Insanity really attacked the unhappy man. But from the tenderness of one woman he
                  found a partial remedy for the cruelty of another. On hearing of his doom, which
                  was mitigated in time, the Baroness de Steinberg, forgetful of all her wrongs,
                  flew back to Stockholm. Her future days were dedicated to the solacement of the
                  broken-spirited Count d'Harcourt.
            
            
               Major O'Shaughnessy's Adventure on the Duke's Moors.
               MAJOR O'SHAUGHNESSY was of ancient Milesian origin; his descent was as
                  irreproachable as his honor; his rank was taken from a militia regiment, the South
                  Cork, in which he had served with distinction, and acquired that profound
                  knowledge of men and manners for which throughout life he was so remarkable. Six
                  feet high, broad-shouldered, and of athletic frame, the major was a bold rider,
                  and an unerring shot. His stud was the admiration of the whole county, and he had
                  a breed of bull-terriers not to be matched in Ireland. There were few men of his
                  time whom he was not able to walk down, still fewer whom he could not drive under
                  the table; generous, brave, and hospitable, even to a fault. Every description of
                  field sport was a pleasant pastime to him—he delighted and excelled in them all.
                  But the darling passion of his life was grouse-shooting.
               It came to pass, one fine evening towards the end of autumn, that the major, who,
                  accompanied by his friend, Tom Wildman, had been making a tour of the
                     Highlands, arrived at the village of
                  D——. It was their intention to have proceeded some miles further, but a brief
                  deliberation with the driver having satisfied them that the accommodations which
                  the place afforded were tolerably comfortable, they agreed to halt for the night,
                  and bivouacked at the Cat and Bagpipes, a hostelrie which stood at the further
                  extremity of the village. The scenery was such as Scotland alone can produce in
                  perfection—hills, blooming with purple heather, rose in gentle undulations on
                  every side; a fine stream, now foaming over rocks, now eddying into deep still
                  pools, swept along in its course to the sea, which might be descried sparkling in
                  the distance. The hamlet, consisting of a few scattered houses, lay snugly
                  sheltered in a quiet nook; the hills by which it was environed forming, as it
                  were, the base of a continuous range of lofty mountains, that sloped westward. To
                  those who look with a painter's or a poet's eye upon the beauties of nature, it
                  would have been difficult to present a landscape more interesting, or more
                  abounding in varied charms, than that upon which the travellers gazed as they
                  wandered forth to loiter away the tedious half hour preceding dinner. But the
                  major cared little for scenery, however picturesque, nor, to his shame be it
                  spoken, was he a lover of the fine arts in the very least; so as his eye roved
                  abroad over the wide expanse of purple heather, the low stunted coppice-wood, and
                  the patches of corn land jotted about at intervals like the squares of a
                  chess-board, his whole soul was filled with quite another admiration, intense
                  enough after its kind, which will be best explained by the following exclamation,
                  that burst as it were involuntarily from his lips:
               "By Jove, Tom! what splendid shooting there must be on those hills!"
               "Likely enough," replied his companion, who was not a man of many words, but
                  uncommonly fond of fly-fishing (in which he was an adept), of smoking tobacco, and
                  other amusements suited to a contemplative nature.
               "Fine river, too—eh, Tom? Look at the tail of that pool; if there's a salmon in
                  all Scotland, he's there, waiting for his dinner, as we are."
               "Claret-colored body, pheasant's wing, red hackle underneath—that's the color
                  would 'tickle his fancy.'"
               "Here's the color for us, Tom!" the major said, as, after the lapse of some short
                  time, which the pair spent in lounging upon the bridge, he observed a waiter
                  signalling to them from the door of the village inn.
               Nothing could have been better than the dinner which they found awaiting their
                  return; delicious salmon that an hour ago had been swimming in the silver lustre
                  of his prime; delicate mountain mutton, washed down by amber ale, which it was a
                  pleasure to look at as well as to drink, formed a repast to which both did ample
                  justice. The major felt supremely happy and comfortable; and, as he lighted a
                  cigar, said to his companion—
               "Suppose, Tom, we have up the landlord, and ask if it's possible, for love or
                  money, to get a day over those mountains?"
               "With all my heart," replied Tom Wildman, who was addressing himself to the
                  manufacture of a bowl of punch.
               The proprietor of the Cat and Bagpipes, being summoned accordingly, soon made his
                  appearance, and a few minutes sufficed to satisfy the major that the object of his
                  aspirations was one, apparently, impossible of attainment. The mountains, it
                  appeared, belonged to the Duke of B———; they were the best preserved in the
                  kingdom, no one ever drawing trigger upon them except his grace, and such intimate
                  friends as were occasionally partakers of the ducal hospitality. The keeper, a
                  certain Sandy Macpherson pherson, was
                  of tried integrity—the terror of all poachers, cockney tourists, and trespassers
                  of every kind; money could not bribe, nor menace, even followed up by assault and
                  battery, dismay him; he had refused with scorn ten golden guineas, offered by a
                  sporting gent from London, and had thrashed, single-handed, three Oxford
                  undergraduates, who had tried to force a passage through a certain portion of the
                  dominions intrusted to his care.
               "It don't look very promising, eh, major?" Tom Wildman said, when the door had
                  closed upon the departed host.
               "Not very; nothing could be more unsatisfactory: so we shall have to fall back
                  upon the salmon, if we remain here a day or two; and we will, Tom, for I know your
                  heart is set upon trying your favorite claret body with the red hackle."
               The quaint old Izaac Walton himself could scarcely have desired a more propitious
                  day for the exercise of his gentle craft than that which succeeded. Tom Wildman
                  having screwed together his rod, issued forth, accompanied by his friend with a
                  landing net. Passing over the bridge, they strolled leisurely along the river's
                  side, in the direction of a mountain glen at no great distance, with the intention
                  of fishing downwards to the bridge, in the first instance, before they proceeded
                  to investigate that portion of deeper water which flowed between the village and
                  the sea.
               They had not proceeded very far upon their voyage of discovery, when a nice, snug
                  house, standing in a quiet, out-of-the-way spot, among the hills, was descried at
                  a little distance. It had the appearance of one of those old-fashioned comfortable
                  farm-houses seldom seen out of Scotland; a tract of highly cultivated ground lay
                  behind it, skirted by a belt of Scotch firs, which seemed to thrive like hardy
                  denizens of these mountain solitudes. While our friends were engaged in making
                  these observations, a man was seen rapidly descending a long stubble field, which
                  sloped from the house down to the river's side.
               "I shouldn't at all wonder, now, Tom, if this were the redoubtable keeper himself;
                  there's something sporting in his trim, ain't there?" said the major.
               And so there was, nor would it be easy to find a better specimen of his class than
                  he who was now approaching them. Sandy Macpherson, for the major was right in his
                  conjecture, looked the very beau-ideal of a
                  gamekeeper; his figure was tall, but active and sinewy; the well proportioned
                  limbs, and light springy step, were those of a man used to breast the mountain
                  sides; a face, bronzed by exposure to the sun and wind, was lighted up by eyes
                  twinkling with shrewdness and intelligence; huge red whiskers met underneath his
                  chin, almost covering his neck, which was unconfined by any kerchief; his attire
                  consisted of a velveteen jacket with gaiters and leggins, and his head was covered
                  by a Scotch bonnet. A glance from the major, which took in all these outward
                  signs, convinced him that any one who calculated upon taking the smallest
                  advantage of Sandy, would, as the saying is, have to get up early in the
                  morning.
               "Fine day, gentlemen," said he whom we have just described.
               "Beautiful," replied Tom Wildman.
               "Ye hae leave in writin' from the duke to come on these grounds, otherwise my
                  orders is verra strict," the keeper said, in a civil tone.
               "We have no leave whatever, nor did we know the river was preserved," replied Tom
                  Wildman.
               "Nae mair it is, until ye come upon the heather. His grace doesna fash himsel'
                  about the fishes, but he's unco particular for fear o' the birds bein'
                  disturbed."
               
               "Well, we must turn back again, that's all; and perhaps you'll be good enough, for
                  I suppose you are the duke's keeper, to show us whereabouts is the boundary, which
                  we shall take care not to pass for the future."
               The honest keeper pointed to a turn in the river, where the moorland terminated,
                  and was about to take his departure, when the fisherman requested to have the
                  benefit of his advice as to what flies were best suited for the river, and whether
                  his favorite claret-colored body would be likely to please the taste of the trout.
                  This produced an inspection of the book of flies, as well as a discussion upon the
                  various topics connected with the art. The piscatorial opinions of the keeper were
                  listened to with the utmost respect and deference by the two sportsmen, who made
                  themselves in short so agreeable to their new acquaintance, that when they parted,
                  it was upon the condition he would look in when the day's sport had concluded, and
                  inspect some fishing gear of a novel construction.
               The river did not belie the expectations its appearance had created—the trout rose
                  merrily. The fisherman filled his creel; evening came; and as the major, with his
                  friend, sat after dinner in the little parlor, speculating if the keeper would
                  make his appearance, a knock was heard at the door, and the subject of their
                  contemplations entered the apartment. Tom Wildman insisted upon his taking a
                  chair, filled him a huge bumper of punch out of the bowl which steamed upon the
                  table, and opened his repository of flies, while the Major was not behindhand in
                  civility, and requested their guest to pronounce an opinion upon a new box of
                  choice cigars. The punch was good; the tobacco was better; what Scotchman, what
                  mortal man, could long withstand the combination of their genial influences? so,
                  by imperceptible degrees, the reserve of Mr. Macpherson thawed away, he was quite
                  at his ease, and grew not only communicative, but loquacious, and as he swallowed
                  tumbler after tumbler of the inspiring liquor, he launched forth into praises of
                  the nobleman, his master, his own dogs, guns, and all the paraphernalia
                  appertaining to his calling.
               The major, with that intuitive sagacity for which, in common with his countrymen,
                  he was eminently remarkable, arranged at once within his own mind a plan of
                  operations which he fondly trusted would lead to success; he saw with how shrewd a
                  gentleman he had to deal, and although Mr. Macpherson was, to all outward
                  appearance, perfectly off his guard, and thoroughly warmed by the generous
                  influences to which he was exposed, the major could at times detect a shrewd
                  glance, which looking quite through him, showed an intelligence which all the
                  liquor in the world could neither cloud nor baffle; he affected therefore a total
                  and entire ignorance of all matters relating to field sports, hinted delicately
                  that he delighted in picturesque scenery, and occasionally occupied his leisure
                  hours by taking rough sketches, while he carried the landing-net for his
                  piscatorial companion.
               "Gran' views are verra weel in their way, verra weel, but hech, sirs, to my mind
                  there's nae sic sight in natur', as to see twa weel broke setters on a pack o'
                  grouse!" and as he spake the keeper's features glowed with the enthusiasm of his
                  calling.
               "I have seen a bull terrier worry a rat, but I can't say I liked it much," replied
                  the major, with an effrontery which did credit to his powers of face.
               "Worry a rot! dang it, mon—beg pardon, sir—but dang it, is that a' ye ken? ye
                  dinna think we kill grouse by catchin' them, and worryin' them like stots!"
               "What's the use of dogs, then, what do you do with them?" the major said, lighting a fresh cigar, and
                  smiling with the apparent guilelessness of an infant.
               Sandy Macpherson thus addressed, looked first at Tom Wildman as if to see what he
                  thought of his friend's lamentable ignorance, but that gentleman's countenance
                  affording no index whatever as to the nature of his cogitations, he turned then to
                  the major, who regarded him with an air of innocent surprise most comical to
                  behold. The worthy keeper could control himself no longer, and gave vent to his
                  feelings in a burst of laughter, so sudden, loud, and continuous, that the glasses
                  danced upon the table.
               "What amuses you, my friend?" the major said.
               "Hech, sir, to think o' a gentleman come to your years an' never heerd tell o'
                  settin' a grouse; I canna believe it," and Sandy laughed till the tears stood in
                  his eyes.
               "It would make a pretty picture, I suppose."
               "Picture', sir, hech!"
               But the result of the dialogue may be told in a few words. The ignorance assumed
                  by the major was so admirably acted, that the suspicions of Mr. Macpherson began
                  gradually to die away, in proportion as he warmed under the genial influences of
                  the punch and cigars. Thus it came to pass, when the deepening shadows warned him
                  it was time to bend his steps homewards, he gave his hosts to understand that,
                  having occasion on the following morning to procure some grouse to send up to
                  London, he would be extremely happy if the major could make it convenient to take
                  a walk along with him, in order that he might have an opportunity of satisfying
                  himself by personal observation, that grouse were killed in a scientific and
                  sportsmanlike fashion, and not, as he supposed, worried "like rots."
               That night the major slept but little; his brain, fertile in expedients, was
                  occupied in revolving by what means it was possible for him to attain his
                  wished-for object. He at length hit upon a device, so extraordinary, that it was
                  little wonder the keeper looked at him from head to foot with genuine amazement,
                  when they met on the following morning, for never in his experience had he seen a
                  gentleman similarly attired for an excursion on the moors. In a blue dress coat
                  with gilt buttons, a white waistcoat, fawn colored jean unmentionables, spotless
                  white stockings, and shoes of varnished leather, had the major carefully arrayed
                  himself—a well brushed white hat was stuck jauntily on his head; in one hand he
                  bore a French cane with a gold top, in the other a small sketch-book.
               "Ye dinna mean to say ye're for travellin' the moors in sic a dress as yon?" Mr.
                  Macpherson said, when his astonishment had sufficiently subsided to enable him to
                  speak.
               "Why, as I told you yesterday evening, I don't know much about these matters, and
                  the fact is, I've always been accustomed to hear of grouse-shooting as an
                  amusement, partaken in by noblemen and great people, so I thought a man should
                  dress for it, as if he were going to a ball."
               "Weel a weel, ha'e a care o' the quaighs, that's all, ye'll be in the de'il's ain
                  pickle afore ye're mony hours older. I wadna gi'e a siller saxpence for the hail
                  claes on yer back when ye come hame at e'en, that's sure at any rate," replied the
                  keeper. But the major, who would willingly have bought success at a much higher
                  rate than the price of a suit of clothes, was quite prepared for the trifling
                  sacrifice, so they went on their way rejoicing; the keeper's boy, a red-legged
                  young Celt, with a huge creel strapped on his back, casting many an admiring
                  glance at the gorgeous apparel of the strange gentleman, about whose legs Flora,
                  the red setter, kept sniffing, as if she greatly desired a taste of their quality
                  for her morning's meal, her master muttering to himself:
               
               "A weel, I ha'e seen some strange sights in my day, but de'il tak me if ever I saw
                  a chiel come out to walk the moors in dancin' shoon afore."
               A stiffish walk of some miles over the heather, which by no means added to the
                  brilliancy of the major's costume, brought the party to a beautiful mountain glen,
                  round which lay a wide expanse of ground, broken into undulating little knolls,
                  which the experienced eye of the major saw at a glance was splendid feeding ground
                  for birds. Nor was he deceived; the dogs had not been very long uncoupled, when it
                  was manifest they were on game.
               "Ho, Don! steady! ha'e a care, good dowg," whispered the keeper, as Don, throwing
                  back his fine head, began to proceed with more caution; the crafty major,
                  repressing as well as he could his admiration, said, in an alarmed tone,
               "Why, what's the matter with the animal? he has got his tail as stiff as a poker;
                  he ain't going mad, I hope? If you think so, shoot him! for heaven's sake, Sandy,
                  shoot him at once."
               "Wheest!" replied the keeper, opening his eyes with amazement, and cocking both
                  barrels. "Look at Flora there, may be she's mad too."
               The training of the dogs was perfect. Flora lay motionless behind the setter, who
                  now stood stock-still, every hair on his back bristling up like porcupines'
                  quills; the red-legged attendant had lain down on the heather, whence the top of
                  his head alone was visible.
               "Noo, then! keep a wee bit behind me, or them fine colors o' yours will do
                  mischief; I can see the old birds glancin' through the heather," whispered Mr.
                  Macpherson, adding softly, "Go on, Don; go on, good dowg!"
               The setter, at his master's bidding, crept quietly forwards, and up at their very
                  feet sprang a magnificent pack of grouse, the old cock leading the van, and
                  crowing lustily—whirr! whirr! whirr! the major thought they would never stop.
               Sandy Macpherson's brown barrels glanced for an instant in the sun, flash! down
                  went the old cock with a heavy "thud" on the heather, a whole shower of his
                  feathers floating in the morning air. Pop! and over went a brace of his
                  companions, a wave of the keeper's hand, and motionless as stones lay the dogs,
                  while their master proceeded to load.
               Much as Major O'Shaughnessy had admired the training of the dogs, as displayed in
                  their first performance, their subsequent conduct was beyond all praise, and he
                  confessed to himself that anything more perfect than their pointing, or than the
                  shooting of their master, he had never seen. The flat tract of ground had
                  abundance of game—each single bird, as it got up, was knocked over with a
                  precision that never erred; but it was in disposing of a pack that the keeper's
                  coolness and steadiness of hand were displayed to the greatest advantage; he never
                  threw away a shot, but singled out the old cock, picked him off with his first
                  barrel, reserving the second to intercept the flight of any unlucky straggler who
                  lingered behind his fellows. Not a word was spoken—the dogs and master understood
                  each other perfectly. When the brown barrels were raised and fired, up went his
                  hand, and down went the setters, never attempting to stir until he had reloaded.
                  Then the click of the hammer, as he cocked his piece, was sufficient signal for
                  them; they understood it at once, and went off quartering their ground as before.
                  By the time the long flat tract of heather had been thoroughly beaten, the spoils
                  being collected by the red-legged urchin, were found to amount to twelve
                  brace.
               "Weel, sir, what do you think o' grouse shooting? nice sport, ain't it?" inquired the keeper,
                  depositing himself at full length beside the major, and laying his gun down on the
                  heather.
               "Uncommonly interesting, but by no means comfortable," replied the major, casting
                  a rueful glance at his nether man, which had suffered not a little. The varnished
                  shoes were rent in twain, the white stockings and nice jean pantaloons were
                  plastered with mud, and the whole aspect of his companion so miserable, that the
                  compassion of Sandy Macpherson overpowered his more risible indications. The
                  roughest day will, however, wear to a close. After some further shooting, the
                  keeper declared the sport to be over; he had enough, he thought, for his purpose.
                  The spoils being counted were found to amount to twenty-five brace of magnificent
                  grouse, and the party prepared to bend their steps homewards.
               "Ha'e ye e'er tried a shot yer ainsel, noo?" inquired Mr. Macpherson, with some
                  interest, as they were descending a steep brae.
               "Yes, of course I have," replied the major, boldly.
               "Birds?" inquired the keeper.
               "Yes; birds, certainly."
               "Paitrich, maybe; or pheasant; a cock pheasant's a braw easy shot!"
               "'Twas at a cock-robin I fired," replied the major, with cool effrontery, "and by
                  Jove I missed him into the bargain."
               "Like to try your chance, sir, on a grouse now? he's a bigger mark," said the
                  keeper, with a hearty chuckle.
               "If I could only catch him sitting, and get near enough, I'd pepper him, by Jove I
                  would!" the major said.
               "That would be just clean murder, outright; if ye'd only let him up, and take
                  time, and hold the gun straight, ye couldna miss him."
               "Gad, I think I'd like to try, any how," replied the major.
               "Verra weel, and so ye shall when we're down this hill; I'll let Don awa' by
                  himself'; he'll nae be lang afore he finds ye a bird. Dang it, sir, I would like
                  just to see ye tumble an auld cock for the fun o' the thing," said Sandy
                  Macpherson.
               The party had not proceeded very far over the flat ground which lay at the foot of
                  the hill they had just traversed, when the red setter, released from his
                  four-footed companion, dropped slowly on the brow of a gentle eminence.
               "Noo," whispered the keeper, "here'll be a braw chance—stan' yer ground quietly
                  until I load; will ye ha'e the twa barrels? I think the ane will be enugh."
               "Wouldn't I have a better chance with the two?" inquired the major, shuddering
                  nervously, as if he had been seized with a fit of the ague.
               Sandy Macpherson smiled grimly as he loaded his favorite brown barrels, put on the
                  caps, cocked the piece, and handed it to the trembling gentleman at his side.
               There probably never was an erring mortal more sorely tried than the major at this
                  moment; the whole enthusiasm of his sporting nature was astir within him, as he
                  felt the gun in his hand, the heather under his foot, and saw the fine setter
                  motionless as a rock before him. How I could astonish Sandy, if the pack be a
                  strong one, he thought to himself; but no, I'll play the game out, it has cost me
                  trouble enough already; he advanced a few steps, and up got a tremendous pack of
                  grouse, all round him.
               "Lord save us!" shouted the major, as if terrified out of his senses.
               "Noo, man! noo! noo's the time; dang it they'll be awa," said Sandy.
               
               The major shut his teeth, and having previously closed his eyes, pointed the
                  muzzle to the firmament, pulled both triggers simultaneously, and dropped on his
                  nether end on the heather, as if he had been shot himself, while Sandy burst in a
                  guffaw of laughter, that made the echoes ring.
               "How many's down?" inquired the sportsman.
               "Nane but yer ain sel'; the de'il a feather ha'e ye touched; there gaes the auld
                  cock crawin', as if he was daft; he's laughin', an' nae wonder," the keeper
                  said.
               In a word, the acting of the crafty old campaigner was so good, that he thoroughly
                  deluded his companion into the belief he was as ignorant of the mysteries of
                  grouse-shooting as if he had been a shopman's apprentice, and never off the flags
                  of London; so, after dinner, which Mr. Macpherson had been persuaded to remain and
                  partake of, at the Cat and Bagpipes, when the punch had circulated pretty freely,
                  the conversation turned of course upon the exploits of the morning, which the
                  Scotchman narrated with great humor. The major took occasion to insinuate, that
                  the fault lay not so much in his shooting as in the gun, which had kicked him so
                  tremendously, he said, that he was unable to hold it straight!
               This was too great a trial of the keeper's patience, who, of course, stoutly
                  maintained the reputation of his favorite brown Bess, asserting, with a force of
                  logic which was difficult to overcome, that when he could kill with the piece
                  himself, it could not be her fault if, in other hands, a like result did not
                  follow.
               "Ah, Sandy, you cannot persuade me of that! A gun that kicks, hurts a fellow's
                  shoulder, and knocks him down, can never be a good gun, say what you will,"
                  persisted the major.
               "Whatna piece is there that wunna kick if a chiel pu' baith triggers thegither?
                  and as for knocking a mon doon, why, that's the fault o' the mon—no' o' the gun,"
                  said Sandy.
               "Well, well, when I go home again, I'll take lessons. I'll be able to shoot grouse
                  as well as you, Sandy, before I die."
               "Na, na, sir! some folks would ne'er ken the knack; ye're a gey stout-built
                  gentleman to look at, but ye ha'e na nerves, nane whatever," replied the keeper,
                  shaking his head.
               "If I had been only by myself, with no one to look on, I could have shot him, I'm
                  sure I could," said the major, as if asserting an abstract proposition, the truth
                  of which was indisputable.
               "Shot wha; no the auld cock, surely?" inquired Mr. Macpherson.
               "Yes, the old cock; I'd have done for him."
               "Na, ye wouldna shoot a haystack."
               "I'm blessed if I couldn't," interrupted the major.
               "I'm d—d if you could," shouted the keeper, slapping his huge hand upon the table,
                  until the glasses danced.
               The major smiled a smile which was peculiar to him, such a smile as might have
                  played over the Great Captain's iron visage when he saw the decisive moment had
                  come, and he said,
               "I'll bet you ten guineas I do it."
               "What! shoot a grouse?" inquired the keeper, eagerly.
               "Shoot a grouse—one, two, three, aye, four of them," shouted the major, thumping,
                  in his turn, the table with his fist.
               "Sittin', if Dick'll put salt on their tails," replied Sandy, with a grin of
                  contempt.
               "No, flying."
               "Hoot awa', mon, ye wadna do't in a twalmonth. Ye needna fash yersel' to stake yer
                  money."
               
               "Ten guineas I do!" thundered the major, flinging, as he spoke, the coin on the
                  table.
               "Ten pun', four grouse, flyin', and a' in the ane day; done, sir, I'll tak' ye
                  up," said Mr. Macpherson, clutching the tempter's hand.
               "Done," replied the major, returning the pressure. "But I must go out quietly by
                  myself; you'll have to lend me a dog too; you see I have learned something by the
                  morning's lesson; my friend here will, I have no doubt, stand the loan of an old
                  gun he carries about with him."
               "Dowg!" said the keeper, musingly, "I dinna ken how we'll manage about that; I
                  wadna trust the dowgs we had in the morn to any ither than my ain sel'; but stap,
                  I ha'e it; there's an auld pointer ayont, a gey good beast he was in his day; ye
                  shall ha'e him, an' Dick too, if ye like, to carry hame the birds," he added with
                  a grin.
               "Lots of powder and shot, too—eh, Sandy?"
               "A sack fu', if your honor pleases. I'll tell ye how we'll manage—on Saturday morn
                  I'm goin' to a fair, a gey piece off; you can just slip quietly out up the glen;
                  you ken whar you met me—I'll ha'e Dick wi' the auld pointer waiting for you there;
                  but, for the Lord's sake, sir, it must na be tauld to a living cre'tur. If it came
                  to the duke's ken I'd lose my place."
               The major having given a solemn pledge of secresy, Sandy Macpherson took his
                  departure, not a little elated at the prospect of winning ten guineas, and
                  perfectly satisfied that there was no danger whatever, except, perhaps, to Sancho,
                  the old pointer.
               Saturday morning came in due course, and a finer autumn day never dawned; there
                  had been a slight frost during the night, but the air, though bracing, was not so
                  keen, and a gentle breeze swept the heather, as Major O'Shaughnessy, determined to
                  be in good time, drew near to the keeper's lodge; when, who should come full upon
                  him but that functionary himself, jogging along on a Highland shelty.
               "Gude mornin', ye'll ha'e a braw day any how; but, Lord save us, wha's this!" and
                  the countenance of Mr. Macpherson, as his eye fell upon the major, underwent a
                  considerable alteration; and well it might, for a man of another fashion than the
                  over-dressed blundering companion of his former excursion stood before him now.
                  The major, who had calculated that the keeper would have taken his departure for
                  the fair long before his own arrival at the lodge, had arrayed himself in the
                  accurate sporting costume he usually wore when equipped for the moors—a loose,
                  single-breasted jacket of brown tweed, dark grey linen trousers, and well greased
                  brogues, formed his apparel; a silver dog-whistle hung suspended from his
                  buttonhole; a light "wide-awake" covered his head, and poised upon his shoulder
                  was an old Joe Manton, which had evidently seen service: upon the whole there was
                  a certain something in the air and carriage which caused an uneasy sensation about
                  the keeper's heart. The travelling artist looked like a man who could do mischief;
                  but there was no help for it now, so Sandy Macpherson took his departure,
                  consoling himself with the reflection, that even if the major could, by any
                  possibility, kill a grouse, Sancho was about the last dog in the world likely to
                  facilitate such an operation. He was an old pepper and salt colored pointer, with
                  a remarkably short tail, dull bleared eyes, which looked as if he slept a great
                  deal more than was good for him; he was lame into the bargain; and, upon the
                  whole, as unlikely looking an animal to be of use, except for "cat's meat," as any
                  the major had ever seen. But he was not the man to be deterred by difficulties; so
                  having pulled out a handful of bright new shillings, brought with him for the purpose, he showed them to the young
                  Celt at his side, and promising to reward him richly for every pack of grouse to
                  which he introduced him, Major O'Shaughnessy trudged cheerfully on, resolving that
                  if whipcord could enlighten Sancho as to the responsibilities of his situation, he
                  should have it in abundance.
               A smart walk of a couple of miles brought the party to a beautiful range of quiet
                  hills, whose sides were covered nearly half way up with heather-green—pasture land
                  lay along the top—no trace of human habitation, save an old dismantled sheep-fold,
                  was in sight, and the occasional tinkling of a sheep bell in the distance, was the
                  only sound that broke the silence. Far as the eye could reach lay a wide expanse
                  of heather, the tops and brooms of which waved to and fro in a fresh westerly
                  breeze, affording abundant promise that the task of finding birds would be one of
                  easy performance.
               "Here be the ground, sir, that maister always brings the quality folks to; there's
                  a sight o' grouse along them hills," the red-legged boy said.
               "Very well, then, Dick, you may let the old dog go."
               Away accordingly scampered Sancho, evidently in a state of high excitement, his
                  stump of a tail wriggling to and fro, and his whole deportment affording abundant
                  proof that he knew perfectly well where he was. In his more juvenile days, he had
                  upon the same stage probably acquitted himself with credit; but to do anything
                  with credit, except eat, drink, and bite beggars, was an exploit with which Sancho
                  had long ceased to be familiar; so on he went, poking and snuffing among the
                  heather, until he sprang a fine pack of grouse, and then his conduct was
                  indecorous in the extreme; for not content with nearly capturing the old cock, he
                  began to bark like a terrier, and chased each bird in succession as it rose from
                  the heather, with an agility which could scarcely have been expected in a dog of
                  his years.
               "Ho! I'll cure you of that presently, my boy," the major said, as he knocked over
                  a brace of birds, right and left.
               Sancho, by the aid of the young Celt, was soon caught, and a flagellation
                  inflicted which astonished him, as well as some sheep grazing in the distance,
                  whom the howls of the unlucky culprit sent scampering off across the hills.
               The dog, released, rolled himself on the heather, and trotted off gay as a lark,
                  as if his faculties had been refreshed by the discipline he had undergone.
               "By Jove, he's on birds again!" said the major.
               "Deed, an he just is; ye had best keep close up to him," whispered the boy.
               "Have a care there!" roared the major, whose mouth the words had hardly escaped,
                  when up got another pack. Bang! bang! right into the middle of them went both
                  barrels, and a shower of feathers descended upon Sancho, who behaved, if possible,
                  worse than before, for seizing upon one of the fallen birds, he proceeded very
                  deliberately to tear it to pieces.
               "Catch him, Dick! get hold of the bird, or the brute will eat it, feathers and
                  all!"
               Sancho was caught, this time not without difficulty, and a second flogging
                  liberally administered, which seemed to recall the dog to some of his senses, for
                  he went on rather more cautiously than before, no great way, indeed, before it was
                  evident there was something more in the wind, for after a short time he came to a
                  very tolerable point. Up got a fine hare; off went Sancho, the major's gun just
                  touched his shoulder and over went pussy, crunkling out a full length in the
                  heather. At the same moment, started by the noise, another pack of grouse rose,
                  into which the contents of the major's
                  second barrel went with fell precision.
               "Now, Dick! be alive, pick up the birds, look sharp; at this rate you'll be rich
                  before night," said the major, reloading as quickly as he could.
               The place was literally alive with game. The coolness and precision of the
                  sportsman made amends for the obstinate perversity of the dog. The major's blood
                  was up, he scarcely missed a shot, and the red-legged boy was staggering with the
                  weight he carried, long before the day was over. Alas! could the deceived and
                  deeply injured Sandy Macpherson have only known what devastation was going on
                  among his grouse he could scarcely have been so hard upon the grazier, with whom
                  he was chaffering about the price of a heifer; nor, his bargain being concluded,
                  would he have jogged home with that cheerful expression his countenance wore when
                  he alighted from his shelty, towards nightfall, at the door of the Cat and
                  Bagpipes.
               "Ha'e ye the ten pun' ready for me?" he inquired, with a pleasant smile, as he
                  opened the door of the parlor, where the major was seated at dinner.
               "No, Sandy, but you have brought it from the fair for me, I hope," replied the
                  major, laughing.
               "Na, na, de'il a bit, that winna do; ye couldna shoot a grouse if yer life
                  depended on it—ye ha'e nae nerves."
               "Take a chair, Sandy, you must stay to dinner; but before you sit down just lift
                  that cloth, on the side-board; you'll see something there that'll give you an
                  appetite for the mutton."
               The poor keeper did as he was bid, and a sight was indeed revealed to his
                  astonished gaze which for many a long day he bitterly remembered. There, ranged in
                  due order, were about forty brace of the duke's finest grouse, not to mention
                  several hares, and sundry head of black game. Confusion, horror, surprise, and
                  wrath struggled for a moment in his countenance, and seemed to deprive him of all
                  power of utterance.
               "Hech, sirs! I'm a ruined man, that's all," he said at last, with an execration we
                  need not stay to mention.
               "Deuce a bit, Sandy; keep your own counsel, and I'll keep mine, you may be certain
                  of that."
               "An' with that auld dowg, that I thocht didna ken a grouse frae a gander. An' my
                  ten pun' into the bargain. Oh, Lord! oh, Lord!" groaned the unhappy keeper, wiping
                  the perspiration off his forehead.
               "Never mind that, Sandy, I can afford to let you off the bet; the day's sport is
                  worth the money, and more too," and the major, as he spoke, slipped a few
                  sovereigns into the keeper's hand.
               "Aweel! aweel! wha'd ha'e thocht it, wi' that auld deef pointer. De'il tak' me but
                  if ever I see a chiel on the mountains again wi' a blue body coat an' dancing
                  shoon, I'll slip the dowgs at him, dang me if I don't!"
               "Never mind; Sancho is no great things of a dog, but his master is a right honest
                  fellow, and a staunch sportsman into the bargain. Scotchman as you are, you cannot
                  be expected to be a match for a man who has hunted with the 'Faugh a Ballaghs.'
                  But if ever you come to Ireland, Sandy, you shall be right welcome at Badger
                  Hall."
            
            
               
               A Cock-Fight in the Havana.
               ONE bright morning in the month of December, a few years ago, the Ohio lay
                  swinging to-and-fro, under the guns of the Moro Castle, in the harbor of
                  Havana.
               Rising and falling on the breast of the billow, like a beautiful thing of life,
                  with her tall masts tapering to the sky, her half-clewed sails hanging gracefully
                  in the sun, and her bristling port-holes showing a row of teeth almost as
                  formidable as the castle itself, she was a thing both to be admired and to be
                  feared.
               The beautiful quarter-deck shone like a well-polished table; the brass mountings
                  of "long Tom," a respectable sixty-four pounder, glistened like gold, when
                  contrasted with his black muzzle; and beneath the belaying-pins lay sundry
                  well-tarred ropes, coiled up like snakes preparing for a spring.
               A slight breeze rippled the water, gently wafting to leeward the smoke which
                  issued from the cigars of a few officers, who, dressed in the gay uniform of our
                  navy, sat discussing the merits of the combatants in a certain cock-fight, which
                  was to take place on the island that day, and to which they were to be conveyed in
                  the captain's gig, which had been ordered to be got ready for that purpose. It was
                  a bright Sunday morning, the day generally chosen by the Creoles for their
                  exhibitions of bull-fights, cock-fights, and similar rational amusements, and
                  great anxiety was manifested on this occasion to witness the sport, in consequence
                  of the enormous bets which had been staked by the Spaniards and Creoles upon their
                  favorites, and because it was so arranged that the field was open to competitors
                  of all classes.
               Symptoms of impatience were becoming evident in the countenances of the officers
                  at the non-appearance of the gig, when they observed a knot of sailors congregated
                  around the capstan, and in a few minutes, "Will Glover," the boatswain, a fine
                  specimen of an American sailor, approached them, and touching his cap, requested
                  permission to take them ashore in the yawl instead of the gig.
               The request occasioned some surprise, as it was rather an unusual one, and the
                  captain was upon the point of refusing, when the first lieutenant whispered in his
                  ear:
               "There is a lurking devil in Will's eye, which shows that there is mischief in the
                  wind; so let's see what it is about."
               The quick-witted boatswain, however, had seen the impending refusal, and before it
                  had time to leave the captain's lips, he had told him "that the boys had brought
                  out in the vessel a great fighting-bird, which they wanted to match against the
                  best game-cock on the island, being desirous of proving the superiority of the
                  Americans in chickens, as well as in everything else."
               "Besides," continued he, "these yellow devils win our money all the time with
                  their marked cards and loaded dice, and we are burning to have our revenge."
               "But what kind of a bird have you got there?" said the captain; "you cannot hope to fight one of the
                  half-bred game-cocks which we have at home against the splendid birds which these
                  Creoles devote their whole time to breeding and training, and which are perhaps
                  unequalled in the world."
               "Never mind that, captain," answered Will; "we have a bird here that is known all
                  over the United States, and which has never been whipped yet, although he has had
                  worse enemies to encounter than these bilious-looking Spaniards."
               "Well, I do not know what mischief you are after," replied the captain,
                  good-naturedly; "but if you will give your word on behalf of these men, that you
                  will behave yourselves properly while on shore, and not taste a drop of liquor,
                  you may go."
               Will touched his cap again, and in a minute disappeared down the hatch, while the
                  officers stood wondering at the implicit reliance which he seemed to have in the
                  powers of his bird, yet at the same time confiding fully in the well known
                  shrewdness of the fellow, which they had often seen put to the test.
               The yawl was soon lowered, a dozen sailors sprang into it, and swinging round to
                  the gangway, sat silently waiting for the officers; but a knowing smile might have
                  been seen playing about each man's face, which broke into a cheer, as the sturdy
                  boatswain appeared on the monkey-rail with his precious bird in a sack, and
                  seizing the painter, swung himself lightly into the boat.
               By this time the officers had become as much interested in the proceedings as the
                  men, and as soon as they were seated, demanded to see the contents of the bag.
               But Will assured them that the bird would fight so much better if kept in the dark
                  until the hour of combat, and pleaded so earnestly against taking him out, that
                  they at last yielded the point, and contented themselves with listening to an
                  interesting but entirely fabulous history of "The Unknown," which the boatswain
                  related with a seriousness that would have done credit to a funeral sermon.
               As they approached the shore, he concluded by saying:
               "I have good reason for wishing to preserve my bird's secret until the last
                  moment, and although you will discover it the moment it is pitted, I hope your
                  honors will keep your thoughts to yourselves, and not betray us. We have raised
                  all the money we could on the ship, and have got a good purse to put against the
                  best cock that ever crowed in the Havana, and if your honors would like to do a
                  little betting, you can do it with perfect safety on this bird, or my name's not
                  Will Glover; for their picayune chickens will stand no more chance with him than
                  one of these fellows themselves would with me, and I never saw any three of them
                  yet that I couldn't whip in a free fight."
               Having finished this modest assertion, his eye glanced slightly at his powerful
                  frame, as if to say, "judge for yourselves;" and indeed it required little
                  judgment to perceive that if the bird resembled his master, he would prove a
                  formidable antagonist; for Will's clear blue eye, broad forehead, and bright,
                  handsome countenance gave promise of more than ordinary intelligence and
                  resolution, while his thick, brawny neck and huge arms looked perfectly capable of
                  performing in a "free fight," even more than had just been claimed for them.
               In a few minutes, the party had landed and separated, the officers having gone to
                  a livery-stable to procure a conveyance, and the stalwart form of the boatswain
                  could be seen rolling up the street, at the head of a body of men, whose
                  appearance was such as to render them little likely to receive interruption from
                  the majority of peaceably-disposed citizens.
               
               In about half an hour, they had reached the inclosure which contained the pit, and
                  they soon found themselves in the midst of a motley assemblage, who were
                  chattering and yelling in a manner worthy of the gallery of a third-rate theatre
                  in the United States.
               Women of every shade of color, from ebony to dirty white, were seated around the
                  outer side of the wall, with tables or trays displaying oranges, bananas,
                  sugar-cane, alligator-pears, mangoes, bell-apples, sapadilloes, and various other
                  tropical fruits, while men and boys were seen parading about with every variety of
                  that officious bird which always insists upon announcing the break of day, when
                  nobody cares about hearing it.
               The pit was surrounded by a large amphitheatre, capable of holding an immense
                  number of persons, and there, seated upon benches, raised one above the other, sat
                  the beauty and chivalry of the Havana. There 
                     
                        "Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
                        And all went merry as a marriage-bell!"
                     
                   but nevertheless old and young, rich and poor, seemed bent upon enjoying the
                  sport, and the "soft eyes" above alluded to seemed quite willing to divide their
                  favors equally between their cavaliers and the chickens.
               Whenever a fine bird was exhibited and matched against another, the ladies were
                  seen betting with as much vivacity as the men, although their stakes were more
                  moderate than the immense sums which some of the old Dons displayed upon little
                  tables around the edge of the ring, and which they won and lost with a nonchalance worthy of a better cause.
               Glover and his companions, on entering the amphitheatre, took their seats near the
                  door, and shortly after the officers of the Ohio arrived, and obtaining places a
                  short distance from the men, were soon engaged in making trifling bets with those
                  around them, on such birds as happened to excite their admiration.
               Gallant birds they certainly were, and worthy of all admiration; but unless
                  history is to be disbelieved, they were guilty of most extraordinary
                  anachronisms.
               Time, place, and facts were utterly disregarded in the scenes there enacted, and
                  the very dead were brought from their graves to fight for the amusement of the
                  inconsiderate spectators.
               Julius Cæsar was there picking a quarrel with the Duke of Wellington; Plutarch was
                  strutting about with a large red comb in his head; Lord Byron, with bare legs and
                  steel-spurs, was seen running away from Christopher Columbus; and Mark Antony was
                  heard pronouncing an extremely tautological oration over the dead body of Don
                  Quixote.
               It is true that the eloquence of this Mr. Antony was not quite equal to that of
                  another of the same name, who once began an address by making the unreasonable
                  request that his "friends," as well as the "Romans and countrymen," would "lend
                  him their ears;" but his style was certainly more terse and laconic, for his
                  preface consisted of "cock-a," his story of "doodle," and the conclusion of "doo."
                  Such brevity should certainly have ranked with the "veni, vidi, vici" of olden
                  times, and the "Sebastopol est pris" of our day.
                  But to return to our unfortunate bird, who had been covered all this time with
                  sack-cloth, if not with ashes, and who had been kept entirely in the dark with
                  regard to these proceedings. Various contests had taken place, many a gallant bird
                  had fallen a victim to his bravery, and the interest of the audience was beginning
                  to flag, when a Creole stepped into the ring, and offered to match a splendid
                     bird which he held under his arm,
                  against anything that had wings, on the island.
               No one answered, as the bird was the most celebrated one in the Havana, and the
                  owner's efforts to find an antagonist seemed likely to prove futile.
               Signor Amigo's black game-cock, "Satan," was known to every one in the town as
                  having whipped the best birds the island had produced, and being still in his
                  prime, no one cared about losing a fine bird by matching him against this "Cœur de
                  Lion" of roosters. Incensed with the idea of winning neither money nor renown with
                  his favorite bird, he at last offered to stake a hundred doubloons against fifty,
                  and no one accepting his challenge, he was preparing to leave the ring, when our
                  boatswain sprang up, and in very bad Spanish, a smattering of which he had
                  acquired in his wanderings, asked him if he was willing to match him against a
                  curious-looking bird which he had with him in a bag.
               "Against anything that has wings is my challenge," proudly replied Amigo; "produce
                  your bird, sir."
               Without further parley, Will untied the bag, and produced, to the astonishment of
                  the officers and the rest of the assembly, the most curious-looking specimen of
                  the feathered tribe that had ever graced or disgraced a cock-pit.
               It was a bird about the size of a large rooster, with no tail, no comb, and no
                  steel gaffles. Comb it seems he never had had, and as for tail, if he had ever
                  been blessed with such an appendage, the ruthless sailors must have "clipped it
                  short and driven it in," for not a vestige of it remained; and to add to the
                  disfigurement, he was smeared with a mixture of grease and blacking, until his
                  original color had been entirely lost. A loud shout of derision arose from the
                  spectators at the impudence of the Yankees, in offering so miserable a creature as
                  the antagonist of "Satan," the pride of the Havana, and as they doubtless thought,
                  the hero of a Hemisphere.
               But to the experienced eyes of the officers of the Ohio, the secret was now
                  revealed, and beneath the grease and soot, in spite of the clipped wings and
                  chipped feathers, they perceived the eye of an old bald eagle, and the terrible
                  beak and claws, which the sailors had almost managed to conceal by covering them
                  with feathers, taken from the chickens of some by-gone dinner.
               The officers now regretted that they had permitted the men to come ashore, as they
                  were fearful that the artifice, if discovered, might lead to blows; and the
                  determined character of the men rendered them very dangerous when excited.
               Matters, however, had now proceeded too far to be stopped, and they had to content
                  themselves with relying on the prudence of Glover. Although they knew that he was
                  a perfect devil when his blood was up, they still knew him to be a man of his
                  word, and that he would not make a disturbance if he could help it; so hoping that
                  their presence would have its influence with the audience, they drew still closer
                  to the boatswain, and then quietly awaited the issue. But their fears were
                  unnecessary; the sailors had no intention of getting into a fight, and as their
                  chief object was to make up their losses by winning a pile of gold from the
                  Habaneros, they quietly staked all the money they had among those around them,
                  generally contriving to get heavy odds in their favor. Besides the money which the
                  men had brought with them, Glover had collected on the ship about thirty
                  doubloons, twenty-five of which he staked against the fifty of the Signor's, who
                  had graciously condescended to reduce the amount of the bet one-half, in
                  consideration of the poverty of "Los
                  Americanos," and the other
                  five he had managed to place advantageously, at the rate of about one to three,
                  among the audience, all of whom seemed anxious to have an opportunity of "turning
                  an honest penny," by fleecing the ignorant Yankees.
               Even the officers themselves at last caught the infection. Unable to resist the
                  pressing offers of those around them, knowing the power of their champion, and
                  feeling a gallant pride in sustaining the character of their national bird, they
                  bet the last dollar they had with them, until the amount staked by officers and
                  men exceeded a hundred doubloons, and the odds given by the Cubans had amounted to
                  nearly three times this sum.
               Before proceeding further, it was arranged that the birds were to be placed in the
                  ring, and then both the Signor and Will were to retire, while the actual death of
                  a bird was alone to decide the victory.
               The birds were accordingly set down a few feet from each other, and amid the
                  acclamations of the Habaneros, the instant that "Satan" touched the ground, he
                  threw himself into an imposing attitude, and uttered a crow of defiance, which
                  rang through the building, and was immediately answered by a dozen of his
                  neighbors outside the walls. Black as a raven's wing, a more beautiful bird had
                  never delighted the eyes of the Cubans. He wore on his neck a natural ruff, which
                  looked like that once worn by Mary, Queen of Scots, while his blood-red comb
                  looked still redder when contrasted with the jet-black hue of the rest of his
                  body. His tail fell gracefully to the ground, and it was very evident to
                  discriminating spectators that he would never "show the white feather," because he
                  did not happen to possess any of that description.
               "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" was all that he said, and then looking round to see who he
                  could pick a fight with, he espied the American bird cuddled up in a heap, as if
                  very much annoyed at the embarrassing position in which he found himself
                  placed.
               But if astonishment was ever depicted on the brow of a chicken, it certainly was
                  depicted upon "Satan's" at this moment. More than once he extended his long neck,
                  as if to obtain a nearer view, and convince himself that he was not deceived, and
                  then puffed out his breast, as if he considered it morally impossible that he, the
                  descendant perhaps of a race that had crowed over Granada with Alhamar, or who
                  possibly had even displayed their valor before Euric and his Goths, could be
                  pitted against such a dirty specimen of the "canaille" as now stood before him.
                  Had there been an aperture in the wall of the ring sufficiently large to have
                  enabled him to stalk majestically away, it is probable that this scion of Granada
                  would have declined the contest, in the same manner that we might suppose the
                  "Chevalier Bayard" would have declined to sully his reputation by an encounter
                  with a common prize-fighter; but there was no chance of escape, and conscious that
                  both the nobility and democracy of Havana were awaiting his movements, he
                  concluded to kill his antagonist at once, and extricate himself from the
                  unpleasant predicament. He could not shout "a Bayard!" or "a Satan to the rescue!"
                  for his voice was only adapted to saying that eternal "cock-a-doodle-doo," and he
                  had no lance to couch; so instead, he lowered his head and tail to a level, in
                  imitation of one, and then precipitated himself with unerring precision on his
                  adversary, making the feathers fly, as he struck him a savage blow with his sharp
                  steel gaffs.
               Had Mr. Pickwick heard an insinuation against his courage; had a Yankee peddler
                  been discovered in the act of selling honest nutmegs; had Macdonald surrendered at
                  Wagram without a blow; had Napoleon's "Old Guard" deserted him at Waterloo; or had
                  "Old Hickory" been seen scampering away
                  at New-Orleans; had anything in fact utterly impossible happened to anybody,
                  anybody could not have been more completely thunder-struck than was our
                  dilapidated old eagle at the impudence of this vicious chicken.
               The few battles that the eagle had heretofore indulged in had always been
                  conducted on the wing, and consisted merely in his pitching into somebody with a
                  kind of flying artillery, so that he was about as much used to this kind of
                  fighting as one of our city-brigade inspectors would be if he found himself
                  dodging Camanche rifle-balls in a Mexican swamp. It would be natural to suppose
                  that "his eagle eye now lighted up," and that the rash chicken would instantly
                  have paid the penalty of his folly, but he did not do anything of the kind.
               As the cock struck him, he slightly elevated his wings, as elderly gentlemen
                  elevate their eye-brows when they hear of the mad freaks of younger members of the
                  family, ducked his head like a goose entering a barn-door, twisted his neck into a
                  most uncomfortable position, to take a bird's eye view of the matter, and then
                  calmly walking away from the irascible individual who had insulted him, drew
                  himself into as spherical a position as possible, and waited to see what would
                  happen next.
               His curiosity upon this point, however, was destined to be very soon gratified,
                  for "Satan," having once tasted blood, waived all difference of rank, and flew at
                  him again like a fury.
               Three times did the eagle receive these unwarrantable assaults without giving way
                  to his temper, and although his feathers were flying about and the blood trickling
                  down his breast, he still seemed indisposed to fight. Every time that "Satan"
                  struck him, a yell of delight broke from the Cubans, and to them the fate of the
                  nondescript seemed inevitable; but Glover and his companions maintained an
                  imperturbable silence, their only fear being that an unlucky blow of the spurs
                  might reach a vital part before the eagle had awakened to a sense of his
                  danger.
               But the time had now arrived when America was to assert her majesty, and the
                  Habaneros were to learn the danger of trifling with her eagle.
               The last blow the gallant cock was ever to strike had been struck, and as the
                  blood spurted from a deep wound made by the gaffs, the eagle, raising himself to
                  his grandest height, extended a claw, and seizing the brave but doomed bird by the
                  back, pinned him to the earth as if he had been nailed there.
               For an instant he gazed upon his fallen enemy— 
                     
                        "With that stern pride which warriors feel
                        In foemen worthy of their steel,"
                     
                   and then—I blush to tell it—with his other claw, deliberately pulled
                     his head off!
               
               Do not smile, reader; it is a very serious thing to have one's head pulled off,
                  even if one is a chicken; and when we take into consideration what a chivalrous
                  chicken this was, that was so unceremoniously decapitated, and how contrary such a
                  proceeding was to the usual courtesies of the cock-pit, the subject becomes a
                  grave one. Such a foul innovation upon the rules of propriety was heretofore
                  unknown among chickens; and although it is true that "Satan" had only received
                  what he had so often dealt out to others—death—yet he had always killed his
                  adversaries in a high-bred, chicken-like manner, and had never conceived the
                  horrible idea of pinning his enemy to the ground, and then pulling his head out of
                  its socket, as a dentist would pull a tooth.
               O Cruikshank! why were you not in that vicinity then? Why has not that picture been faithfully portrayed
                  by your truthful but sarcastic pencil?
               Collins might have written another ode on the passions there displayed, or John
                  Bunyan filled another "Pilgrim's Progress" with personifications from that scene.
                  Death was there in the form of a headless chicken; victory in the shape of a burly
                  boatswain: malice in the sinister looks of the enraged Creoles; while dismay,
                  chagrin, and vexation were faithfully represented by the discomfited Signor, as he
                  stood with the body of the deceased in one hand and the head in the other, looking
                  "first upon this picture and then upon that." But besides these beautiful
                  images—to the disgrace of the waggish sailors—there was a sad transposition of an
                  emblem that they were bound by every tie of duty to have preserved intact.
               A modern poem, which has been made trite by its beauty, tells us that once upon a
                  time Freedom 
                     
                        "From his mansion in the sun
                        Had called her eagle-bearer down,
                        And given to his mighty hand
                        The symbol of her chosen land:"
                     
                   and yet, without the slightest regard for all this, the said eagle had been
                  tarred and feathered until "the majestic monarch of the cloud" had been converted
                  into a creature which, instead of soaring to heaven as the presager of liberty,
                  was running about a cock-pit, looking very much like an old school-girl in
                  pantalettes with wide ruffles, or even more like one of those strong-minded
                  females who pass their declining years in asserting "women's rights" and "higher
                  laws," and who generally become "Bloomers" about the time they cease to bloom.
                  Nevertheless, the girlish attire and innocent unconsciousness of the old eagle
                  were not sufficient to appease the wrath of the backers of "Satan;" and if they
                  had been fallen angels themselves, they could not have looked more ready to avenge
                  the death of his Satanic Majesty than they did to avenge the death of his
                  namesake.
               The cry of "unfair, unfair!" arose from all sides, and symptoms of a row were
                  quite prevalent, when Glover sprang into the ring, and snatching up his bird,
                  roared out with a voice of thunder, "that his comrades were willing to abide by
                  the decision of the judge, and that they wanted nothing but what was right,"
                  adding, however, parenthetically and "sotto
                  voce," that "if the judge did not know what right was, he would probably
                  receive some instruction upon the subject before they left."
               Fortunately, for the sake of peace, the matter was too plain a one to admit of
                  much dispute. "Satan" had been fairly pitted against the nondescript, and if the
                  nondescript preferred pulling his head off, to the more laborious method of
                  killing him by spurring and pecking at him, he had a perfect right to do so.
               Whether the judge had overheard the conclusion of Will's remarks; whether he had
                  perceived a curious fat-looking pistol, with six holes in it, which the fellow had
                  contrived to leave sticking out of his pocket; and whether either had any
                  influence in bringing his mind to a just decision, are points which, like many
                  other gentlemen on the bench, he reserved to himself; but his decision was
                  certainly given promptly in favor of the American bird, and both officers and men
                  immediately received from the stakeholders the full amount of the bets. Still, not
                  withstanding the favorable decision of the ermine, Cuba had now become to the
                  sailors what England became to the regicides of the seventeenth century—quite a
                  warm place of residence, or, to speak more plainly, "too hot to hold them."
               The regicides had beheaded a king of England, and they had only beheaded a king of the cock-pit; but the
                  Cubans were as likely to avenge the one as the Stuarts had been to avenge the
                  other, and therefore, like the man who was pitched out of a second-story window,
                  they "concluded that it was time to leave."
               Not that the tars were really pitched out, however; for although pitch and tar are
                  almost synonymous terms, yet there is a kind of American tar which does not get
                  often pitched about by anybody except old "Poseidon," the chap that carries a
                  trident—an article, by the way, that reminds us either of a cow-stable or our
                  grandmother's toasting-fork. And to this class our sailors belonged.
               Had a due sense of propriety governed their actions, it is probable that we should
                  have now seen them 
                     
                        "Fold their tents like the Arabs,
                        And as silently steal away;"
                     
                   but they had kept quiet a marvellously long time for sailors; so waving their
                  hats above their heads, they gave three tremendous cheers, which fairly shook the
                  building, and then forming in line, marched out, straight through a crowd of men,
                  who had collected at the door, as if for the purpose of impeding their exit, but
                  who, when they found themselves in actual contact with the sturdy tars, concluded
                  to let them strike a "bee line" in any direction they preferred.
               The officers soon followed the men, and in a few minutes the yawl was bounding
                  over the water, flying back to the ship like a gull to its nest.
               Many a bottle was cracked to the health of the American bird in the cabin of the
                  Ohio that night, and it is supposed that "brandy-smashes" to a considerable
                  amount, to say nothing of "gin cock-tails," were consumed in the forecastle at the
                  same time, for the laudable purpose of assisting the sailors to sing the praises
                  of their champion. History, with culpable negligence, has not transmitted to us
                  the future fate of the bird; but if sailors ever die solvent, which is doubtful,
                  or if they ever make wills, which is more so, depend upon it that as "Vogelweide,
                  the Minnesinger," once did for the birds of Würtzburg's towers, they will leave a
                  considerable sum to be invested in government securities for the maintenance of
                  that gallant old eagle.
            
            
               
               Angelica Staggers.
               BY AN OLD BACHELOR.
               I'M not a sentimental man now. I have passed that state of existence long since,
                  as a man whose whiskers have got bushy, while the hair on his crown has got thin,
                  and whose eyes are surrounded by little nascent crows' feet, decidedly ought to
                  have done. I confess that I prefer a good dinner to the most enchanting of balls,
                  claret to polkas, and a jolly bacchanalian ditty to the pretty small talk of the
                  most dainty damsel that ever floated through a quadrille in ringlets and clear
                  muslin.
               "Horrid wretch!" I hear some lady reader exclaim, as she peruses this confession,
                  and prepares to throw down the book in disgust. Stay one moment, fair lady, I
                  beseech you, and you shall have a little genuine sentimental reminiscence of my
                  "days of auld lang syne"—and then—then you may throw down the book if you please,
                  and call me a "horrid wretch" if you can.
               
               What a pretty, little, gauzy, fairy-like creature was Angelica Staggers, when
                  first I met her? The very recollection of her at this moment makes a faint
                  vibration of my heart perceptible to me, while then the sound of her
                  name would startle me like the postman's rap at the street door. Bill Staggers (it
                  isn't a pretty name, Staggers—but then, Angelica!) was a schoolfellow of mine.
                  Schoolboys don't talk much about their sisters, because they get laughed at if
                  they do: so that I knew little more than the bare fact that Staggers
                     had a sister. In after years when we left school, and Staggers
                  went into his father's counting-house in the city, and I into my father's office
                  in Gray's Inn, the matter was different.
               Staggers introduced me to his family. This consisted of his papa, a pompous old
                  fellow who always wore a dress coat in the street as well as at home, and whose
                  pendant watch-seals would certainly have drawn him under water, if he had ever had
                  the misfortune to tumble overboard from a Margate steamer; of mamma, who was a
                  lady of vast dimensions, with the usual superfluity of color in her cheeks and cap
                  ribbons on her head; of a sister of Mr. Staggers, senior, who might have been
                  agreeable if she had not given you the idea of being pinched everywhere—pinched in
                  her waist, pinched in her nose, pinched in her mouth, and pinched in her views of
                  things in general; and, lastly, of the daughter of the house—the divine Angelica
                  herself.
               How shall I describe Angelica as I first saw her one fine summer's day, about two
                  o'clock in the afternoon, dressed in the most charming of muslin negligée dresses, reclining in a large easy-chair, and
                  embroidering on a frame a pair of worsted slippers for her papa? How shall I ever
                  give an accurate picture of her beautiful, light, golden hair, that literally
                  glittered in the rays of the sunshine, that made their way through the half-drawn
                  green venetian blinds of the window by which she sat, in the drawing-room of that
                  delightful villa at Peckham, that looked out on to the smoothly shaven lawn, with
                  the large washing basin of a fish-pond on it, containing ever so many shillings'
                  worth of gold and silver fish? I can't
                  do it. I have let all my poetry run to seed, and I feel myself as incompetent to
                  do justice to the charms of Angelica as a sign-painter would be to copy a Madonna
                  of Raphael, or a street ballad screamer to sing the "stabat mater" of Rossini. I
                  must give up the attempt: but cannot the reader help me out of the difficulty, by
                  imagining something very fair, pink and white, very slight, very animated, and
                  very ethereal-looking altogether? Of course he can;—then there is Angelica
                  Staggers before his eyes directly.
               From the moment I saw her I felt that my doom was fixed, and my heart
                     trans-fixed. I admired, I loved, I adored her, and the very
                  atmosphere that surrounded her (I don't mean the smell of roast duck that was
                  steaming up from the kitchen) seemed to breathe of paradise. Accordingly, as a
                  very natural consequence of this feeling of mine, I behaved very
                  sheepishly—blushed and stammered, and tore off the buttons of my gloves, stuck my
                  legs into absurd positions from not knowing what the deuce to do with them,
                  stumbled over an ottoman as I took my leave, and to save my own fall caught at a
                  china card-tray and smashed it—effecting my retreat at length in a state of tremor
                  sufficient to have brought on a nervous fever.
               My friend Staggers quizzed me:—
               "Why, Jones, I never saw you so quiet. I always thought you such a devil of a
                  fellow among the ladies. You've lost your tongue to-day: what is it?"
               What is it! As if I were going to tell him what it was. Supposing I
                  had told him that his sister was an angel, the fellow would have grinned and
                  thought I was mad. Men never do believe in the divinity of their sisters; they are
                  almost as incredulous as husbands touching their wives. The last man in the world
                  I would select as the confidant of my love affairs would be the brother of my
                  adored one.
               I should know that he would annoy me by the most anti-romantic anecdotes of his
                  sister's childhood, and tease her to death by frightful stories of myself. And so
                  I invented excuses about being "out of sorts," and that sort of thing, to account
                  for my unwonted taciturnity and embarrassment at this my first interview with
                  Angelica Staggers.
               I was soon a very frequent visitor at the Peckham Villa, and I had reason to
                  suppose that I was a welcome one. The old gentleman was very civil; mamma was
                  pressing in her invitations; the "maiden aunt" affable in the extreme; and
                  Angelica always received me with a smile, that I valued at a higher price than
                  California and Australia together could pay.
               The Staggers family led a quiet life, with the exception of Bill, who haunted
                  theatres and cider cellars, and harmonic meetings, and passed as disreputable an
                  existence as a city clerk well could. I seldom met any one at the Peckham Villa
                  but the family, and occasionally a Signor Fidilini, who was Angelica's music and
                  singing master, and was sometimes invited to tea in the evening, that he might
                  delight Papa Staggers by playing and singing duets with Angelica. I can't say I
                  liked his doing so myself, and I always considered his double-bass growl spoiled
                  the silvery notes of his pupil's voice; and then I had a great objection to seeing
                  his jewelled fingers hopping about and jumping over Angelica's on the piano, in
                  some of those musical firework pieces they played together. But he was a very
                  quiet, gentlemanly fellow, and remarkably respectful in his manner to Angelica, so
                  that there could be no real cause for jealousy—but!—the word seemed quite absurd
                  to use in such a case.
               My father pronounced me the idlest clerk he ever had. I am not sure that he was
                  quite wrong, but he little suspected the cause. While I ought to have been
                     drawing abstracts of title, I was
                  drawing fancy portraits of Angelica; while I should have been drawing
                  brief-sheets, Angelica's form was engrossing my thoughts; instead of studying
                  declarations at law, I was cogitating a declaration of my attachment. To plead
                  well my own cause with herself and her father was the only sort of pleading I
                  cared for; while the answer I might get to my suit was of ten thousand times more
                  consequence in my eyes than all the answers in all the fusty old Chancery-suits in
                  all the lawyers' offices in the world. As for reading, Moore and Byron supplied
                  food to the mind that ought to have been intent on Coke and Blackstone. Apollo,
                  God of Poetry, and Venus, deification of Love, answer truly!—is there a more
                  wretched being, a more completely fish-out-of-water individual than a lawyer's
                  clerk in love?
               After long and painful watching, I became convinced, in spite of a lover's fears,
                  that Angelica was not insensible to my attachment. The little bouquets I bought
                  for her at Covent Garden Market were received with a look that thrilled through my
                  very soul. (I hope that is a proper expression, but my poetry having grown rusty,
                  as I before-mentioned, I am in some doubt about the matter.) There was, or I
                  dreamt it, a gentle pressure of the hand as we met, and as we parted, that could
                     not be accidental, and could not be that of mere
                  friendship. There was a half timidity in the tone of her voice as she addressed
                  me, different from the self-possession she displayed in conversation with others.
                  In short, there were a thousand of those little signs, visible though
                  indescribable, that Angelica Staggers knew that I loved her and was gratified by
                  the fact.
               Now most men would have thrown themselves at her feet and made their vows, in such
                  a case; but I was doubtful whether that was the most safe course to pursue in
                  order to secure the prize. It struck me that her father was just one of those
                  crusty old gentlemen that look on a young fellow as little better than a
                  pickpocket, who dares to gain a daughter's affections without first asking her
                  papa's permission to do so. On the other hand, I was quite aware that young ladies
                  don't like to be asked of their papas before they are asked themselves; there is
                  too much of the Mahometan and Continental style in such a proceeding to please our
                  free-born island lasses. Still, I might get over that difficulty by explaining how
                  hopeless I believed it to be to secure her father's consent at all, unless I got
                  it first. I was right; and so I resolved to have an interview with
                  Mr. Staggers, and explain my sentiments.
               Did any one of my readers ever drive in tandem two horses that had never been
                  broken to harness! Did he ever let off a blunderbuss that had been loaded for ten
                  years? Did he ever walk through long grass notoriously full of venomous snakes?
                  Did he ever ride a broken-kneed horse over stony ground? Did he ever take a cold
                  shower-bath at Christmas? Did he ever propose the health of the ladies in the
                  presence of the ladies themselves, and before he had at all "primed" himself? Did
                  he ever walk across a narrow greasy plank placed across a chasm some hundreds of
                  feet in depth? If he has done all or any of these feats, I can bear witness to the
                  fact that he has had some experience of nervous work; but if he has never been
                  back-parlored with a grave, pompous old father, of whom he is about to ask his
                  daughter's hand, then, I say his experience of real, genuine,
                  "nervous work" is but infantile after all. Making a declaration to the lady
                  herself is nothing to it, though a little embarrassing too; but then you know that
                  the fair one is in as much trepidation as yourself, and not watching you with a
                  cold calculating eye, weighing your expressions, and drawing conclusions perhaps
                  prejudicial to your reputation for sense or honesty. I declare that I would not
                     go through that ordeal again for the
                  wealth of the Antipodes (that's the last new phrase): and, between ourselves, that
                  is the very reason why I remain to this day a———but stop—I am anticipating.
               I cannot give an account of my interview with Old Staggers, because, even half an
                  hour after it was over, I had but a confused recollection of what took place at
                  it. I only know that it haunted my dreams like a nightmare for nights after. I was
                  eternally jumping up in my bed in a cold perspiration, with my hair half thrusting
                  my night-cap off my head, in the midst of "explaining my intentions." However, a
                  great point was gained—Mr. Staggers agreed to offer no opposition to the match,
                  provided my father consented also.
               "I shall call on him to-day, my young friend," he said: "so dine with us at
                  Peckham at six, and you shall know the result. I don't forbid your
                  going there earlier, if you feel inclined to do so."
               This was handsome. I expressed my gratitude as well as I was able, and at once
                  took a Peckham omnibus, and hastened to Angelica.
               "Missus is out, sir; and so's Miss Staggers: but Miss Angelica's in the
                  drawing-room, sir."
               "Very well. I'll go there—you needn't show me up."
               So saying, I sprang lightly upstairs, and was in the drawing-room in an instant. A
                  sudden shriek—a short, quick, half-stifled one—met my ears as I entered, and I saw
                  Signor Fidilini move his arm very hastily, as if it had been in far closer
                  proximity to the waist of Angelica, who was at the piano, than I should have
                  considered at all necessary in an ordinary music lesson.
               "Oh dear, Mr. Jones! how you did startle me," cried Angelica, blushing terribly,
                  as she rose to shake hands with me. "I didn't hear you coming at all, I assure
                  you."
               I didn't need that assurance, and I believe I said something of the sort.
               "Mees Angelica so feared, dat I put out my arm to stop her fall off from the
                  stool," said Fidilini; and he looked so perfectly truthful and unembarrassed as he
                  spoke, that my dreadful suspicions began to be allayed.
               "I feel quite nervous at this present moment," said Angelica. "Indeed, Signor, you
                  must not ask me to take any more music lessons to-day."
               Signor Fidilini bowed gracefully his assent, and I cast a delighted
                  look at Angelica; for was she not getting rid of that tiresome music-master for
                     my sake? Fidilini packed up his german-sausage roll of music, and,
                  bidding us good-day, bowed himself out of the room.
               We were alone! We looked uncomfortable, and we felt so—I am sure of it in her case
                  as well as my own.
               "Angelica!" I exclaimed.
               She started, and looked surprised.
               "Angelica, I love you—you know it: but you do not know how deeply and
                     how devotedly," &c. &c. I suppose it is quite unnecessary
                  for me to give the remainder of the declaration, because no one can be ignorant of
                  the usual form of the words in these cases. It is as "stereotyped" as an Admiralty
                  Secretary's letters—but I suppose it means a little more, or what a deal of
                  fibbing lovers must be guilty of when they come to the grand scene of the domestic
                  drama of "love!"
               Angelica hung her head, and blushed, and panted. I felt she was mine, and I seized
                  her hand and began to cover it with kisses, when she snatched it from me in such
                  haste, that her diamond and pearl ring scratched my finger, I was amazed!
               "Mr. Jones, I can listen no more. I assure you I must listen no
                  more."
               
               "Why so? Your father will not oppose my wishes, for—"
               "It is not that, sir: it is that I cannot reciprocate the attachment
                  you profess for me."
               "Oh! do not say so—do not—"
               "If you have any generosity in your heart, Mr. Jones, you will cease this strain
                  at once. You have mistaken my feelings altogether."
               "It's that cursed Fidilini!" I cried in a rage, forgetting my good breeding.
               "I beg, sir, that you will not use such language in my presence, especially with
                  reference to a gentleman for whom I entertain a feeling of—"
               "Love," I said, with a stupidly indignant laugh, and an attempt at an air of
                  tragedy. "But I care not. I will shoot him within twenty-four hours, or he shall
                  shoot me;" and I started to my feet with a thorough determination to call out
                  Fidilini without an hour's delay.
               "For heaven's sake, don't speak so," cried Angelica. "There will be murder; I know
                  he'll fight, and you might kill—"
               "Thank you; I might kill him—yes: you don't seem to have any fears
                  lest he should kill me. However, he shall have a chance," and I
                  strode towards the door.
               "Stay," cried Angelica: and she seized my arm: "stay, you shall have my secret,
                  and then I throw myself on your generosity. He is my
                     husband!"
               "Fidilini?—the devil!" I exclaimed.
               "We are privately married," said Angelica, "but for the present do not let—"
               Here we were interrupted by the arrival of Mrs. and Miss Staggers, who entered the
                  room, to our great discomfiture. Angelica, with an appealing look towards me,
                  hurriedly left the room.
               If ever a poor wretch felt himself in an uncomfortable position, I did at that
                  moment, and during the rest of that evening. Mr. Staggers brought home a city
                  friend with him, obviously to avoid a tête-à-tête with me after dinner, but he took care to inform me, in
                  a whisper, that his negotiations with my father had failed. I dare say he was very
                  much surprised at the cool indifference with which I received this piece of
                  information, for he little knew how worthless were the consents of the papas in
                  the present instance.
               Of all the artful little hussies that ever lived, decidedly that girl is the most
                  complete! thought I, as I watched the quiet and composed manner in which Angelica
                  behaved during dinner, and the evening which followed. She played and sang as
                  freely as ever, and even expressed her sorrow that Signor Fidilini was not
                  present, that she might sing one of her papa's favorite duets. If he had
                     been present, I believe I should have strangled the fellow against all
                  resistance.
               How I passed that night, I wont say, but I did not sleep.
               Next morning I was at the office as usual, and really trying to work hard to keep
                  my thoughts from dwelling on Angelica. About ten o'clock my father rushed into the
                  room where I was seated at the desk, in company with Mr. Staggers.
               "Villain!" cried Staggers, to me.
               "You young scoundrel!" screamed my father.
               I was really alarmed, for I thought that both those respectable elderly gentlemen
                  must have gone mad. I stared, in open-mouthed astonishment.
               "Where's my daughter?" bawled Staggers.
               "Answer, sir!" shouted my father, as I looked, if possible, still more
                  surprised.
               "I don't know," I replied.
               "You lie, sir," cried Staggers.
               
               "You are quibbling, sir," added my father; "we don't ask where she is at this very
                  moment; you know what we mean."
               "Is she married?" said Staggers: "answer that."
               "Really, I—"
               "Answer plainly, sir, and without shuffling," cried my father.
               "I believe she is," I answered.
               "Believe! why, you young villain, when you know whether you have
                  married her or not, how dare you talk about what you believe?"
               "I marry her! I'm not married to her!" I cried, in
                  surprise.
               "What the——does all this mean?" exclaimed my father, losing all patience. "Miss
                  Staggers has run off from her father's house—with you, it's
                  suspected."
               "Indeed!" I exclaimed, interrupting him; "then I suppose I may tell the truth; no
                  doubt she has gone with her husband, Fidilini."
               Never shall I forget old Staggers' rage and surprise when he heard my simple
                  story; nor his savage indignation when my father (thinking only of his own son
                  being out of a mess) exclaimed:—
               "I'm deuced glad of it."
               
               I am going to the christening of Madame Fidilini's seventh child to-morrow. They
                  like an old bachelor for a godfather sometimes because he has no other children
                  than god-children to provide for. Grandpapa Staggers will be there, and so will
                  grandmamma and grand-aunt; and the latter will be very attentive to me, but she's
                  more pinched than ever, and looks like a dried herring in figure and complexion. I
                  shall dine with old Staggers afterwards, and he has some superb claret, much
                  better stuff than—well, never mind, I have done!
            
            
               The Fall of the Janissaries.
               "WHO is this that cheapens pistols, when he rather needs a coat of mail?"
               On hearing these words, pronounced in a low, significant tone, the handsome young
                  soldier turned quickly, and beheld near him two female figures shrouded in
                  dark-blue mantles, and long yashmaks, or veils of white muslin. One of them,
                  however, chanced to be in the very act of adjusting her veil, and thus allowed the
                  yuzbashi, or captain—for such his scarlet pelisse, and the golden star embroidered
                  on his jacket, bespoke him—to catch a glimpse of a youthful face of ravishing
                  beauty. The eyes were fixed on the ground, and a deep blush suffused the rounded
                  cheeks. In another instant the veil was replaced, and the two muffled figures
                  moved on and mingled with the throng, leaving the soldier in a state of extreme
                  astonishment and perplexity.
               The principal bazaar of Constantinople presented that day, as usual, a scene of
                  great brilliancy and animation. The numerous arcades, with rows of shops on either
                  hand, were crowded by people of all classes and every race of the East. Grave
                  Turks, in flowing robes and turbans of various hues, shuffled slowly along,
                  followed by slaves who carried their
                  masters' purchases; Persian and Arab traders, Bedouin chiefs, Armenian merchants,
                  Greek islanders, Arnauts from Albania, Mangrebihs from Northern Africa,
                  Toorkomans, Khoords, Tartars, and now and then a Frank of some western nation, all
                  added, by their varied costumes, to the picturesque liveliness of the shifting
                  panorama. Women, whose large languishing eyes were alone visible from within the
                  muffled folds of their vestments, flitted incessantly from shop to shop,
                  displaying quite as much fondness as their western sisters for the delightful
                  trouble of bargaining. Rich young Osmanlis, mounted on handsome steeds, with
                  splendid housings of velvet and gold, rode slowly along in the central avenues;
                  and an araba, or carriage, like a huge cage, all lattice-work and gilding,
                  occasionally stopped to allow one or two shrouded figures to issue forth and join
                  the moving throng.
               One customary element of variety, however, was wanting, the absence of which
                  excited no little remark. Very few of the Janissaries—whose crimson pelisses,
                  white turbans, red shawl-girdles, and silver-mounted weapons, usually made a
                  conspicuous appearance, as they swaggered through the crowd—were now to be seen.
                  The cause of their absence was no secret. This was the 14th of June, 1825, a year
                  and a day memorable in the annals of the Ottoman empire. On the previous day the
                  grand-vizier Selim Mehmed Pasha, and the celebrated Aga Pasha Hussein, commander
                  of the forces, had assembled the Janissaries in their great square—called the
                  Etmeidan, or "Place of Meat," because they there received their daily rations of
                  soup—and had announced to them the new regulations to which they would be required
                  thenceforth to submit. These regulations, which affected not merely their
                  organization, but also their pay and perquisites, their dress and their weapons,
                  were all of a nature to be highly distasteful to the members of that lawless and
                  intractable corps. The precautions of the sultan and his ministers, who had
                  previously gained over or put out of the way many of the leading and most
                  dangerous characters, prevented any open expressions of feeling. The Janissaries
                  listened in sullen silence, and retired quietly to their kislas, or barracks, when
                  the ceremony was over. The grand-vizier beheld this apparent submission with great
                  satisfaction, and congratulated his fellow-minister on the easy success of their
                  master's favorite project. But the aga pasha, better acquainted with the character
                  of his old comrades, shook his head and said, "It will not be done without much
                  blood."
               This day, the 14th, was appointed for the first drilling of the new companies
                  which were to be drawn from each orta, or regiment of Janissaries, and placed
                  under Egyptian officers of the army of Mehemet Ali. Those of the corps who were
                  not in the companies were collected either in the Etmeidan, or in their barracks,
                  anxiously discussing the nature and probable effect of the new regulations, and
                  the course to be pursued by the body at the present crisis. Thus it was that very
                  few of them made their appearance that day in the bazaar; and their place was but
                  poorly supplied by the soldiers of the regular troops—the seymeus (infantry),
                  tobjees (artillery), bostanjees (seraglio-guard), and galionjees (marines), who
                  were present in considerable numbers, and in their ungraceful summer uniforms of
                  white cotton jacket and trousers, with the red cloth fez or scull-cap, and
                  leathern belt, made anything but a pleasing appearance in the eyes of the
                  Mussulman beholders. Their officers, however, in their embroidered jackets, and
                  the scarlet mantles which they were allowed to retain, were seen to more
                  advantage. Of this number was the young soldier who has been already mentioned,
                  and who was at once known by his uniform to be a captain of the corps of
                     gunners ners. Nor did those who were
                  familiar with the various races of the East fail to perceive in the tall and
                  well-set figure, the bold military bearing, the keen blue eye, chestnut locks, and
                  classically-moulded head and features, the marks which denoted his Circassian or
                  Georgian blood.
               "Who is this that buys a bridle when he more requires a spur?"
               The voice was the same that had before struck his ear; and on turning, he again
                  beheld the lovely face, over which the yashmak was just falling. This time the
                  large dark eyes were fixed on him for a moment with an expression of timid
                  anxiety. The soldier stood and gazed at the retreating forms with still greater
                  astonishment than before. The women were evidently of the higher class; and the
                  words which had been uttered seemed to imply some knowledge of and interest in
                  him. Yet he had been but four months in Constantinople, and of that time the
                  greater part had been spent in his barracks at Tophana, out of which he had hardly
                  an acquaintance. If it were a mere frolic of two laughter-loving damsels making
                  their sport of the foreign soldier, why did she who partially unveiled her face
                  assume an expression so little akin to mirthfulness? And why did her companion,
                  who he felt assured was the one that had spoken, keep her countenance carefully
                  concealed?
               While pondering upon this mystery, and pretending to be absorbed in the
                  examination of some Farangee shawls, which were displayed upon the stall of an
                  Armenian merchant, he caught sight of two muffled figures, whose approach caused
                  his heart to beat with a kind of instinctive presentiment. This time his hand was
                  slightly touched, and a soft voice murmured beside his ear, "To-night before the
                  mosque of Raghil Pasha." The figures passed slowly on, and the soldier followed at
                  a little distance, until he saw them enter a carriage, which immediately drove
                  away. The young man, however, easily kept it in sight, until it passed out of the
                  gate of the bazaar. Here a number of Jew porters were seated, waiting to offer
                  their services to any one who might seem to require them. Dropping a coin into the
                  hand of one of them, he said, "Tell me, Jew, know you whose carriage it was that
                  just now passed the gate."
               "Truly, effendi," replied the Jew, "I know it well, for it is one often seen in
                  the bazaar. It is the araba of the Chorbajee Osman, of the seventeenth orta."
               "Osman, a chorbajee*
                   of Janissaries," said the soldier to himself, as he drew his mantle about
                  him, and moved slowly away. "I have heard of him as a favorite leader among his
                  comrades, and a violent partisan of the old institutions. But how can I have
                  become known to any in his harem? There is some mystery, and I will not renounce
                  the adventure until I know more. At all events, there can be no harm in spending
                  an hour or two before the mosque of Raghil Pasha."
               
                  *An officer answering nearly to our colonel; the word, however, means
                     literally, "master of rations," or soup distributer.
               
               Thus meditating, the young man was proceeding in the direction of the Etmeidan,
                  when he encountered a brother officer, who was hastening rapidly towards the port.
                  "How, Soujouk Saduk," said the latter, "are you not for Tophana? have you not
                  heard the news?"
               "What! Have the Janissaries risen?"
               "Not yet," replied the other: "but the Etmeidan is all in commotion. An Egyptian
                  officer has struck one of his men in his company, and all the rest have thrown
                  down their arms and torn off their new uniforms. The ortas are assembling; and
                  there will be burning and bloodshed if something is not quickly done to appease
                  them. I am going to inform the tobjee-bashi."†
               
               
                  †Chief or general of the artillery.
               
               
               "I will wait and learn more," returned Saduk, "and will follow you in a few
                  hours."
               With these words he took leave of his companion, and directed his course through
                  the most unfrequented streets leading towards the mosque of Raghil Pasha, which
                  was beyond the barracks of the Janissaries. It was now sunset, and he made a wide
                  circuit, in order to allow the night to close in before he reached the place of
                  rendezvous. The few persons whom he met on his way hurried by with looks
                  expressive of fear and agitation. He could not doubt that some calamitous event
                  was apprehended; and knowing that an outbreak of the Janissaries was almost always
                  preceded or accompanied by extensive conflagrations, he easily understood the
                  anxiety of the citizens.
               On reaching the mosque, he took post in an obscure angle within its shadow, and
                  remained there motionless for two or three hours. At length, just as he was about
                  to quit the spot, with the conviction that he had been the subject of a very
                  annoying practical jest, a veiled female figure hastily approached the mosque,
                  and, after a moment's hesitation, came towards him. Uncovering her face
                  sufficiently to let him perceive that she was an Abyssinian slave, the woman
                  inquired, "Are you the yuzbashi who buys pistols and bridles, as though he were
                  still a rider on the hills of Atteghai?"
               "I am he whom you seek," replied the young man, much surprised at the latter part
                  of the question.
               "Then," continued the negress, "I am sent to bid you follow me to the presence of
                  a daughter of Atteghai."
               Atteghai is the name which the natives of Circassia give to their country. Saduk
                  at once concluded that some female of his nation, the slave or perhaps the wife of
                  the Chorbajee Osman, desired to speak with him, for the purpose of making
                  inquiries respecting the friends whom she had left in her native land. With this
                  idea, and excited by the hope of once more seeing the face of the beautiful young
                  houri whom he had met that morning, he bade the messenger lead on without delay.
                  The negress obeyed, and after a walk of some length, through several narrow
                  by-streets, she stopped before a small postern door. Opening this with a key, she
                  introduced him into a low dark passage, and producing a small lantern from beneath
                  her mantle, directed him to move forward as noiselessly as possible. In this way
                  they passed through several rooms, and at length the slave, drawing aside a
                  curtain, said, "Enter, effendi, for the mistress awaits you."
               Saduk advanced and found himself in a small apartment, furnished in a costly and
                  luxurious style. A divan of crimson velvet encircled three sides of it; on this,
                  and on the Persian carpet, were heaped numerous cushions, covered with red cloth
                  and morocco. The ceiling was painted in fresco; and from the centre hung a lustre
                  of four lights, which illuminated the apartment. A veiled figure was seated at the
                  upper end of the room, and a voice—the same that he had heard in the bazaar—said
                  in Turkish, "Khosk geldin, Cherkess"—("You are
                  welcome, Circassian.")
               Before he could reply, the veil was drawn aside, and the soldier beheld, to his
                  astonishment, what he would have said was the same face that he had seen in the
                  bazaar, but with the addition of fifteen or sixteen years to its age. The features
                  and expression were the same. The eyes were as large, dark, and languishing; but
                  the sparkle of youth was gone. The cheek was as beautiful in its outline, but
                  without the glow and smoothness of early years. Was it possible that his momentary
                  glimpse could have so much deceived him?
               As he stood thus embarrassed, the lady, who seemed rather to enjoy his perplexity, said with a smile,
                  in the Circassian tongue, "Sit, my friend, while I speak a few words on a subject
                  near to my heart. You are a son of Atteghai, of the family of Soujouk, and the
                  tribe of Natukaitsa. This I have heard from those who have made inquiries
                  respecting you."
               "It is true, lady," replied the young man, "however you have learned it."
               "I, too, am a child of Atteghai," continued his hostess, "of the tribe of
                  Shegakeh. Yours is a great tribe, and a noble family, but mine is obscure and
                  poor. Yet perchance you may have known the Dar Khaldeer of Malskoy?"
               "Unhappily," replied the young man, "I know too little of my native land. When I
                  was a boy of fifteen, the Muscov*
                   and Cossacks crossed the Kouban, and ravaged all the neighboring valleys.
                  The Natukaitsa assembled, and drove them back over the river; but my father and my
                  elder brother were killed in the battle, and I was wounded, and taken prisoner.
                  They carried me with them to Tscherkask, where my wound was healed, and afterwards
                  I was sent to the military college to receive the education of a Russian officer,
                  in the expectation that I would do them good service in the war against my own
                  country. Seven years I remained in the college and in the Russian army, and at
                  length I was sent to fight against my brethren of Atteghai. But I laughed at the
                  beards of the Muscov, and escaped, and fled to the army of my own people, and
                  fought among them until our enemies were driven once more from the land. But when
                  I returned home, my heart was heavy, for there were none to welcome me. My mother
                  and my brothers were dead, and our uncles had taken or sold our property; so,
                  rather than make ill-blood and dissension in the family, I said to myself—'I
                  understand the science and the discipline of the Franks: I will go to Stamboul,
                  and offer myself to the sultan, to serve in his new army. Perhaps I may find
                  favor, and rise to honor, as many others of my countrymen have done.' So I came
                  hither four months ago, and presented myself before the padishah; and when he
                  heard my story, and especially that I knew the art of founding cannon, he was
                  greatly pleased, and made me a yuzbashi at once. This is my history, hanoum;*
                   and thus it is that I know so little of my country, and cannot inform you
                  respecting your friends, for which misfortune I am greatly grieved."
               
                  *Muscovites, or Russians proper.
               
               
                  *Lady.
               
               "So be it," said the fair Circassian, with a sigh: "they are under the protection
                  of Allah. If it be their fate to be well and prosperous, they will be so; and if
                  not, who can alter it?" With this philosophic reflection her disappointment seemed
                  to be assuaged, for she proceeded in a different tone: "Tell me, my young friend,
                  did you see my daughter's face in the bazaar when I bade her put aside her
                  yashmak? And did she please you?"
               "Was she your daughter?" asked the young man. "Truly she is a houri—the loveliest
                  of maidens. I have never seen her equal. Happy will be the man who shall possess
                  such a light of his harem!"
               "Can you not guess, my friend," asked the lady with a smile, "what a mother means
                  when she allows her daughter to uncover her face before a man?"
               "Is it for me that you intend this happiness?" asked the youth, at once astonished
                  and delighted. Then, as the thought of his situation occurred to him, he continued
                  in a despondent tone, "But, alas! what can I say to the chorbajee? What shall I
                  offer as the dowry of his daughter? —I,
                  a poor yuzbashi, with nothing but my mantle and my sabre?"
               "You are rich in the favor of the sultan," replied the lady. "Think you not that
                  all these matters are known in the harems of Stamboul as well as in your barracks
                  at Tophana? You have the knowledge of Frank arts of war, which the sultan prizes
                  above everything else. In a year you will be a bin-bashi (a colonel of artillery);
                  in five years you will be a bey; in ten years, inshallah—please God—a pasha. I
                  will answer for it, that when your messenger comes to the chorbajee, he will send
                  back words pleasant to your heart. Even now, you can do more to win his friendship
                  than if you could offer him the dowry of a pasha's daughter. You know that the
                  evil advisers who surround the sultan, and pervert his mind, have persuaded him to
                  take away the ancient privileges of the Janissaries, and alter their laws and
                  customs, which were established by the great and wise Sultan Urkham, and the holy
                  dervish Hadji Bectash. But the Janissaries are strong, and will maintain their
                  rights in spite of traitors and evil counsellors; and when they meet in their
                  ortas, with their camp-kettles borne before them, and require the restitution of
                  their old laws and privileges, and demand the heads of their enemies, be assured
                  that they will obtain both the one and the other. Whether they will prevail
                  without much fighting and bloodshed, is another matter. Allah only knows. But
                  this, dear Saduk, is what I would teach you, that you may know how to win the
                  favor of the chorbajee. Of all the troops of the nizam djedid, there are none
                  which are not as dust, as bosh (nothing) in the eyes of the Janissaries, save only
                  the artillery. Most of these, as you know, were formerly Janissaries, or friends
                  of the Janissaries, and will be loath to fight against them. It is their officers
                  alone who are strangers and enemies to the Janissaries. If now there could be
                  found one officer of the tobjees—one yuzbashi—who, in the hour of conflict, would
                  say to his men, 'Do not fire upon your brethren, the children of Hadji Bectash,'
                  they would all obey at the word, and the victory would be secure to the good cause
                  without more blood. Surely, Saduk, dear friend, child of Atteghai," she said,
                  bending forward, and looking imploringly into his darkened face, "you will not
                  fire upon my husband—upon the father of my daughter Shereen."
               "This is a snare!" exclaimed the soldier, rising hastily from his seat, and
                  gathering his mantle about him. "What dust is this that you would have me eat?
                  Shall I dishonor my father's grave? Shall I break my oath to the sultan for a
                  handsome face? Is this becoming the daughter of Atteghai, to mislead her
                  countryman to disgrace and ruin? Know that for seven years I have carried my life
                  in the hollow of my hand, ready to throw it away at the first warning; but my
                  faith I have kept secure, holding it a thousand times dearer to me than life. This
                  is the law of Atteghai. Have you never heard the history of Mehemet Gherrai, my
                  ancestor, how he gave himself up to death to redeem his word? Farewell, hanoum; I
                  truly believe that your daughter knows nothing of this deception, else she would
                  have been with you. For her sake, and the sake of our common blood, I pardon you
                  this evil design, and may hereafter do you good."
               So saying, before the dame could recover from her confusion, he hastily thrust
                  aside the curtains which concealed the entrance to the room, and seizing the slave
                  by the arm, drew his poniard, and bade her show him the way to the door. The
                  terrified negress obeyed without hesitation, and Saduk presently found himself in
                  the street. Taking, as near as he could judge, the direction of the port, he
                  hurried forward until he reached the aqueduct of Valens. Here, while he stood concealed in the shadow of an arch,
                  he heard the tramp of a body of men approaching, and presently about a hundred
                  soldiers in the Janissary uniform, completely armed, passed at a rapid pace within
                  a few feet of him. From the course which they pursued, he had no doubt that their
                  object was to surprise their aga, who was especially obnoxious to them, from the
                  part which he had taken in favor of the new regulations. This, then, was the
                  commencement of the insurrection. As soon as they were out of hearing, he turned
                  and hurried in another direction towards the Ayazmah landing. On arriving, he
                  roused a boatman from his slumbers, and bade him row as rapidly as possible to
                  Tophana. Twenty minutes brought them thither; and the young man hastened directly
                  to the quarters of his commander, the tobjee-bashi. The latter had directed his
                  slaves to awaken him on the arrival of any important intelligence, and Saduk was
                  quickly ordered before him. When the commander heard his statement, he said, "You
                  bring great news, yuzbashi. This must go directly to the padishah. We will proceed
                  to Beshiktash together in the caique which brought you hither. Beybars," he
                  continued, turning to his orderly in waiting, "tell Kara Jehennem to make sure
                  that his gun-carriages are in good order, and that his men are staunch. I
                  foresee," he added, "a day of bloody work, in which we tobjees shall have to bear
                  the heaviest share."
               So saying, he proceeded with Saduk to the landing, and put off in the caique for
                  Beshiktash. They were half an hour in reaching the palace, where they found that
                  the sultan, as became a sovereign whose empire was trembling in the balance, had
                  been up all night, engaged in close consultation with his ministers. The
                  grand-vizier, the mufti, the aga pasha, the Janissary aga, the capudan pasha, and
                  other great officers of state, were present in the council. The tobjee-bashi was
                  admitted at once, and Saduk was presently summoned to the council-chamber. He
                  found the sultan sitting on a pile of cushions at the upper end of the apartment,
                  while his ministers stood near him on either hand. Mahmoud's dark-blue eyes
                  glittered with vindictive pleasure, and his naturally sallow cheek was flushed
                  with joyful excitement. "Ha!" he exclaimed, as Saduk approached, and made his
                  military obeisance, "it is the Cherkess who has brought the good news. You have
                  done well, yuzbashi: it shall not be forgotten. At what hour did you see these
                  dogs of Sheitan, and how many were there of them?"
               "Asylum of the world!" replied the Circassian, "it was shortly after midnight,
                  when your servant saw about a hundred of the rebels, on their way seemingly to the
                  dwelling of his lordship the aga."
               "The curs! the miscreants!" exclaimed Mahmoud. "You did well, aga, to remove your
                  harem in time, for nothing will be sacred to these wretches. You are all
                  witnesses, pashas, that it is they who have begun the conflict, and not I. This
                  day shall decide who is to govern henceforth in Stamboul—the sultan or the
                  Janissaries. If it be these dogs, I will retire to Asia, and leave the city and
                  the western empire to them. But wherever I am, there I will be king. Come, pashas,
                  now that the work is commenced, our place is in the city. Let every one perform
                  his part, according to the plan which we have sanctioned."
               With these words the council broke up. The sultan and his principal ministers
                  proceeded immediately to the seraglio, and walked from thence in solemn procession
                  to the imperial mosque of Sultan Ahmed, near the ancient Hippodrome. Here a
                  ceremony of great importance took place. The Sandjak Shereef, or sacred standard
                  of Islam—made, it is said, of the apparel of the Prophet, and only produced on the
                  most momentous occasions—was brought
                  out from the treasury, in which it had lain for fifty years, and set up on the
                  pulpit. Standing beneath it, the mufti and the ulemas—the three heads of the
                  Mahomedan faith—pronounced a solemn anathema upon the rebels, and devoted the
                  whole body of the Janissaries to destruction. The news of this proceeding quickly
                  spread through the city, and produced a decisive effect. The mass of the
                  population had previously been wavering between their devotion to their sovereign
                  and their ancient sympathies for the rebellious troops. But when the influences of
                  religion were enlisted in favor of the former, there was no longer any hesitation;
                  the great majority of the citizens came forth in a tumultuous throng, and swelled
                  the number of the forces which were advancing from all sides against the
                  insurgents.
               The latter, after sacking the palaces of the Janissary aga and the grand-vizier,
                  and making an ineffectual assault upon the seraglio, had retired to their square,
                  the Etmeidan; and there having inverted their camp-kettles, according to their
                  usual custom when in a state of revolt, they appointed a deputation to lay before
                  the sultan their demands—namely, the restoration of all their ancient privileges,
                  and the death of the four ministers whom they considered their chief enemies. But
                  while thus engaged, they neglected, with unaccountable infatuation, to take any
                  precaution against the approach of the various corps of regular troops which were
                  gradually occupying every avenue leading to the Etmeidan. Thus, when the
                  Janissaries received the positive refusal of their demands, together with the
                  alternative of submission or instant destruction, they found themselves hemmed in
                  on all sides by the hated troops of the nizam djedid. A sense of their dangerous
                  position then first seized upon them, and they made a furious and simultaneous
                  effort to break down the living barrier which inclosed them, with the intention of
                  spreading themselves through the city, and setting fire to it in every
                  quarter.
               The principal rush was directed towards a narrow street, occupied by a body of
                  flying artillery, with two guns loaded with grape. The leader of this body was an
                  officer noted for his great size and strength, his swarthy and forbidding
                  countenance, and his relentless determination, all of which traits had procured
                  him the appellation, by which he was usually known, of Kara Jehennem, or the
                  "Black Infernal." It was supposed that the dread and respect which the tobjees
                  entertained for him would serve to counteract their well known sympathies for
                  their former comrades. Thus far the expectation had been fulfilled; for the men
                  had fought with vigor in repelling the attack of the Janissaries upon the
                  seraglio. But now, when the mighty mass came rolling towards them, calling on the
                  sacred names of the Prophet and Hadji Bectash, and shouting to the gunners the
                  watchwords of their ancient fellowship, the hearts of the latter failed them, and
                  they drew suddenly back from their guns, carrying their officers with them. In
                  another moment the pieces would have been in possession of the insurgents. It was
                  the crisis, if not of the Ottoman empire, at least of the reign of Mahmoud. Kara
                  Jehennem, who stood in front of his troops, with his yataghan in one hand and a
                  pistol in the other, when he found himself thus left alone by their retreat, took
                  his resolution with the unhesitating boldness of his character. He shook his
                  sabre, with a terrible imprecation, at his recreant soldiers, and then, springing
                  to one of the guns, fired his pistol over the priming. The Janissaries were close
                  upon the piece when it was discharged, and the effect of the grape upon their
                  dense column was tremendous. The whole mass recoiled in confusion, which the
                  discharge of the second gun, by another hand, turned to a headlong flight.
               
               "Aferin, Cherkess!"—("Well done,
                  Circassian!"—exclaimed Kara Jehennem; "that shot has made you a colonel. Come on,
                  dogs, cowards, sons of burnt fathers!" he shouted to the tobjees. "Your guns
                  to-day, or the bowstring to-morrow."
               The gunners needed no further menace to make them return to their duty, and the
                  guns were quickly manned and brought forward to take part in the deadly shower of
                  grape and musketry which was now pouring, with fearful effect, upon the rebels in
                  the Etmeidan. Presently a cry was raised among the latter, "To the kislas—to the
                  barracks!" The barracks of the Janissaries adjoined the Etmeidan, and the revolted
                  troops, now taking refuge in them, defended themselves there with desperate
                  resolution. The aga pasha sent to inquire of the sultan if he should endeavor once
                  more to make terms with the insurgents before proceeding to the last extremity.
                  The answer was brief and decisive—"Set fire to the kislas!"
               The stern command was unhesitatingly obeyed. In a few moments the barracks were
                  enveloped in flames; but not even the prospect of the dreadful and inevitable
                  death which awaited them could induce the Janissaries to sue for the mercy which
                  they had before rejected, and which they probably felt would now be refused them.
                  They fought on, with the fury of despair, until the greater number were buried in
                  the burning ruins. A portion of them sallied forth, and attempted to cut their way
                  through the line of their enemies. In the conflict which ensued, Kara Jehennem
                  fell with a bullet through his hip. "Die, dog!" shouted an old chorbajee, rushing
                  towards him with uplifted yataghan; "down to Jehennem, where you belong!"
               "Not yet, uncle Osman," replied the "Black Infernal;" and raising himself on his
                  left elbow, he fired his pistol at the Janissary, saying, "Take that, old friend,
                  for your good wishes."
               The chorbajee stopped suddenly, and struck his hand to his side; then springing
                  like a tiger upon the ranks of the tobjees, be cut down two men by successive
                  blows of his yataghan, and fled swiftly up the street towards the mosque of Raghil
                  Pasha, closely pursued by a party of the soldiers. All resistance was now at an
                  end, but the work of destruction did not cease. Every Janissary who was found
                  within the walls of Stamboul, whether concerned in the late revolt or not, was put
                  to death without mercy. The bowstring and the Bosphorus completed what the cannon
                  and the sabre had begun; and within twenty-four hours, that formidable body, which
                  for four centuries and a half had been by turns the bulwark and the scourge of the
                  Ottoman empire, was utterly annihilated. Its very name was made accursed, and a
                  heavy penalty denounced upon any one who should utter it. Twenty thousand men are
                  supposed to have perished in consummating this brief but sanguinary revolution,
                  for such its objects and its consequences entitle it to be called.
               During the conflict, Saduk had distinguished himself both by his courage and
                  presence of mind. But he felt no disposition to take part in the massacre which
                  followed, and was about to withdraw from the scene, when a sudden recollection
                  flashed upon him, and caused an immediate change of purpose. Collecting a few of
                  his men, he hastened towards the dwelling of the Chorbajee Osman, which he had no
                  difficulty in discovering. He arrived just in time. The old Janissary, mortally
                  wounded by the pistol-shot of Kara Jehennem, had fled to the privacy of his harem
                  to die. In ordinary times, even the executioners of the law do not venture to
                  violate this sacred refuge; but the solemn anathema pronounced upon the rebels
                  removed all scruples of this nature,
                  and Osman's pursuers had just broken into the apartment, where the affrighted
                  women were clustered in speechless horror about the dying man. Saduk's appearance
                  saved him from the last indignity of the bowstring, and preserved the females from
                  insult. In gratitude for this service, the old chorbajee, by a will pronounced
                  upon the spot, as the Moslem law allows, bequeathed to the young man all his
                  wealth, on condition that he continued to extend his protection to Shereen and her
                  mother. This condition being anything but an onerous one, the trust was promptly
                  accepted by the youthful soldier. The will, it is true, as made by a rebel who had
                  forfeited his property by his guilt, would have been of no avail but for the favor
                  of the sultan, who not only confirmed it, but also bestowed upon the Circassian
                  the rank which Kara Jehennem had promised him. Shereen, it is hardly necessary to
                  add, became the wife of the fortunate adventurer; and her mother, with the third
                  of her late husband's ample fortune, was able to fulfil a long-cherished vision,
                  of returning in splendid state to the land of her nativity.
            
            
               Leaves from the Diary of a Law Clerk.
               THE reader must not expect any artistic finish or coloring in such brief
                  transcripts as I can furnish of by-gone passages in my clerkly experience.
                  Law-writers and romance-writers are very distinct classes of penmen, and I am
                  consequently quite aware that these sketches have no other claim to attention than
                  that they are genuine excerpts,—writ large,—from a journal in which the incidents
                  of the day were faithfully noted down at the time of their occurrence. Their
                  accuracy, therefore, does not depend upon memory, which certainly I do not find to
                  be as virile and tenacious at seventy as it was at seventeen. No one will feel
                  surprised that I should, in my vocation, have turned over several startling leaves
                  in the darker chapters of our social history; and some of these, I have thought,
                  may prove even more interesting to a numerous class of minds, when plainly and
                  unpretendingly set forth, than if tricked out in the showy varnish and false
                  jewels of romance and fanciful invention.
               On the evening previous to the day, Mr.——,—suppose, for convenience sake, we call
                  him Mr. Prince, he was one in many respects,—on the evening, then, previous to
                     the day Mr. Prince, a barrister,
                  whose clerk I had been for about three years, intended setting out for the second
                  time on the Western Circuit, a somewhat unusual circumstance, or rather couple of
                  circumstances, occurred. I must premise that Mr. Prince had at the previous assize
                  made a great hit at Salisbury, by a successful objection to an indictment framed
                  under 30th Geo. 2, which charged a respectably-connected young man with stealing a
                  sum of money in bank notes. Mr. Prince contended that bank notes were not "moneys,
                  wares, goods, or merchandise," within the meaning of the statute, an opinion in
                  which the judge, Mr. Baron Thompson, after much argumentation, coincided, and the
                  prisoner was acquitted and discharged. This hugely astonished the horticultural
                  mind of Wiltshire: a lawyer who could prove a bank note, then a legal tender, not
                  to be money, was universally admitted to be a match, and something to spare, for
                  any big-wig on the circuit, and a full share of briefs would, it was pretty
                  certain, thenceforth fall to Mr. Prince's share.
               And now, to return to the circumstances I was speaking of. I was waiting at
                  chambers in the Temple on the evening in question for Mr. Prince, when who should
                  bustle in but old Dodsley, the attorney, of Chancery Lane. Many persons must still
                  remember old Dodsley, or at all events his powdered pig-tail, gold eye-glass,
                  tasseled hessian boots, and everlasting pepper-and-salt pants. This visit
                  surprised me, for the spruce and consequential antique had not hitherto patronized
                  us, we not having as yet, I supposed, a sufficient relish of age about us to suit
                  his taste.
               "Mr. Prince," he said, "of course goes the Western Circuit? To be sure, to be
                  sure. Is he retained in the Salisbury case of the King on the prosecution of
                  Gilbert against Somers?"
               I knew perfectly well he was not, but of course I replied that I would look, and
                  passed my finger slowly and deliberately down the page of an entry-book. "No, he
                  is not," I said, on reaching the foot of the leaf.
               "Then here is a retainer for the defence." Dodsley placed a one pound note and a
                  shilling on the table, and, as soon as I had made the usual entry, added, "I am
                  acting in this matter for Cotes, of Salisbury, who, as the case is of some
                  importance, will deliver the brief, handsomely marked, I believe, and with a good
                  fee to clerk, at Winchester; good-by!"
               A quarter of an hour afterwards, the great Mr. Pendergast, solicitor, of
                  Basinghall Street, ascended the stairs, and presented himself. He had a brief in
                  his hand, marked "Fifty Guineas." This I saw at a glance: indeed, of all the
                  characters on the back of a brief, the figures,—the fee,—by some magnetic
                  attraction or influence, invariably caught my eye first.
               "Mr. Prince proceeds on the Western Circuit?"
               "Certainly."
               "And is not, I conclude, retained in the Crown case against Somers for
                  larceny?"
               "The deuce! well, this is odd!" I exclaimed. "Mr. Dodsley left a
                  retainer for the defence not above ten minutes ago."
               "You don't say so!" rejoined Mr. Pendergast, peevishly; "dear me, dear me; how
                  unfortunate! The prosecutrix is anxious above all things to secure Mr. Prince's
                  services, and now—dear me! This is a kind of business not at all in our line; nor
                  indeed in that of the respectable Devizes firm who have taken the unusual course
                  of sending the brief to London, although relating only to a simple matter of
                  larceny;—dear me, how unfortunate! and the fee, you see, is heavy."
               "Surprisingly so, indeed! The prosecutrix must be wonderfully anxious to secure a conviction," I
                  replied with as much nonchalance as I could
                  assume, confoundedly vexed as I was. It was not at all likely, for all old Dodsley
                  had hinted, that the brief in defence of a prisoner committed for larceny would be
                  marked at a tenth of fifty guineas: however, there was no help for it, and after
                  emitting one or two additional "dear mes!" away went Mr. Pendergast with brief,
                  fifty guineas, and no doubt proportionately handsome clerk's fee, in his pocket. I
                  was terribly put out, much more so than Mr. Prince, when he came in and heard of
                  what had happened, although fifty guineas were fifty guineas with him at that
                  time. "I have seen something of the case," he said, "in the newspapers; it has
                  curious features. The prisoner is a female of great personal attractions, it
                  seems. We must console ourselves," he added with jocose familiarity, "it is
                  something to be the chosen champion of beauty in distress." To which remark I
                  perceive the word "Fudge," in large capitals, appended in my diary. "Humbug" would
                  have been more forcible, but that expressive word had not then been imported into
                  the English vocabulary, or it would, I doubt not, have been used.
               Mr. Prince of course travelled by post-chaise with a learned brother, and I
                  reached Winchester by coach, just as the sheriff's trumpets proclaimed the arrival
                  of my lords the judges in that ancient city. Our Wiltshire fame had not yet
                  reached Winchester, and although the criminal business of the assize was heavy,
                  very few cases were confided to Mr. Prince. Cotes arrived on the second day, with
                  the brief in the Salisbury case, marked, I was astonished to find, "Twenty
                  Guineas," and the old fellow behaved, moreover, very well to me. Mr. Prince was in
                  court, and I had full leisure to run over the matter, and a very strange,
                  out-of-the-way, perplexing business, as set forth in Mr. Cotes's instruction to
                  counsel, it appeared to be. Divested of surplusage plusage, of which the brief
                  contained an abundant quantity, the affair stood about thus:—Mr. Hurdley, a
                  wealthy person, who had resided many years at Hurdley Villa (then so called, but
                  now, I hear, bearing another appellation, and not very distant, by-the-by, from
                  Bowood, the Marquis of Lansdowne's country seat), had died three or four months
                  previously intestate, and Hurdley Villa was now inhabited by a Mrs. Gilbert, the
                  deceased's sister-in-law, and her son, Charles Gilbert, the heir-at-law, but who
                  yet wanted some ten months of his majority. The day before his death Mr. Hurdley
                  despatched James Dakin, an aged and confidential servant, to bring home one Emily
                  Somers from Brighton, where he, Mr. Hurdley, had placed her some fourteen years
                  previously in a first-rate school. He told the mistress of the establishment, a
                  Mrs. Ryland, that the child, then about five years old, was the orphan daughter of
                  a distant relative, a statement discredited as she grew up by the evidence of her
                  features, described as presenting a beautiful and feminine but still surprisingly
                  accurate reflex of those of Mr. Hurdley. This remarkable resemblance not only gave
                  rise to calumnious rumors, but appeared greatly to impress Mr. Hurdley himself, at
                  the last and only interview he ever had with the young girl since he consigned her
                  to Mrs. Ryland's care. This was about six months before he died, and on his return
                  home he gave Mr. Cotes directions to prepare a new will, by which he bequeathed
                  twenty thousand pounds to Emily Somers, and divided the residue, about double that
                  amount, amongst his nephew, Charles Gilbert, and other more distant relatives.
                  This will was drawn out and executed, but was subsequently destroyed under the
                  following circumstances:—The instant Mrs. Gilbert heard of the serious illness of
                  her wealthy brother-in-law, she hastened with her son to Hurdley Villa, and
                  immediately set to work, tormenting the dying gentleman into annulling his will. Wearied out at length, it
                  seemed, by Mrs. Gilbert's importunities, he yielded the point, and the will was
                  burnt in the presence of Cotes, the attorney, a medical gentleman of Devizes, Mrs.
                  Gilbert, and the housekeeper, a Mrs. James. "You persist, Charlotte," said Mr.
                  Hurdley, feebly addressing his sister-in-law, "that Emily Somers ought not to
                  inherit under this will?" "I do, indeed, my dear Robert; you may be sure she will
                  be sufficiently provided for without the necessity of your bequeathing her such an
                  enormous sum as twenty thousand pounds." "Are the two letters I gave you sent to
                  the post?" asked Mr. Hurdley of the housekeeper. The woman hesitated for a moment,
                  and then said, "Oh yes, certainly; some time since." A strange expression,
                  something like mockery or malice, Cotes thought flickered over the pale face of
                  the dying man as he said, addressing the attorney, "Then I authorize and require
                  you, sir, to burn that my last and only existing testament." This was done, and
                  everybody except the medical gentleman left the room. Mrs. Gilbert vanished
                  instantly her wish was accomplished, following sharply upon the heels of her
                  housekeeper.
               Mr. Hurdley died on the following day. He was already speechless, though still
                  conscious, when Dakin returned from Brighton with Emily Somers, upon whom his
                  fast-darkening eyes rested whilst yet a ray of light remained, with an intense
                  expression of anxiety and tenderness. The wealth, I may here state, of which Mr.
                  Hurdley died possessed, was almost entirely personal, Hurdley Villa and grounds
                  being, indeed, the only reality, and was lodged in British securities. It was the
                  intention, Mr. Cotes believed, of Mrs. Gilbert and her son, the instant the latter
                  came of age and could legally do so, to dispose of those securities, and invest
                  the produce in land: that time was, however, not yet arrived.
               Matters went on smoothly enough at Hurdley Villa for some time after Mr. Hurdley's
                  death; Mrs. Gilbert was exceedingly civil and kind to Emily Somers;—her son, from
                  the first, something more; and it was soon apparent that he was becoming deeply
                  attached to the gentle and graceful girl bequeathed to his mother's and his own
                  generous care by her deceased protector. These advances, evidently at first
                  encouraged by Mrs. Gilbert, were by no means favorably received,—why, will
                  presently appear,—whereupon that lady worked herself into a violent rage, both
                  with her son's folly and the intolerable airs and presumptions of Emily Somers,
                  who had forthwith notice to quit Hurdley Villa, accompanied by an intimation that
                  an annuity of fifty pounds a year would be settled on her. This scandalous
                  injustice roused the spirit of the young girl, acquainted as she was with the
                  burning of the will, and a violent altercation ensued between her and Mrs.
                  Gilbert, in the course of which something was said or hinted that excited Mrs.
                  Gilbert to downright frenzy, and she vowed the insolent, audacious minx should not
                  sleep another night in the house. This scene occurred just after breakfast, and a
                  chaise was ordered to be in readiness by two o'clock to convey Emily Somers to
                  Devizes. About half-past twelve Mrs. Gilbert went out for an airing in the
                  carriage, and was gone about an hour; her passion had by this time cooled down,
                  and the servants thought, from the irresolute, half regretful expression of her
                  countenance, that a conciliatory word from Miss Somers would have procured her
                  permission to remain. That word was not spoken, and Mrs. Gilbert, with a stiff bow
                  to the young lady, who was already equipped for departure, sailed grandly away to
                  her dressing-room. In about ten minutes a terrible hurly-burly rang through the
                  house: Mrs. Gilbert's diamond necklace and cross was declared to be missing from
                  her jewel case, and a hurried search in all possible and impossible places was immediately commenced. Miss
                  Somers, distracted as she said by the noise and confusion, intimated that she
                  should walk on and meet the chaise, which could not be far distant; and "as Mrs.
                  Gilbert," she added with bitter emphasis, "insists that every trunk in the house
                  shall be searched, I will send for mine to-morrow." So saying she left the
                  apartment, and a minute afterwards the house. The post-chaise was not far off, and
                  she had reached it, and seated herself, when a footman came running up with a
                  request from Mrs. Gilbert that she would return immediately. Miss Somers declined
                  doing so, and ordered the postillion to drive on. Seeing this, the footman, a
                  powerful fellow, caught hold of the horses' heads, exclaiming, as he did so, "that
                  it was a matter of robbery, and the young lady should return." The chaise was
                  accordingly turned round, and the now terrified girl was in a manner forcibly
                  taken back to Hurdley Villa. There it was proposed to search her. She vehemently
                  protested against being subjected to such an indignity, but Mrs. Gilbert
                  peremptorily insisted that she should, and a constable having been actually sent
                  for, she, at length, reluctantly submitted. The search was fruitless, and Mrs.
                  Gilbert, taking up the young lady's muff,—it was the month of January,—which was
                  lying in a chair, tossed it contemptuously towards her, with an intimation that
                  "she might now go!" The muff fell short, and dropped on the floor. A slight sound
                  was heard. "Ha! what's that?" exclaimed Mrs. Gilbert. Quickly the muff was seized,
                  felt, turned inside out, ripped, and the missing diamond necklace and cross were
                  found carefully enveloped and concealed in the lining! Miss Somers fainted, and
                  had only partially recovered when she found herself again in the chaise, and this
                  time accompanied by a constable, who was conveying her to prison. The unfortunate
                  young lady was ultimately committed for trial on the charge of stealing the
                  jewels. Miss Somers's refusal to entertain the suit of Mr. Charles Gilbert, and
                  the large fee marked on the brief in defence, were explained by the fact that a
                  Lieut. Horace Wyndham, of the artillery service, then serving in Ireland, had,
                  when at Brighton, contracted an engagement with Emily Somers, fully sanctioned,
                  Cotes believed, by the late Mr. Hurdley. This young officer remitted a
                  considerable sum to the attorney, with directions that no expense should be
                  spared; and further stated that he had applied for leave of absence, and should,
                  the instant it was granted, hasten to Wiltshire.
               This was the tangled web of circumstance which it was hoped the ingenuity of
                  counsel might unravel, but how, Mr. Cotes, a well-meaning, plodding
                  individual, but scarcely as bright as the north star, did not profess to
                  understand. Mr. Prince took great interest in the matter, and he speedily came to
                  the conclusion that it was highly desirable Miss Somers should be directly
                  communicated with. The etiquette of the bar of course precluded Mr. Prince from
                  himself visiting a prisoner, but I, though it was rather out of my line of
                  service, might do so, by permission of Mr. Cotes. This was readily accorded, and
                  the next day I and the attorney set off for Salisbury.
               We had an interview with Miss Somers early on the following morning. All my
                  clerkish bounce was thoroughly taken out of me by the appearance and demeanor of
                  the young lady. There was a dignified serenity of grief imprinted on her fine pale
                  countenance, a proud yet tempered scorn of the accusation and the accuser in her
                  calm accents, so different from the half-swaggering, half-whining tone and manner
                  I had been accustomed to in persons so situated, that my conviction of her perfect
                  innocence was instantaneous and complete. She, however, threw no light upon the
                  originating motive of the prosecution to which she was exposed, till, after
                  refreshing my memory by a glance at the
                  notes Mr. Prince had written for my guidance, I asked her what it was she had said
                  on the occasion of her quarrel with Mrs. Gilbert that had so exasperated that
                  lady? "I merely ventured," she replied, "to hazard a hint suggested by an
                  expression used by Mr. Hurdley in a letter to—to a gentleman I have reason to
                  believe Mr. Cotes will see to-day or to-morrow, to the effect that I might after
                  all prove to be the rightful heiress of the wealth so covetously grasped. It was a
                  rash and a foolish remark," she added sadly, her momentarily crimsoned cheeks and
                  sparkling eyes fading again to paleness and anxiety, "for which there was no
                  tangible foundation, although Mrs. Gilbert must, it seems, have feared there might
                  be."
               This very partial lifting of the veil which concealed the secret promptings of the
                  determined and rancorous prosecution directed against our interesting client,
                  rendered me buoyantly hopeful of the result, and so I told Cotes on leaving the
                  prison. He, however, remained like old Chancellor Eldon, permanently "doubtful,"
                  and moreover, stared like a conjuror, which he was not, when, after again
                  consulting Mr. Prince's memoranda, I said he must let me have two subpœnas for
                  service on Mrs. James and Mr. Dakin at Hurdley Villa.
               "Nonsense!" he exclaimed; "what will be the use of calling them?"
               "I don't know; a great deal of use, it may be; but at all events the subpœnas will
                  give me an excuse for seeing them both, and that I must do as early as
                  possible."
               He made no further objection, and by eleven the next day I was at the hall door of
                  Hurdley Villa, blandly requesting to speak with Mrs. James. I have always piqued
                  myself upon not having the slightest odor of law or parchment about me, and I was
                  only gratified, therefore, not surprised—ahem!—at overhearing the servant who
                  answered swered the door assure Mrs. James that the person inquiring for her "was
                  quite the gentleman." This was, moreover, only a fair return for the compliment I
                  had paid the damsel's blooming cheeks. I was immediately ushered into the
                  housekeeper's room, where, as soon as the door was closed, I handed the astonished
                  woman a strip of parchment and a shilling. She hopped back as if suddenly
                  confronted by a serpent.
               "A subpœna, Mrs. James," I said," commanding you, in the name of our Sovereign
                  Lord the King, to attend and give evidence on the trial of Emily Somers."
               "I give evidence!" she replied, much flurried; "I know nothing of the matter; I
                  wash my hands of the whole business."
               "That will require, my dear lady, a very profuse and judicious use of soap and
                  water, or the damned spots will not out, as the lady says in the play."
               "Oh, don't bother me about the lady in the play," she retorted angrily. "I can
                  give no evidence, I tell you, either for or against Miss Somers. I did not accuse
                  her of stealing the necklace!"
               "That I am sure, Mrs. James, you did not. You are, I know, too just and sensible a
                  person to do anything at once so wicked and foolish, but you must
                  tell the judge how it was the two letters—ha! you begin to perceive, do you, that
                  more is known than you imagined."
               "Letters—what letters?" she muttered with pale lips.
               The words which had so startled her had been suggested by a surmise of Mr. Prince,
                  and a remark which dropped from Miss Somers, implying that Lieutenant Wyndham had
                  been expecting a promised explanation from Mr. Hurdley when the news reached him
                  of that gentleman's death. The woman's tremor convinced me that I had struck the
                  right trail, and I determined to follow it up boldly.
               
               "I will tell you, Mrs. James," I replied, "but first, and for your own sake,
                  ascertain that we are entirely alone." She looked into the passage, reclosed the
                  door, and said with fast-increasing agitation, "Quite, quite alone; what
                     can you mean?"
               "This: the two letters intrusted to you by Mr. Hurdley, the day before his death,
                  you had neglected to forward as you ought to have done."
               "I—I meant no harm," she huskily gasped; "as I live and breathe I meant no
                  harm!"
               "I believe you; and it was after the will was burned that Mrs.
                  Gilbert, who followed you out of the sick room, obtained possession of them."
               She did not answer in words, and it was not necessary that she should; her scared
                  looks did that sufficiently.
               "Do you remember either of the addresses of the letters, Mrs. James," I presently
                  continued, " or shall I refresh your memory? Was not the first syllable of one of
                  the names Lieutenant Wyndham—"
               "Ha!"
               "Now don't make a noise, there's a good woman. To whom was the second letter
                  addressed? Answer that question, or you will be in custody before ten minutes have
                  passed; answer it truly, and you will not be in the slightest degree
                  molested;—come, out with it!"
               "The Reverend Mr. Ridgway, Yeovil, Somerset."
               "Very good. And do you know anything about this Mr. Ridgway, whether he was
                  related to, or in any way connected with, the late Mr. Hurdley?"
               "As I hope for mercy, I do not."
               "Very well: now pay attention to what I am about to say. Mrs. Gilbert must not be
                  acquainted with what has passed between us."
               "Oh, no, certainly not; on no account whatever," she quickly replied. "She
                  strictly forbade me to mention the circumstance."
               "No doubt. As she is sure, however, to hear that I have been here, you had better
                  admit that I have served you with a subpœna. Good day," I added, taking her hand,
                  which was cold as ice,—"and remember—SILENCE! or it will go ill with you."
               "Come, George," I mentally exclaimed on emerging with exultant step from Hurdley
                  Villa, "come, George,"—my name is George—"you are getting along in
                  first-rate style, my boy; and there is nobody I wish half so well as I do you. I
                  am heartily rejoiced at it. Old Dakin is at Devizes, it seems; well, I don't know
                  that it's worth while waiting to see him, so I'll e'en be off again back at
                  once."
               The news I brought which, well managed, would in all probability lead to important
                  results, put quite a varnish on old Cotes's mahogany phiz, and it was needed, for
                  Lieutenant Wyndham, who had arrived at Salisbury shortly after I had left, had
                  kept him in a state of terrible anxiety and harassment from the first moment he
                  entered the office. He was a fine dashing young fellow, by Cotes's account, sudden
                  and fiery as a rocket, and at first seriously purposed to send a bullet through
                  young Gilbert's head, as the only fitting answer to the atrociously absurd
                  accusation against Miss Somers. Convinced at last that ball practice, however
                  sharp and well directed, would avail little against a "true bill" for felony, he
                  bounced off to procure permission to visit the imprisoned lady. This could not be
                  for the moment granted, "and," added Cotes, "he has been tearing in and out of the
                  office for the last hour and a half like a furious maniac, threatening to write
                  immediately to the Home Secretary, nay, the Prince Regent himself, I believe, and
                  utterly smash every gaoler, sheriff, and magistrate in the county of Wilts;—oh,
                  here he is again!"
               
               The youthful soldier certainly was much excited and exasperated, but I found no
                  difficulty in so far calming him that he listened with eager attention and
                  interest to what I had to relate. "I cannot do better," he exclaimed, the instant
                  I ceased speaking," than start immediately for Yeovil, and ascertain what the Rev.
                  Mr. Ridgway knows of Em—of Mr. Somers or Mr. Hurdley." We agreed that it was
                  highly desirable he should do so, and in less than ten minutes he was off in a
                  post-chaise from the "Antelope" for Yeovil.
               The next day, Saturday, as I and Cotes were busy, about noon, drawing a fresh
                  brief for counsel, a horseman, followed by a mounted groom, alighted in front of
                  the attorney's house, and presently a small clerk threw open the office door and
                  announced—"Mr. Gilbert!"
               The appearance of this young gentleman was somewhat prepossessing, albeit he
                  appeared to be suffering from illness of body or mind, perhaps of both; and there
                  was a changing flush on his brow, a quick restlessness in his eyes, and a febrile
                  tremor, as it were, in his whole aspect and manner, which, read by the light of
                  what we knew and suspected, had a deep significance.
               "You are the attorney for the defence, I understand, in"—he hesitatingly
                  began,—"in the unfortunate affair of the diamond necklace?"
               "I am," replied Mr. Cotes, "and what then?"
               "Your clerk has served a subpœna upon Mrs. Gilbert's housekeeper; what may that
                  mean?"
               "A silly question, sir, you will pardon me for saying: we lawyers are not
                  generally in the habit of making confidants of those opposed to us."
               There was a silence for some time; Mr. Gilbert crossing his legs, tapped the toe
                  of his boot with his riding-whip, and passed his right-hand fingers several times
                  through the thick brown locks that fell over his forehead, his irresolute,
                  wavering glance all the while shifting from Cotes's face to mine and back
                  again.
               "Would it not be better," he at length said, "that this unhappy business were
                  accommodated? There is a means—one," he added, flushing intensest scarlet,
                  "whereby that desirable result may be accomplished. I must be frank with you, for
                  I cannot otherwise communicate with the—the prisoner; it is this,—if Miss Somers
                  will accept my hand, the prosecution is at an end."
               Cotes was about to speak, but I pinched him with such sudden force that he sprang
                  to his feet instead, and the first attempted word broke into a shriek of pain.
               "Is this proposition made with Mrs. Gilbert's consent?" I hastily interposed.
               "Yes, certainly;—yes."
               "Mrs. Gilbert consents, does she, that her son shall wed a fortuneless girl
                  accused of the disgraceful crime of theft, her character unvindicated, her—"
               "Stay, sir, a moment. I speak of course in confidence. If my proposal be accepted,
                  I will say that I placed the necklace in the muff in jest, or as a present."
               "Do you say, Mr. Gilbert," I exclaimed, "that it was you, not your
                     mother, that placed the jewels in the lining of the muff?"
               Ha! ha! That shaft, I saw, found the joint in his armor. He started fiercely to
                  his feet. "What do you mean by that, fellow?"
               "Precisely what I said, sir. Mr. Cotes," I added, "you can have
                  nothing more to say to this person."
               "Certainly not," snapped out the attorney, who was limping about the room, and
                  rubbing one particular part of his left thigh with savage energy.
               The young gentleman, finding that his conciliatorymission sion had missed fire, began to bully,
                  but that failing also he went his way, muttering and threatening as he went. And I
                  soon afterwards departed, after very humbly apologizing to Mr. Cotes for the
                  extreme liberty I had taken with his still very painful leg.
               On Monday, the day the Commission was opened at Salisbury, Lieutenant Wyndham
                  brought us the Reverend Mr. Ridgway. What he had to say was this:—Mr. Hurdley had
                  married privately, for fear of his father's displeasure, Emily Ridgway, the
                  reverend gentleman's sister, at Bridge-water. The marriage was a most unhappy one;
                  a causeless, morbid jealousy possessed the husband to such an extent that he
                  believed, or affected to believe, that the child, a girl, baptized Emily, in
                  giving birth to whom her mother died, was not his; but this child, so Mr. Hurdley
                  wrote to the Reverend Mr. Ridgway, died at the age of four years.
               The reader is now quite as wise as the wisest in the consultation held at Mr.
                  Cotes's on the Tuesday morning, when it was known that the grand jury had returned
                  a "true bill" against Emily Somers. The announcement that our case would probably
                  be called on almost immediately, broke up the council, and away we all departed
                  for the court, Mr. Prince, of course, who was in costume, walking up Catharine
                  street with the gravity and decorum which so well becomes the law; I and the
                  lieutenant walked faster.
               "A queer fish," said the anxious and irate artillery officer, "that master of
                  yours: he listened to everybody, it is true, but said nothing himself, nor did
                  anything, for that matter, except rub his nose and forehead now and then."
               "Never mind; wait till it is his cue to speak. I have no fear, unless, indeed,
                  luck should run very contrary."
               The small, inconvenient court was crowded to excess. Mr. Justice Rook presided,
                  and the Earl of Pembroke, with, if I mistake not, the present Earl Radnor, then
                  Lord Folkestone, was on the bench. Immediately a trifling case was disposed of,
                  Emily Somers was brought in and arraigned. A murmur of sympathy and sorrow ran
                  through the crowd at the sad spectacle, in such a position, of one so young, so
                  fair, so beloved,—aye, so beloved, as all could testify who witnessed the
                  frightful emotion depicted in Lieutenant Wyndham's countenance when the prisoner
                  was placed in the dock. It was a speechless agony, and so violent, that I and the
                  Reverend Mr. Ridgway caught hold of his arms and endeavored to force him out of
                  the court. He resisted desperately; a deep sob at last gave vent to the strangling
                  emotion which convulsed him, and he became comparatively calm. The leading counsel
                  for the prosecution,—there was a tremendous bar against us, as if that could
                  avail!—opened the case very temperately, and the witnesses, previously at the
                  request of Mr. Prince ordered out of court, were called seriatim. The first were servants, who merely proved the finding of
                  the necklace, as before described, and Miss Somers's anxiety to be gone before the
                  chaise arrived; they were not cross-examined. Charlotte Gilbert was next called.
                  At the mention of this name the crowd undulated, so to speak; a wave seemed to
                  pass over the sea of heads, and all eyes were eagerly, the great majority angrily,
                  bent upon the person of a lady about fifty years of age, splendidly attired in
                  satin mourning. She was a fine woman, and ordinarily, I should have supposed, of
                  imperious, commanding aspect and presence, but not now: she had, it was clear to
                  me, undertaken a task beyond her strength, and every fibre in my body pulsated
                  with anticipated triumph.
               She answered, however, the few questions put to her by the prosecuting counsel
                  distinctly, though in a low tone, and without raising her eyes. The necklace
                  produced was hers, and she had seen it
                  found in the prisoner's muff et cetera. Mr.
                  Prince rose amidst the profoundest silence; "Will you have the kindness, Mrs.
                  Gilbert, to look at me?" he said. The witness raised her eyes for a moment, but
                  utterly unable to sustain his gaze, they were instantly cast down again.
               "Well, never mind, we must excuse you; but listen, at all events. The letters
                  addressed to Lieutenant Wyndham and the Rev. Mr. Ridgway, which you purloined the
                  day before Mr. Hurdley died,—where are they?"
               A faint bubbling scream, she vainly strove to entirely repress, broke from the
                  quivering lips of the witness. "The letters!" she feebly gasped.
               "Aye, the letters informing those gentlemen that Emily Somers was in truth Emily
                  Hurdley, and the legitimate heiress to the writer's wealth."
               There was no attempt to answer, and Mrs. Gilbert clutched tightly at the front of
                  the witness-box. "Your witness is fainting," said Mr. Prince to the counsel for
                  the prosecution; "has no one a smelling-bottle?" One was found, and the terrified
                  woman appeared to partially revive. The cross-examination was resumed.
               "When you placed the diamond necklace in the prisoner's muff, you—"
               A piercing shriek interrupted Mr. Prince, and when we looked again towards the
                  witness-box, it seemed empty,—Mrs. Gilbert had fallen, utterly insensible, on the
                  floor. She was borne out of court, and Mr. Prince addressing the opposite side,
                  said in his blandest tone, "You had better, perhaps, call another witness; the
                  lady may presently recover." This was acceded to, and the name of Charles Gilbert
                  was bawled out once—twice—thrice. The attorney for the prosecution left the court
                  to seek for the unanswering Charles Gilbert. He had been gone a considerable time,
                  and the judge was becoming impatient, when he re-entered, looking very pale and
                  agitated. "My lord," he said, "the prosecution is abandoned! Mrs. Gilbert and her
                  son have driven off in their carriage."
               The tempestuous hubbub that followed this announcement, the exclamations in a
                  contrary sense,—maledictions on the prosecutrix, congratulations of the
                  accused,—could not be for some time repressed. At length order was restored, a
                     quasi explanation ensued between counsel, and
                  Mr. Justice Rooke, turning towards the jury, said, "I conclude that after what we
                  have just witnessed and heard, there can be no doubt of what your verdict will
                  be." An acquittal was instantly pronounced by acclamation; the triumphant shouts
                  of the audience were renewed, and I could just distinguish through tears that
                  almost blinded me, Emily Somers carried off in the rapturous embrace of Lieutenant
                  Wyndham.
               "You and Mr. Cotes," said Mr. Prince, as soon as I could listen to him, "must
                  instantly follow to Hurdley Villa; there is important work to be done yet." There
                  was, no doubt, but it was easily performed. Utterly panic-stricken, bargaining
                  only for personal safety, Mrs. Gilbert and her son gave us all the information,
                  acquired by them from the purloined explanatory letters, which was necessary to
                  establish the legitimacy of Emily Somers,—properly Emily Hurdley; and a joyous
                  triumphant finale concluded the at-one-time
                  menacing and troubled drama I have, I fear, very imperfectly depicted.
            
            
               
               The Golden Guillotine.
               I PASSED part of the year 1824, and nearly the whole of 1825, in France. I was
                  then more than a boy, though not quite a man—that is, I was able to observe
                  everything, without having attained the full power of reasoning upon what I saw.
                  Above all, my memory was more retentive than it has ever been since, for I have
                  remarked that the pictures drawn upon the retina of the mind do not become
                  fastened by after processes. As they first impinge, so they remain, all the more
                  distinctly and permanently from having been traced upon a delicate and virgin
                  surface. Youth employs itself little with the images it stores within its memory.
                  They are kept for after use—a use that wears them out.
               One over-clouded afternoon, having just had my fencing lesson, and finding it
                  quite impossible to remain within doors any longer without getting hopelessly into
                  the blue devils, I sallied forth into the street of Tours (the town in which we
                  then resided), without any very definite idea of the next thing to be done. There
                  were two ways, of course, to choose between—one to the left, up the Faubourg, past
                     theFabrique de Passementerie, the Pension, and the ancient stone, on which was inscribed
                  the record of some ancient inundation of the Loire, "jusqu' ici," stopped by the visible interposition of St. Anthony.
                  But, then, in that direction lay the abattoir,
                  and the bare idea of a sanguine gush from within the archway and down the kennel
                  whilst I was traversing its brink, was enough to decide me. I turned to the
                  right.
               This led me to the more ancient parts of the town, and the congenial vicinity of
                  the great Cathedral of St. Gatien. The echoes of the deep bells swept over the
                  roofs of the houses, and chimed in with the sombre tone of my contemplations. At a
                  particular break in this ridge of roofs, I caught a sight of the massive towers,
                  staring over ominously upon me from the region of tempest, while two or three
                  ravens seemed to be blown out of them ever and anon by the gusts, slowly and
                  perseveringly returning with each lull to the shelter of the ragged tracery near
                  their summits, and forcibly reminding me of those evil thoughts which, when
                  expelled, return again and again to find shelter in some rent of our ruined
                  organization. It was not without a certain sensation of awe that I found myself
                  thus under the archiepiscopal shadow, for I had learned thus early to succumb to
                  the genius of great structures, and to suffer myself to be bestridden by these
                  dark embodiments of mediæval influences.
               Suddenly I observed indications of the avenue coming to an end. Grass started
                  greenly between the stones, and the street appeared untrodden by man or beast. A
                  few steps further, and a heavy gate stood opposite me, under the skeletons of
                  large timber trees, barring all further advance. I now cast about me for some
                  means of exit, other than by retracing my steps, which somehow or other conveyed
                  to me a sense of humiliation; and I did contrive to make out at the right a low archway, through which a paved
                  alley sharply descended, I knew not whither, but apparently a public thoroughfare.
                  Down this, after a moment's hesitation, I plunged, and found myself, as soon as I
                  had emerged into the light at the rear of the buildings, in a deserted plot, which
                  seemed to stretch away in one direction, comfortless and grass-grown, nearly to
                  the inner face of the town walls.
               Long as I had resided in Tours, I had never seen or heard of this place. Where was
                  I?—what was it? I determined to find out. Besides, it was sheltered from the wind,
                  which was getting keener every moment, as the short day began to close in. I knew
                  not what it was that urged me on, but I felt a forward impulse, and followed the
                  path for some distance, until a slight bend removed altogether from my view both
                  the buildings I had left behind, and the distant town wall, and brought me to the
                  foot of an ancient terrace.
               The solitude was impressive. The storm, which roared among the leafless great
                  trees on the terrace overhead, as through the cordage of a ship, could not get
                  down to where I was, except in an occasional gust and eddy, striking a bare branch
                  against a bare stone, as if bent on killing what the winter had robbed; and the
                  soft, moist black loam about me I could fancy to partake of the genius of the
                  place, and derive its richness from accumulated relics of mortality.
               Here I paused, marvelling at the Cyclopean proportions of the stones of which the
                  terrace wall was composed. Surely, said I, they were giants who fashioned and put
                  together these huge masses! But what is this? Why, the terrace looks as if it was
                  undermined?
               This exclamation was forced from me by my coming suddenly upon a breach, similar
                  to what the waves sometimes make in a sea-wall—that is, the lower courses for some
                  distance appeared to have been removed outwards, the upper remaining hanging
                  together by their own weight, so as to give a cavelike appearance to the
                  aperture.
               I had not time, however, to speculate upon the cause of what I saw, for at that
                  instant I perceived, just within the shadow of the opening, the figure of a man
                  kneeling. There is always something startling in stumbling upon the hidden
                  devotions of another. If you add to this, in the stranger's appearance, a stern
                  melancholy of countenance spread over the rigid prominence of protruding bones,
                  scarcely covered by the sallow flesh, and the peculiar expression of eyes, the
                  balls of which seemed, instead of swelling outwards, to hollow inwards, as you
                  look into a rock crystal, some idea of my first sensations may be realized. I felt
                  my heart throb, and drew a step back, in hopes I had not been observed; but the
                  stranger, without turning his eyes in the direction in which I stood, bent towards
                  the sound, and held up one hand, with a motion which seemed to warn me not to go,
                  as well as not to advance.
               I obeyed, as if under the spell of a mesmerizer, and stood there for three or four
                  minutes, during which the great bells of the cathedral came down upon us ever and
                  anon, like puffs of smoke. They were, I now for the first time remarked, tolling
                  solemnly—a mournful peal. Presently they ceased; and then the stranger rose, and
                  came out into the entrance of the grotto, towards me. I bowed respectfully, and,
                  in such French as I could muster, apologized for having intruded, however
                  unconsciously, upon his devotions. I now saw that that peculiar expressionless
                  look I had at first remarked could give place to a more searching one. He drew his
                  eyes, as it were, to a focus by an instantaneous effort, and set them burning upon
                  me like a lens; then again retracted them within himself and said, calmly, and
                  almost mournfully—
               
               "The archbishop died an hour ago. I had a prayer to say for his soul as well as
                  the rest. They prayed before the High Altar—I before Heaven. Where should I pray
                  but here?"
               "You knew him, perhaps?" I rejoined, scarcely knowing what to say.
               "I have known many people, young man. It is not for that alone I knelt under this
                  ruin. But come, sit down here; you, I see, are a stranger—so am I, though a
                  Frenchman. We have thus a bond between us. You are young—I am old. That, too, is a
                  bond. You are guiltless of the last century. Sit down—we can have a word with each
                  other."
               The quiet self-possession with which he addressed me, an utter stranger, surprised
                  me. I could only account for it as the result of that one intense, concentrated
                  gaze, by which I fancied he had satisfied himself as to my character. But such a
                  man, so nervous, energetic, and decided, must be of no common stamp. Indeed, young
                  and inexperienced as I was, I scarcely needed more than a moment to read thus
                  much.
               Whatever it was—whether fear or confidence, or the youthful love of adventure that
                  prevailed with me, I made no demur, but seated myself beside him upon one of the
                  blocks of stone.
               "Let us know each other a little better," said he, "and we shall be more at our
                  ease. I ask no particulars of you. I will not hear them; for you are
                  too young to be master of your own secrets. All I required, I have discovered.
                     You are English. Had I not been satisfied of this, do not suppose
                  you would have been sitting here, now!"
               "Well. I am."
               "Enough. My name you may set down as Jean François Lenoir. I have seen many
                  strange things in my day, young man. Aye, and picked up odd relics from the past,
                  as a man who digs in the bed of a stream will come upon coins, and potsherds, and
                  bones. Here is one, now, so out-of-the-way, that I always carry it about me."
               So saying, he held up before me a small gold ornament, apparently designed for the
                  neck; but which, to my inexpressible horror, I perceived at once to be fashioned
                  into the shape of a guillotine! I started up—and
                  he rose too; but, instead of entering into an explanation, he stepped over to me,
                  and taking my hand, led me to the light at the entrance of the grotto, then,
                  holding the ornament so as to exhibit the reverse side, bid me read the
                  inscription there written. It was this— 
                     
                        La tete tombe, le coeur reste.
                     
                  
               
               As I read, he looked me steadily in the face; and, as soon as I had pronounced the
                  words, he led me back to my seat, and, placing himself once more beside me,
                  said:—
               "Now, I have given you the key to my history. Hearken unto it, for it contains
                  instruction:—
               On the 20th of October, in the year 1793, I was conducted a prisoner to the Palace
                  of the Luxembourg. They had accused me of the crimes of being rich, noble, and a
                  royalist. My estates having been forfeited, I had been arrested in the provinces,
                  and was now brought up, along with several prisoners of inferior rank, to Paris.
                  As the gate of the Luxembourg closed after me, I resigned all hope of liberation,
                  except by one exit—the scaffold; and secretly determined to seek, if I could, the
                  most solitary recesses of the prison, there to remain shut up with my own thoughts
                  until my time should arrive for removal to the Conciergerie, and execution. I
                  trusted to what ready money I had the command of for the means of obtaining this
                  indulgence—for the time had now come
                  when the system of rapiotage had been organized,
                  under which every one of the better class was robbed on entering the
                  prison-gate.
               The first person I saw, amidst the crowd who thronged round the wicket, anxious to
                  catch a glimpse of their fellow-sufferers, was Pierre Levasseur, a travelling
                  companion of mine in former years, and afterwards an occasional associate, until
                  something incompatible in our positions in society (for he had not the cent années), and then the stormy scenes of the
                  Revolution, had parted us, and I lost sight of him. He embraced me with the utmost
                  demonstrations of affection, and, taking me by the hand, led me a little apart,
                  and told me that having been some time an inmate of the prison, he could be of
                  great service in introducing me to its customs as well as to its inhabitants, and
                  preventing me making mistakes which might compromise me.
               "But," said I, "I have determined to make no acquaintances here. I have friends
                  enough for the rest of my life, I am sure. If I want to make a last confidence,
                  you are here, my dear Levasseur, and will shrive me."
               "Unless," replied he with a laugh, "I have first to make a confession
                  to you, which, in the order of our arrest, is the most likely
                  thing."
               "And how came you here?" I inquired, suddenly recollecting that he had never
                  appeared to me a very warm royalist, but, on the contrary, avowed himself, when I
                  parted from him two years before, rather inclined to the popular side.
               "Oh, we must not forestall our revelations! We should be at the mercy of each
                  other, you know, if we became confidants here until compelled by
                  necessity. Enough for me to say, in a whisper, that Robespierre fancied my linen
                  was finer than his, and, as we employed the same blanchisseuse, he thought, I presume, that the best way of reducing
                  my fabric to the texture of his own, was to transfer my lingerie to the laveuses of
                  Luxembourg."
               "The same extravagant drôle as ever!" I
                  exclaimed, recognising the esprit railleur I had
                  so often observed and rebuked. "Take care that your nonsense does not get you into
                  a scrape. I am told that there are eyes and ears busy hereabouts"—
               "Hush! I know it; but I know, too, that the best way of disarming suspicion, is to
                  be frank, careless, and jovial. Do you think, now," continued he, lowering his
                  voice to a distinct whisper, at the same time putting his mouth so close to my
                  ear, that he had to lift up my hair for the purpose—"do you think that you could
                  form any guess amongst the persons about us, as to that character we are all so
                  much in dread of—the agent of the police?"
               "I don't know," replied I, venturing a stealthy look round me, which I instantly
                  withdrew, adding—"Is it safe to scrutinize people? You confirm my suspicions as to
                  our being watched."
               "Scarcely safe, I believe," he replied; "but they have a few marks,
                  nevertheless. For instance, when you see a man sitting gloomily apart, avoiding
                  much converse with the prisoners, and noticing neither the motions nor the
                  conversation of the groups which pass him by, you may be pretty sure that that man
                  is a spy of Fouquier's. Upon such a fellow as me, now, they have an uncommonly
                  sharp eye; but I laugh at them, and they can make nothing of me. Whatever evidence
                  exists against me outside, they shall add nothing to it here, I
                  promise you. You must act as I do, my dear friend. Come into society (for we have
                  our society here); address every one, get all you can out of them; make your own
                  observations in silence, and if you want to pass remarks, come to me. Ten to one,
                  my superior knowledge of character, gained here at the foot of the scaffold, which strips off all masks, will
                  stand you in stead. And now, remember, there is a select reunion this very evening
                  in the Salle des Pleurs, as we have named it. A few of the better order, as it
                  used to be called—you know what that means—meet there, so I will
                  direct (request, I beg his pardon) my peculiar little turnkey to summons you to
                  that apartment at the usual hour, and there you will meet me, and some others of
                  the missing aristocracy of France!"
               I was amazed at the levity of Levasseur under such circumstances; still, I was
                  young myself, naturally high-spirited, and was greatly re-assured by meeting an
                  old acquaintance where I had so little expected it; so, after a moment's
                  hesitation, I abandoned my original design, and surrendered myself to my friend's
                  invitation.
               As soon as we had separated, however, my mind relapsed into despondency. The
                  execution of Marie Antoinette had taken place only a few days before. When I first
                  heard of it, my soul had boiled over with vengeance, but by this time its effect
                  was only to aggravate and deepen my dejection. Besides, the terrible reality of my
                  situation forced itself upon me through every chink of my senses. It was now that
                  I felt, for the first time, the iron of captivity enter into my soul. Pallid and
                  emaciated faces peered spectrally into mine, as if they envied me the flush of
                  health I had borne in among them from the world without, and could not
                  communicate. A confused wrangling, consequent on overcrowded accommodation,
                  incessantly met my ears; a contention in which every loftier feeling proper to man
                  as a member of society, gives way to the one grovelling instinct of self,
                  degrading his high humanity down to the level of the brutes. The forced
                  intermixure of ranks and grades, previously dissociated by a natural arrangement
                  assented to on both sides, displayed its effects in fierce and humiliating liating
                  collisions, in which the great social drama of the Revolution was enacted on a
                  small and mean scale under my eyes. I might easily enter into detail. Here and
                  there a group lay apart, unconscious, apparently, of the terrible tumult around.
                  The messenger of death had come to these—had taken one, or two, or more away to
                  the Conciergerie, never to be heard of more. I saw one man, who seemed to be the
                  survivor of a family; for even the wretches expecting their own fate, pitied him.
                  He sat still, in a ray of sunshine, a thing which the full blaze of day was
                  powerless to resuscitate.—But why torture you with all this? It is past—and here
                  am I.
               Evening came, and, instead of the turnkey, appeared Levasseur himself. He
                  suspected I might make excuses, or be unable to muster my spirits, and determined,
                  he said, to use his own influence. I saw it was useless to resist; so I rose from
                  my seat, leaned on his arm, and passed along the corridor to the Salle des
                  Pleurs.
               I entered; and found myself in an ill-lighted but spacious hall, furnished with
                  some rude chairs, tables, and benches, in which were already assembled probably
                  more than one hundred persons. It was at once perceptible that here, though a
                  prisoner, I was in elevated society. The eye of one accustomed to mix with the
                  world detects, almost at a glance, and under any disguise, the grade of the
                  company it surveys. Besides, mine was not wanting in quickness, and at that time,
                  though uninstructed as yet, possessed in full vigor those natural powers it
                  learned afterwards to turn to better account. I saw that, in spite of those dim
                  lamps, and iron bars, and rude benches, I stood amongst the nobility of France,
                  and like a true aristocrat, my heart and courage instantly bounded within me. I
                  felt that amidst the convulsion of society it was still permitted me to associate
                  with the ancient blood of an ancient
                  kingdom, and I scarcely cared even though I were to suffer the penalty of having
                  its current flowing through my veins, so I were permitted to the last to enjoy the
                  exquisite privileges its participation afforded me.
               "But, M. Lenoir," interrupted I, "you had not previously informed me of your being
                  noble?"
               "Nor had I intended to do so," replied he, after a moment's pause, drawing a long
                  breath, as the strain was taken off his memory; "you have made an unconscious
                  discovery amidst my revelations. Few older families existed even then—none exist
                  now within the kingdom—than the Vicomtes de Martigny, of which I was the sole
                  representative."
               "De Martigny!" cried I. "Why, they belonged to this very province!"
               "To this spot, almost," he replied. "Their estates were bounded on two sides by
                  the walls of Tours, and extended across to the lordship of Montbazon. But what of
                  that? They are gone; and he who might have transmitted them, he, too, will go; and
                  with him, the last claimant who could have recovered them. I stand here, the sole
                  survivor of my race!"
               I looked with a degree of reverence upon this solitary representative of a long
                  line of nobles, many anecdotes relating to whom I had heard during my residence in
                  Tours, and who were always spoken of as the Grands
                     Seigneurs of the district.
               "Let me ask a question," said I, "arising out of your disclosures. How comes it
                  that you live alone, under an assumed name, and yet remain here,
                  where you are likely to be most easily recognised?"
               "You will understand the reason before I have done. My immediate object in living
                  as I do, and in renouncing my proper title, is to elude the curiosity and the
                  kindness of those who have nothing to discover which I would not keep concealed,
                  and can offer no consolation that could repair the past."
               I entered the Hall of Tears (as with a ghastly conceit they named their place of
                  meeting), and was recognised by more than one of the personages assembled there.
                  Woe was imprinted on the visages of many of these; a reckless hilarity lighted up
                  the countenances of a few of the younger men, but most of them retained their
                  ordinary cheerfulness and vivacity unimpaired and unexaggerated; and all, without
                  exception, appeared to preserve the lofty and chivalrous demeanor which might be
                  deemed hereditary in their families, and had, at all events, become a second
                  nature. For me to have appeared otherwise than myself in such a society, would
                  have been derogatory to my pretensions—so in a few moments I fell in with the
                  spirit of the assemblage, and, shutting my eyes to the gloomy accessories, strove
                  to imagine myself once more in one of the salons
                  of the Faubourg St. Germaine.
               What struck me as most singular, though in keeping with the name of this hall,
                  was, that many of the ladies wore as ornaments, either on their heads, round their
                  necks, or on their bosoms, pieces of jewellery significant in their forms of the
                  horrors that surrounded and awaited them. One exhibited a chain and padlock
                  bracelet, another a dagger through her hair, and a third a skull and cross-bones
                  as a brooch. A shudder ran through me as I observed this grim pleasantry
                  associated with death; and though I learned at last to look upon these emblems
                  with indifference—nay, with something less than indifference, as you shall
                  hear—yet it took some time to reconcile me to the fashion.
               Levasseur stuck close to my elbow, and watched the effect of what I witnessed, as
                  it depicted itself upon my countenance. He gave me credit more than once for my steadiness of nerve under circumstances
                  so trying and so novel, and at the same time satisfied my curiosity, every now and
                  then, by recounting anecdotes and incidents relating to the more remarkable of the
                  personages who approached and receded from us.
               "There: do you see that reserved, downcast-looking body, with the tonsure of a
                  monk only half overgrown by the locks of a sans-culotte? He seems to think that society is a mistake, now that
                  it is likely to lose him so soon. That is the cidevant Abbé Fauchet, who will probably remove his gravity from
                  hence to the Conciergerie in a day or two. He figures, you know, among the
                  Girondin worthies who seem so indignant that their turn should come at last for
                  the guillotine."
               "What! a Girondin?" exclaimed I; "are they actually in the room?"
               "To be sure. The noblesse admits them on the score of their youth and approaching
                  dissolution. See, here we have another of them, for they are gregarious. He is
                  hobbling up on his crutches to cheer up Fauchet. That is Sillery; a jolly dog to
                  the last."
               "Where is Vergniaud?" I whispered, unable to repress the interest I felt in the
                  theme of all tongues.
               "We must go further up the room to reach him," replied Levasseur. "He and Ducos
                  have contrived to excite pretty nearly as violent a fureur amongst the grandes dames
                  as they formerly did chez les dames de la halle;
                  and never can manage to get, even in prison, a moment's peace, or what
                     they would call peace; that is, solitude."
               I could scarcely refrain from a smile at this wild travesty of the classic
                  sentiment, and advanced into the hall until I reached the circle, in the midst of
                  which stood Vergniaud, Ducos, and Fonfréde. For a moment I could not help feeling
                  a flush of triumph at seeing these firebrands themselves the victims of their own
                  exterminating frenzy. The next, I stood spell-bound like the rest, listening to
                  such a flow of eloquence from the lips of the principal speaker as no experience
                  of my life had ever prepared me for. It was not the excited extravagance of mere
                  declamation you so often listen to, full of florid luxuriance upon a dead level,
                  like a tropical forest. Vergniaud spoke like a philosopher and a man of the world
                  as well as an orator. Every exalted theme he discussed by turns; and when the
                  poetic youth, Ducos, illustrating the subject Vergniaud had last touched
                  upon—namely, the miseries of France and the unhappy dangers into which young and
                  gifted spirits had been drawn by their patriotism—uttered, with the fervor of a
                  martyr, that fine sentiment of Corneille's— 
                     La plus douce esperance est de perdre l'espoir,
                   the eye of the speaker bent upon him with an expression of sympathizing
                  affection, which seemed to go to the hearts of the listening group around, and
                  certainly disarmed mine for the moment of some of its prejudices.
               "Come, come," cried Levasseur, jogging my elbow, "it will not do to have you
                  embrace the Gironde contre cœur. Were Madame
                  Roland here to-night, indeed, there might be some excuse for you. She, alas! has
                  taken a most extraordinary and unaccountable aversion to me, do you know; and,
                  when I appear here, seldom honors us with her presence. But see, away goes
                  Vergniaud turning on his heel, and after him sails that most aristocratic
                  provincial neighbor of yours, the Marquise de la Cour Cheverny, in a flood of
                  ancestral tears. Young Montmorenci follows her, with a vinaigrette and heart at
                  her service. Ah! you see, Vicompte, they cannot bar the Faubourg out, after
                  all!"
               
               Here Levasseur laughed softly, with the discreet hilarity of an habitué of these prison festivities.
               "Levasseur! Levasseur! be serious, I entreat of you. This is not the place for
                  such levity!"
               My remonstrance was prompted by the entrance of two persons.
               One of them was an elderly lady, the other a young one. As soon as they had
                  entered, an ecclesiastic, of dignified demeanor, whose face I did not see at the
                  time, but who seemed to have been expecting them, moved over towards them, as if
                  to afford them the protection their sex and unprotected condition had need of in
                  such an assemblage as this.
               They were dressed differently from the rest of the company, who most of them
                  contrived still to adorn themselves in what might be called, by courtesy, the
                  fashion of the day, even as far as paint, patches, and powder, to say nothing of
                  the ominous jewellery they wore. A sepulchral simplicity marked these ladies. The
                  elder wore a plain grey robe, and a plain cap covering her grey locks. The younger
                  was in spotless white, with an extraordinary weight of what is called black hair,
                  but which in northern nations is more frequently dark brown, drawn away from her
                  brow, and falling in shadows of lustrous intricacy upon her neck and shoulders. It
                  would be a vain task to describe her face. At the time, I could not have even made
                  the attempt; and if I afterwards knew her marble complexion and Grecian features
                  by heart, it was in that moment but a wonderful and radiant embodiment of
                  loveliness that I saw, penetrating without definite outlines the tissues of my
                  imagination. At the instant she entered, a rich voice from amongst the company was
                  just giving the minor motif of the then favorite
                  aria by Glück, "Che faro;" and that form, to my
                  excited fancy, seemed to start out of the melody, as if born of grief and
                  loneliness; so that when the strain ended, I expected to see her, too, vanish with
                  the song, and leave memory like an echo ringing in my heart. It was not till the
                  sounds had been lost in the deepening hum of voices that I could utter—
               "My friend—who—what are these?"
               "I knew you would be on wires as soon as Alphonsine entered," exclaimed my
                  companion, without fully answering my question. "She has turned our heads here
                  already, and must, if she has a fair trial, soften the heart even of the great
                  Rhadamanthus of the Hotel de Ville."
               I felt this levity to be more than out of place—to be revolting. Still, I must
                  not, I knew, judge the unhappy throng around me by the rules of a world from which
                  they were, most of them, for ever shut out. Accordingly, I contented myself with
                  repeating my question.
               "These are aunt and niece," replied he. "Noble and all that—the St. Lucs. The
                  elder lady's husband, Alphonsine's uncle, has already had his last promenade upon
                  the fatal cart. These two are charged with 'complicité,' and when their turns come
                  will, no doubt, follow in procession, unless they have better success than
                  Custine's daughter. Meanwhile, let us make the most of them. They lend salt to our
                     'pleurs,' and do all that mortals—or
                  immortals—can to reconcile us to iron bars and stone walls. You must not be known
                  not to know them. Come along, the archbishop must give place for this once."
               So saying, and without affording me time to collect my thoughts, he dragged me by
                  the arm up to the ladies, who seemed already to have gathered a respectful and
                  sympathizing circle about them. He made his obeisance with a deferential courtesy,
                  strangely contrasted—to me, who had just heard the remarks he had made—with his
                  true sentiments; and was proceeding to introduce me, when just at that moment I caught a glimpse of the clergyman
                  that had at first joined them, and, to my surprise, discovered him to be the
                  archbishop of the province to which I belonged, the excellent and loyal M. de
                  Montblanc. Our mutual recognition was at once pleasurable and painful. I threw
                  myself at his feet, and the excellent prelate shed tears over my youthful
                  captivity. When I raised myself up, I observed the eyes of the younger of the two
                  ladies resting upon me with a mournful expression, and turning towards Levasseur,
                  saw upon his countenance the last traces of a smile, which he had not intended to
                  have left lingering there so long. As it was, he took my hand, and gallantly
                  kneeling before the two ladies, presented with an extravagance of gesture, looking
                  very like a caricature of the ancien régime,
                  Citoyen le Vicomte de Martigny!
               The archbishop seized my other hand, and without seeming to notice the
                  overstrained acting of my companion, spoke my name over again, adding some words
                  of delicate commendation—dictated, I felt, more by his kindness, and the interest
                  he had evinced in my family, than by any deserts of mine.
               I look back with astonishment at the intensity of the glow which I felt pervading
                  my whole soul—at the magnificence of the conflagration kindled within me by the
                  consciousness felt at the instant and in its full energy, that now, at the portals
                  of the grave, as it were, I had for the first time met with the fulfilment of my
                  destiny, the substance of that shadow of love my whole previous life had been one
                  vain pursuit of. It is possible, young man, that no human being in a less
                  desperate emergency could have all the aspirations of his nature so completely and
                  instantaneously embodied before him. Life was condensed, as we believed, from
                  years into hours. The world was compressed within the boundaries of our prison.
                  Our career was to be accomplished in a few actions, for which we scarcely had
                  time. Our destiny was cooped up in a few fierce feelings, crowding to rend their
                  barriers within our breasts. I received the image before me into my heart as a
                  revelation from heaven—a great light, which I only knew to be light, too dazzling
                  for me to look at. It passed in, blinding me on its way. I could scarcely say what
                  it was I worshipped.
               This powerful heart-stroke carried with it the reciprocating conviction which
                  alone could make the sensation endurable. I felt that the shock was mutual—that
                  the electric current of passion could not rend one bosom so completely, without a
                  corresponding rift in the other. To have doubted this would have been death. And,
                  as after knowledge showed me that these subtle influences, while they transcend
                  reason, act in strict conformity with it, so now, in very truth, I had divined
                  aright in the midst of my bewilderment. Oh, mighty force of one master passion!
                  Terrific and fatal power, which lightens and blasts at the same moment, according
                  to what inscrutable law are thy thunderbolts turned loose amongst mankind! To what
                  end was it, mighty Creator! if not to vindicate thy superseded worship, that the
                  swift and merciful axe cut off the authors of our woes, while upon us was wreaked
                  the slow vengeance which has cast her bones here, and
                  still binds me fast to life, like a malefactor chained to the oar
                  which strains without liberating him!
               The wretched man, as he alluded to the fate of the woman appearing to be thus
                  idolized, had seized my arm, and when he shrieked the word "here,"
                  pointed with his skinny finger to the ground at our feet—which caused me to start
                  up—but the next moment set me upon endeavoring, in the midst of my excitement, to
                  form some conjecture as to the cause of his haunting this spot, coupling what he
                  had now uttered with some expressions used previously. I immediately perceived, however, that there was not
                  enough revealed as yet to justify any plausible surmise, so I turned once more in
                  the attitude of anxious attention towards the exhausted narrator, on whose
                  forehead big drops of sweat stood out.
               Let us hasten on, my son. Hasten as I may, I cannot make my relations as rapidly
                  as time flew. Nearly four months had gone over our heads as prisoners in the
                  Luxembourg, and still, though the Angel of Death entered those gloomy dungeons day
                  after day, laying his fingers of blood upon victim after victim right and left of
                  us, upon our shoulders his touch had not yet descended. We had survived, as it
                  seemed to us, whole generations of mankind. From the young and gifted Girondins,
                  and the regicide Orleans, to the very turnkeys themselves, all had been swept off
                  to the guillotine, and new victims and new gaolers were still brought in to pass
                  their probation for the scaffold. The festivities which we had affected to make a
                  microcosm of the precincts of our prison-house, had died with the projectors of
                  them. To us, and with new comers, it became flat and wearisome, this attempt to
                  re-enact gaieties which only reminded us of our losses. In the Conciergerie, it is
                  true, those who had been brought so far on their way to the grave still made wild
                  sport of their last hours, in the dead of each night rehearsing the ghastly
                  tragedy they were to perform on the morrow. Suppressed laughter floated through
                  the empty corridors, and troubled the sleep of the conscience-ridden gaolers,
                  making them lie closer, as they half believed that the ghosts of headless tenants
                  were rejoicing at the ample repasts preparing for the tomb they had descended
                  into. But here we had neither hope nor despair enough for such things. Life for us
                  had become a dream—a sepulchral shadow, under which silence alone flourished. The
                  discipline having become stricter, we could not, indeed, have indulged in all the
                  relaxations once open to us; but the stringency of their rules was an unnecessary
                  severity. Our spirits had descended to the level of their requisitions before ever
                  they had been devised.
               A question, I know, by this time suggests itself to you—how did all this act upon
                  the feelings and affections of two individuals thrown together as spectators of
                  such horrors! A curious speculation, no doubt. It was the fire mighty to separate
                  the gold from the dross. We bore the test. Happiness hovered over us both like a
                  commiserating angel, not quite daring to alight upon us, but without once winging
                  its way out of sight. To me no period of life, before or since, has equalled that
                  in felicity. For her, I believe, I may answer with equal confidence. If the
                  chamber of life was dark and vaulted, there was a window through which each could
                  look into a world, and deem it its own. The barriers which shut out heaven and
                  earth, had left to us our eyes, and left us together. Into these luminaries we
                  looked for light, and saw in them perspectives, heights, depths, distances,
                  glories, sufficient for the amplest aspirations of two beings like us joined,
                  fused now, in the furnace of adversity, into one. We had sworn upon a token I had
                  given her—one devised in accordance with the spirit of the strange and
                  half-sepulchral world we lived in—the token I have already exhibited to you—to be
                  true to each other until divided by its stroke. The vow was intended to strengthen
                  our hearts, and fortify them against the worst fate we apprehended—though not the
                  worst that awaited us. I had no hope, no wish, no thought, beyond where I was. She
                  pastured upon my looks; and though her paleness had become mortal, her flush
                  hectic, and the gleam of her eyes meteoric, nothing boded that she was not
                  blessed, and might not be immortal in her present condition.
               The demeanor of Levasseur during the period we have come to, was puzzling. He made friends and
                  intimates on all sides, and succeeded, by his appearance of sympathy and the
                  pliancy of his character, in gaining the confidence of those most opposed to each
                  other in station and opinion. He was always occupied, if not in the large common
                  apartments, in the more secluded parts of the palace; and the very turnkeys
                  appeared to exhibit towards him a deference which they refused to more exalted
                  personages. As fresh arrests took place, the new comers found in him a ready and
                  instant sympathizer, and when at last the summons of death came (for such
                  everybody felt the removal to the Conciergerie to be), he took leave of the
                  departing wretches with every demonstration of commiseration, frequently remarking
                  to us how bitter a drop it was in the cup of his captivity that so many of those
                  with whom he had formed the closest intimacy, were amongst the number thus
                  selected for sacrifice. It became a common topic, indeed, with the survivors, this
                  ill-omened peculiarity respecting him; and we should have been more ready,
                  perhaps, under some superstitious feeling, to dissociate ourselves from his
                  society, but for the dread that was uppermost with us all of having it supposed,
                  by any withdrawal from each other, that we might be classed with those retiring
                  and morose individuals whom he had himself taught us to suspect of being
                  implicated with the police in their system of espionage.
               Alphonsine alone manifested a reserve towards Levasseur. I could not comprehend
                  this; and occasionally rallied him about it. He turned off the subject with a
                  laugh; and only redoubled his assiduities in his usual sarcastic style, which won
                  upon so many and amused all. As for me, I kept nothing from him—my heart was as
                  open as the sun to his gaze.
               The 10th of February, 1794, was the day fixed upon for our
                  flight—yes, that was a thing arranged. Her aunt Madame de St.
                  Luc, and the archbishop were to accompany us. Levasseur was to remain; but told us
                  he had reason to calculate upon following us ere long. It is unnecessary to tell
                  you how all this was brought about. Our names seemed to have been forgotten in the
                  vast number of later arrests, and day after day they had come, without placing us
                  upon the list of the proscribed. What interest was made for us, it is as little
                  needful that you should hear; you may believe it was powerful—and that it was
                  woman's. With that one woman rested the generosity of the action—with the man whom
                  she influenced, the treachery, if treachery it must be deemed. I am not called
                  upon to tell you wonders unconnected with my own history; but I might well excite
                  your astonishment. Well, let it pass. Had my distempered and gangrened fancy
                  contented itself with accepting the manna from the hand of Providence, without
                  thrusting its own miserable devices between Heaven and its bounty, we might—but
                  who knows? "Ceux qui ont avancé que tout est bien, ont dit
                     une sottise; il fallait dire que tout est aux mieux."
               A fierce hilarity buoyed up my spirits as the day approached. I had difficulty in
                  keeping this under control in the presence of my fellow-prisoners. Alphonsine did
                  not share it. On the contrary, she was grave and pensive, and wept occasionally.
                  She said she had a foreboding that she should never be as happy elsewhere as she
                  had been within the walls of the Luxembourg. It was arranged that we should make
                  our way to Tours, where the archbishop possessed the means of concealing us until
                  better times. We were to be married as soon as we arrived there; or, if this plan
                  should not succeed, so soon as he could procure the material means of solemnizing
                  that sacrament.
               
                  Why was Alphonsine sad?—My mind was feverishly active. The times were
                  wild. Our plan was desperate. Was she TRUE? Shall I try her? It was
                  the suggestion of an instant. Another
                  moment had decided me to put her to the proof. "She would leave happiness in the
                  prison," were her words. Who was remaining behind? Why, of our intimates, only
                  Levasseur. Infernal thought! How had this never occurred to me before? Nothing
                  more likely. He was ever of our party. He would not speak of her. True, she
                  avoided him in my presence, and his very attentions were tinged with something of
                  bitterness. But what of that? The thing was—not plain, perhaps, but
                     probable—probable. I will test him to the quick. He shall
                     aid me in the business himself!
               
               I was sitting in the depth of a window, with my back to the light, leaning against
                  iron bars, pondering these things. Levasseur entered;—I sprang up, and laid a hand
                  upon each of his shoulders—
               "Levasseur, mon garçon, we are off, if all
                  succeeds, tonight, you know."
               "Well! Yes, you are."
               "You are sorry, infernally sorry—eh?"
               "Yes; it will make a difference to me for a time."
               "Oh, I know. Suppose we enliven the scene, to keep up our spirits?"
               "Enliven the scene! How?"
               "Take a lesson from the Conciergerie; enact a drama, or something of the
                  sort."
               "I don't understand you, De Martigny. Don't let the people see you so ébloui, or they will suspect something."
               "Women are not always what they look."
               "Sometimes they are better."
               "Sometimes, Levasseur, sometimes. Old Madame de St. Luc, for instance. Eh?"
               "Quite as good, at all events."
               "Can we be sure of any of them?"
               "You can, I suppose. For myself, I have seen too much of the world to
                  be anything but a sceptic on such points."
               "Then you do not entirely believe in Alphonsine?"
               "Ha, ha! I knew what all this was coming to. A discreet question to put to a
                  friend!"
               "That is the point. I want to try her."
               "Try her!" he exclaimed, disengaging himself from my grasp. "How is that to be
                  done?"
               "Oh, easily. Parbleu! it will be such a famous preparation for the journey! Now,
                     you can help me in this."
               Fool that I was! I might have seen in the sudden introversion of his eyes, so well
                  remembered afterwards, what that man's soul was made of. They drew back, as it
                  were, deep beneath his brows, and glowed with a flickering, suspicious gleam,
                  which he could neither control nor conceal.
               All this I laid at the instant to a distrust of his own powers of assisting me,
                  or, at most, to a momentary unwillingness to implicate himself in any new
                  difficulty or adventure. I gave him time to recover, and lost for ever the golden
                  opportunity of unmasking him.
               "Yes! you can help me. The postern towards the gardens will be opened this night
                  at twelve o'clock by an unknown agent. An outer gate will likewise be unguarded.
                  We have the password. Disguises and places of concealment are prepared. A guide
                  awaits us. I have till midnight to put Alphonsine to the proof. If I let that hour
                  pass I shall never know her—never, Levasseur. Her heart I feel to be
                  my own. Look at me, Levasseur. You know we need not put her affection
                  to the test; but she may not be proof against terror. Muffle yourself in a
                  disguise; touch her on the shoulder, Levasseur, as she passes to her cell; say she must come to the Conciergerie;
                  that if she utters an exclamation or arouses her friends, all must accompany her;
                  that she must, therefore, be silent, and acquiesce. Then tell her
                  that her only chance of evading the horrible fate yawning before her, is by
                  revealing what she knows concerning me—what are my sentiments on
                  public affairs—what intrigues I am party to—and, generally, what secrets I have to
                  divulge. Let this go on, until her inmost heart is probed; and then, and not
                     till then, release her. The trial will be a sharp and terrible one, but
                  it will be final and complete."
               Levasseur hesitated, meditated,—and undertook the task. As for me, I felt a wild
                  elation, agonizing as if my own trial had been at hand, and compounded of I know
                  not what of distrust, excitement, alarm, recklessness, passion, and revenge. Utter
                  confusion was in my breast.
               The scene was fixed for eleven o'clock, after the turnkeys had gone their rounds,
                  and when the galleries were deserted. Young man, I had my own plan within the
                  other. Do not suppose I believed that I should have satisfied myself by leaving
                  the trial in Levasseur's hands. No; I had not informed him of the interior secret,
                  which was, that I should be myself a concealed witness of the seizure and
                     examination of Alphonsine.
               In the shadow of an arched niche some of the prisoners had set up a crucifix of
                  overgrown proportions, before which, in passing to and from their cells, they
                  might stop to offer a hurried prayer. Behind this crucifix the darkness was
                  complete, and, as it was close to the place arranged for the arrest, I ensconced
                  myself there. The only ray, indeed, which reached the spot, struggled from a
                  coarse lamp, hung at a considerable distance in an angle, where it was contrived
                  to throw its feeble light down two diverging galleries. As the moment approached,
                  I trembled all over; the joints of my knees refused their office, my trepidation
                  being increased by the apprehension that my very nervousness might betray my
                  concealment, and frustrate my scheme. Listening for every sound, I heard at a
                  distance the rumbling of the fatal cart, usually arriving at this unobserved hour
                  from the Conciergerie for those wretches who were next to undergo examination
                  before the revolutionary tribunal. Presently it came into the yard, and stopped;
                  and then my ear, rendered acute by the silence and the morbid disturbance of my
                  nerves, became conscious of sounds from distant cells, mumbled whispers of
                  plotting fellow-prisoners, agonized ejaculations of solitary prayer, the moaning
                  hum of disturbed sleep; nay, I even fancied I could catch ever and anon the more
                  remote clank of a chain, as some unhappy wretch in the vaults beneath the palace
                  turned himself round in the darkness. From without, there came to my ear now and
                  then, as if borne upon a breeze, the hushed thunder of the great city, like the
                  premonitory voices of a volcano whose long inactivity is about to have its term at
                  last. By-and-by, an owl blundered against the stonework of the window at the end
                  of the passage and startled me. I had scarcely recovered from this, when I heard a
                  stealthy step approach, and, a little further removed, a light but firm foot-fall
                  following the same direction.
               The stealthy step drew near, stopped close to me, and I could see the outlines of
                  a figure cloaking itself. Scarcely had it time to draw aside when the other came
                  up; and the first, which I had no difficulty in recognising as Levasseur's,
                  suddenly emerged into the middle of the passage, and confronted the advancing
                  figure. A faint shriek issued from the lips of Alphonsine—for it was she; but she
                  immediately recovered herself, and demanded with firmness who barred her
                  passage.
               "One," said Levasseur, disguising his voice with considerable derable skill, "who has your life and death in his
                  hands. Follow me."
               "Not unless forced to do so," said Alphonsine, in a low, agitated whisper. "I know
                  you not—and am passing to my cell."
               "But I know you; and am come to offer you better lodgings—at the Conciergerie.
                  Come, citoyenne, we allow of no leave-takings, and you will not want many changes
                  of raiment. Come along with me, and come quietly—do you hear? The quieter the
                  better, for others as well as yourself."
               "Oh, my God! must I go—alone?"
               "Certainly not, mademoiselle. You can have all your friends along with you. You
                  have only to rouse them up by uproar, a struggle, shrieks, or the like, to place
                  me under the disagreeable necessity of forming a gang of the whole family party,
                  and taking you off together in the tumbril which is waiting for us down below in
                  the court."
               "Hush! I'm silent. Don't breathe a word. If I must go, God's will be done. One
                  prayer before this crucifix, and I am ready."
               "What! And you make so little of it! Do you know whither I am to conduct you?"
               "I know it well. To ignominy, torture, and death. Alone, unfriended, and unheard
                  of, shall the unhappy Alphonsine endure the most terrible of fates. To endure it
                  she will be torn from all that her life holds dear, from those for whom she would
                  suffer a thousand deaths. I know it well. But—breathe not a word; they sleep
                  sound. I will make my prayer with silent lips—then let me depart."
               So saying, she was about to throw herself down at the foot of the cross behind
                  which I stood, when Levasseur, casting off his disguise, seized her in his arms,
                  and exclaimed, in a voice hoarse with suppressed emotion—
               "No, Alphonsine; not for this am I come. Let the divinity of reason within your
                  own heart be favorable, and plead for me. I have much to reveal—of myself and
                  others. Listen to me, who can speak and answer; and turn from that image, before
                  which you might pour forth your supplications for ever without response or succor.
                  Who, think you, has sent me here, to accost and confront you in this lonely
                  cloister? You dare not answer, though I understand your misgivings. The loved,
                  trusted, faultless De Martigny!"
               A faint exclamation burst from the lips of the girl as she drew back from his
                  embrace.
               "Aye, De Martigny. He believes you false; he does not understand you—he never
                  understood you. Selfish even in his predilections, he now seeks to test you in
                  this cruel manner, as much, perhaps, to seek evidence against you, and a plausible
                  excuse for—shall I say?—deserting you"—
               Alphonsine gave signs of faintness, and supported herself against the masonry of
                  the wall. It was too dark for me to see her face, though she was close to me, but
                  I could hear the heart beat.
               "Or, perhaps," continued he, relaxing the strain when it appeared too violent, "it
                  is only levity; though methinks it is a cruel game to play. You are going to run
                  away with him this night—at least so you think. Perhaps he thinks so, too. Is it
                  to happiness you are going? Just reflect upon this scheme. Suppose it never went
                  further. Is it for this man—the man who devised all this torture—is
                     he the one for whom you are prepared to risk so much? I see you
                  pause—you reflect. You have need to do so—far greater need than you imagine.
                  Hearken! do you know me? Have you ever heard for what crime I was
                  thrust in here, or why I have not followed Vergniaud, Madame Roland, and the rest
                  to the guillotine? Ask Fouquier-Tinville who I am. Put the same question to
                  Danton—to Robespierre. Dost thou
                  suppose the rulers of the destinies of France are not represented within these
                  walls? or only represented by gaolers or turnkeys? I have thy life—your
                     lives—in my hand. A turn in this way, and you are safe—a turn in the
                  other, and you are under the bloody axe. He has betrayed you—be
                  mine!"
               "Yours?" feebly ejaculated Alphonsine, scarcely able to stand, or
                  utter the word.
               "Yes—mine. Reassure yourself. Your ridiculous plot I have taken the means of
                  frustrating. It never had a chance of succeeding. Should the attempt be made, and
                  fail, you are all swept to execution. Let it drop. Nothing will happen to your
                  aunt and friends—in short, to him. They will remain here as before;
                  and when peace is proclaimed, they will be free. A short time—a very
                  short time—will show you what stuff he is made of. Come with me. You
                  know that long before this fickle fool appeared amongst us, I was devoted to you.
                  I have never ceased to be at your feet. Yes; through the whole humiliation of this
                  hated rival's courtship, never for an instant did I relinquish my claim upon the
                  heart of Alphonsine. Let her now understand constancy, and reward it."
               "Reward it, sir?"
               "Oh, yes, yes, yes! I have earned something; your reason must tell you so. Come
                  then, fairest, dearest Alphonsine! A word from me is our passport beyond these
                  gloomy walls, into safety and happiness."
               "Begone!" she exclaimed, in a hollow voice, hoarse with indignation, spurning him
                  from her with a gesture I judged to be a blow.
               He staggered back towards the crucifix—and me—I heard, or
                     rather felt, his breast heave with rage.
               "Miserable woman!" he muttered; "think you that the supercilious caprice of a
                  court can find here an appropriate priate field of action? Do you nourish the
                  delusion that heroism, as you may name it, will in these gloomy cloisters preserve
                  the victim an hour from the Barrière du Trone? Humble yourself, woman! not to this
                  stump of idolatry here, but at Levasseur's feet, and implore him not to drag you
                  through the streets by the hair of your head to the guillotine!"
               "Villain! in this hour of anguish and horror, I tell thee that I despise thee more
                  than I hate the sanguinary gang whose spy thou boastest to be. And here I,
                  Alphonsine de St. Luc, knowing I am to die, yet stand prouder, and purer, and more
                  joyful at heart, before the effigy of my crucified Saviour, as the affianced bride
                  of that Charles de Martigny whom thou falsely malignest, than thy masters ever did
                  at the shrine of the Reason their deeds have outraged, and in the face of a heaven
                  that sickens at the blood they have spilt!"
               "Call, then, upon thy God, or upon Charles de Martigny, which thou pleasest, for
                  all other help is in vain."
               "Oh, Charles! oh, God!" cried Alphonsine, as she sprang forward, with the
                  intention, it was evident, of embracing the crucifix. Levasseur threw himself
                  between it and her—and at the same instant my hands were round his throat with so
                  deadly a gripe that he was at once deprived of all power either to utter or to
                  resist. There I held him paralysed—and was about to call Alphonsine by name, when
                  the continuing immobility and rigidity of the figure I clutched, shot a sudden
                  conviction into my mind—and I was silent. Agitation, and darkness, and meditated
                  crime, make a man susceptible of any extravagant impression. Circumstances
                  afterwards gave strong corroboration to the judgment formed at that instant.
                     I was satisfied that Levasseur believed himself to have been seized by
                     the figure on the cross!
               
               
               Had I addressed Alphonsine, indeed, my words would have fallen upon unhearing
                  ears. She had dropped senseless to the floor.
               I now ventured to glance round at Levasseur's face. There was light enough to show
                  that it was swollen, livid. The eyeballs stared and were bloodshot; the tongue
                  protruded; blood trickled from the nose. I had no weapon, but I raised him up by
                  main strength, without relaxing my grasp, and dashed him upon the stone floor at
                  the foot of the crucifix; and where I cast him he lay, irredeemable now—in my fury
                  I exulted to think—even by Him, whose emblem hung above him. I then took the
                  fainting form of Alphonsine in my arms, and bore it to Madame de St. Luc's
                  cell.
               We escaped. Why need I dwell on these things? Paris, the faubourgs, the villages,
                  floated off behind us, like a misty and lamp-lit dream. We scarcely knew more than
                  that the breath of heaven fanned our burning temples. If at times a recollection
                  of what we had left came upon the horizon of our imagination like a spectral
                  chase, it only urged us the more madly forward in our flight, and forced the
                  breeze more revivingly against our brows.
               We turned our faces southwards. As long as it was night, we kept the highroad; and
                  so long we were able to avail ourselves of a conveyance. But when daylight
                  appeared this had to be relinquished, and then the fields and farm-houses afforded
                  us tracks and a shelter. The simplest things, emblems of the country and of
                  freedom, drew tears from our eyes. Our feelings had all been intensified in
                  proportion to the paucity of objects we had to exercise them upon; and now the
                  sight of a peasant driving his team in the fallow, a milk-maid returning home with
                  her pail; nay, even the kine ruminating in the pasture, the very trees and grass
                  waving in the breeze, kindled irrepressible emotions within our hearts. On the way
                  I made full confession to the heroic creature of my cruel suspicions, of my
                  employment of Levasseur, of my own counter-plan—of all that to her was still
                  inexplicable. I made no attempt at extenuation. I could only confess myself
                  utterly unworthy of her, and acknowledge that my bitterest punishment
                  was to learn how faultless was the object I had presumed to suspect of a taint of
                  earthly corruption. She wept as I recounted these things, received my explanations
                  with a heavenly tenderness, smiled sadly at my doubts—and forgave me. We were too
                  new to life, and too uncertain of its lasting, to waste time upon anything but the
                  great love that possessed us.
               We had to trust ourselves to numerous individuals. It was a slender chance of our
                  reaching Tours unbetrayed. Terror reigned around; and when occasionally we were
                  constrained to ask for shelter in some remote and humble homestead, even where it
                  was afforded, paleness and trembling seized upon the inmates, and we were
                  dismissed with furtive haste, leaving dread and disquiet behind us, as if a crime
                  had been committed upon the premises.
               Besides, I could not help experiencing a sort of boding apprehension, coupling
                  itself with the revelations of the wretch Levasseur. Suppose him dead, had his
                  agents already received instructions to act, and were we to be the victims of
                  posthumous malignity? It was plain that he had had his reason for not having us
                  swept away in the usual course to the Conciergerie. Perhaps he judged that he
                  should have a freer stage for the accomplishment of his iniquitous designs outside
                  the prison walls. It was easy to understand his hints as to seeing us soon again.
                  Now the question arose on the supposition that he was dead, should we change our
                  course at once? I did not hesitate to decide against doing so, We had a plan laid,
                  the only one which afforded rational
                  grounds of hope, but which might have been thwarted by the machinations of a
                  traitor. He being dead we had so much the better chance of success, since under no
                  circumstances could his emissaries act without communicating with him—these not
                  being times for men to compromise themselves without the warrant of influential
                  instigators. But suppose him alive—I would not allow myself to speculate upon this
                  alternative at all. The thing, I insisted, was impossible. Nevertheless, prudence
                  constrained us so far to deviate from our plan, as to make Tours only a first
                  halting-place, with the design of penetrating at once further into the west, where
                  we should be more out of the reach of pursuit.
               We arrived here safely. The archbishop had made his plans previously, and
                  contrived matters so, that a passage leading from the palace underground was open
                  for us; and the secret oratory which existed in the spot where we now stand,
                  received the weary party of fugitives on the night of their arrival. Then for the
                  first time since our departure from the prison were we able to collect our
                  thoughts, and devise means for our ultimate safety.
               Our plans were as follows: We were to remain where we were for the night, and the
                  next day the archbishop and I, after ascertaining as well as we could the state of
                  public feeling in Tours, were to proceed down the river to the retired hamlet of
                  Luynes, and there engage one of the flat-bottomed boats that ply on the river,
                  which was to be ready for us—that is, for Alphonsine, her aunt, and myself—to
                  embark on the same night, and follow the current of the Loire in the direction of
                  La Vendée, where we believed we should find friends, and were likely to obtain an
                  asylum. But before we set out upon our voyage, the exemplary prelate, who had thus
                  far been our guide, protector, and friend, was to perform for us a last service,
                  and within this apartment unite my adored Alphonsine and me in the holy bond of
                  wedlock.
               Look about you, young man. Does this look like an asylum of refuge—a bridal
                  chamber! Behold these gigantic blocks, dislocated as if by an arm still more
                  gigantic, and ask yourself whether an ordinary frenzy, even of destruction, could
                  have wrought the ruin you see!
               The next morning arose, serene and bright. As Alphonsine and I ascended from the
                  apartments beneath into the secluded gardens of the Archevêché, and for the first
                  time looked upon the enchantment of heaven and earth in freedom and together, we
                  felt our souls overpowered, and stood long in speechlessness under the open sky,
                  unable to do more than silently inhale an atmosphere of happiness almost too rare
                  for our subdued spirits. I then turned towards Alphonsine, and perceived the tears
                  coursing down her marble cheeks.
               "Oh! my well beloved," cried I; "give this day at least to smiles, and let the
                  current of our destiny, if it must form to itself a channel of tears, flow round
                  the tranquil island of this present happiness, even though it meet tomorrow, to
                  unite the past and the future in one stream of sorrow!"
               I could not adopt another tone, though I felt how impossible it was for such
                  language to establish confidence within her breast. We had gone through too
                  much—our fortunes had been of too eventful and too terrible a cast, to make the
                  idea of security anything but a mockery. It was better to be true than to be
                  cheerful, and in a minute my tears mixed with hers.
               "In a few days, perhaps, Alphonsine, we may feel that there is a life before us. I
                  admit that as yet we cannot reckon upon an hour."
               "Yes, Charles, until then we have only to hope the best, and be prepared for the worst. Your gift is
                  yet upon my bosom"—here she showed me the golden guillotine suspended from her
                  neck. "As long as I wear this I am reminded that I belong half to death, half to
                  life. Only when we are safe will I remove it from its present place, and preserve
                  it as a relic of dangers—and pleasures—that are past."
               So saying, she replaced it in the folds of her dress next her heart, and a smile,
                  the last I ever saw her wear, dawned upon her pallid countenance. If I imprinted a
                  kiss upon those lips, and drew that form to my breast, it was with so largely
                  mingled a sense of foreboding, and so evasive and unrealized a throb of joy, that
                  it became a question with me, in after years, whether the bliss of that instant
                  did not belong to the domain of dreams, and deserve a place among the other
                  aspirations after which a heart destined to misfortune feebly flutters out of the
                  shadow of a doom it cannot escape.
               The first buds of spring tipped the fruit trees of the garden. A hundred birds
                  sported from branch to branch, and the frosty dew of the morning yet hung upon the
                  early flowers. We could not but feel all this. These simple things, of all other
                  things, went most to our hearts. We fell upon our knees, and prayed there under
                  the open sky.
               And there I quitted her. Oh, God! can I go on? The archbishop and I found the town
                  in a state of fierce excitement. Recent arrivals from Paris had still further
                  inflamed the revolutionary zeal of the inhabitants, whose vicinity to the seat of
                  the Vendean war had rendered them from the first ardent partisans of the Montagne.
                  Riotous parties paraded the streets, armed with weapons, carrying fire-brands, and
                  shouting their wild carmagnoles, and all
                  business was suspended. It was with difficulty, even under the favor of our
                  disguise, that we evaded these bands, and made our way across the bridge, to the
                  right bank, towards St. Cyr and Luynes. At last, however, we reached the hamlet;
                  and my companion's former knowledge of the inhabitants enabled us to bribe an old
                  boatman, whom he remembered to have been less imbued with the new ideas than his
                  neighbors, to drop the party down during the night below Saumur, where we could
                  put ourselves at once in communication with certain Seigneurs of the Bocage, in
                  whom we knew we should find stanch friends. Having settled this matter to our
                  satisfaction, we turned our steps towards Tours again, my heart in a glow of
                  anticipation, and even the good archbishop elated with the near prospect of our
                  speedy deliverance. For himself, he refused to accompany us. He trusted to some
                  faithful friends, and a knowledge of the hiding-places about his own palace, and
                  preferred awaiting a turn of affairs, which it was his fixed opinion would
                  speedily arrive.
               It was evening before we drew near the city; but long before we reached the
                  barriers, the shouts of the mob were audible, and to our alarm we heard the tocsin
                  ringing from the great Abbey of St. Martin. We hastened our steps, only to
                  discover on entering the town that a dreadful scene of havoc and devastation was
                  going forward. Above the shouts of the mob screams arose, as if from victims of
                  their barbarity; and now and then there shot up a lurid glare towards the sky,
                  which betokened too plainly that the ravages of fire were to be added that night
                  to those of violence and plunder. Advancing in an easterly direction, we
                  discovered that the ancient Abbey Church of St. Martin, the pride of central
                  France, from whence the tocsin had been sounding, was the principal object of the
                  fury of the mob, probably for that very reason. It was in flames before we arrived
                  there, and we met many wretches escaping with the sacred vessels and ornaments, their share of the
                  spoil. Hurrying our steps towards the Cathedral, we found the mob less numerous
                  and violent in that direction, and, although St. Julien was on fire, it was
                  evident that the set of the raging tide was towards St. Martin, and that the
                  quarters in our neighborhood were emptying themselves of their population, to
                  swell the main flood thereabouts. This process appeared to me, I remember, even in
                  that hurried and anxious moment, to go forward according to an organized system,
                  and as if under the guidance of certain recognised leaders; for I repeatedly heard
                  the words à droit, à gauche, given at the head
                  of the gangs, by voices which they seemed instructed to obey.
               The precincts of the palace were completely deserted. Not a sound was to be heard
                  but the distant hubbub of the rioters, and occasionally the crash of a roof or
                  tower of one of the burning edifices. When this occurred, we were further notified
                  of the catastrophe by the sudden leap of the towers of the Cathedral out of the
                  darkness, as they were smitten by the red-hot glow from behind us.
               With trembling joy we believed all safe; and stealing cautiously up, descended
                  into the concealed passage leading to our hiding-place. Traversing it as quickly
                  as we could in the pitchy darkness, we both of us stopped simultaneously. It
                  was—it must be—a dream. We rubbed our eyes. Where we had left the chamber we
                  emerged into this open cavern, into which the lurid sky darted its dull glances,
                  and the cries we had left found their way with the vapors and exhalations of the
                  night.
               Nobody was there. Nothing was to be seen but ruin. Not a vestige. Not a piece of
                  furniture. Not an article of clothing. Nothing but these huge fragments scattered
                  about, and the desperate marks of wedges and crowbars, and other mechanical means
                  of aiding human fury.
               Like lightning, Levasseur darted across my mind. "He is alive!" I shrieked,
                  dashing my hands up towards heaven. The next moment I had fled out through the
                  aperture into the darkness, leaving the archbishop motionless where he had first
                  become aware of the catastrophe.
               For weeks my existence is a dream. I believe I was mad. Levelled with the beasts,
                  I acquired the keen scent and sagacity of these tribes, when instinct draws them
                  after their prey. I remember myself at Saumur, at Angers in the forests of
                  Brittany, subsisting upon roots. The slot of my enemy lay towards Nantes. There
                  Carrier was multiplying his human sacrifices. Blood was too slow in flowing. The
                  river offered more speedy execution, and a roomier grave. Shoals of victims choked
                  the channels of the Loire, and turned its waters into putridity. There were people
                  about, here and there, who could afford some inklings. Kennelling as I did with
                  the wolves, with them I made nightly descents upon habitual places and the abodes
                  of men. As these bore away lambs and other weaklings of the flock, so I fragments
                  of intelligence, whispers, hearsays, eavesdroppings, and vague surmises of the
                  bloodshot stranger, who was urging some females westward. I saw whither all this
                  was tending. Hope had left my bosom; I scarcely cared to accomplish a rescue; and
                  dared not think upon anything but revenge. To enter Nantes was certain death, and
                  death would frustrate all my objects, and crown his with
                  triumph—so I reserved myself to the consummation.
               I joined the remnant of the Vendeans, wandering houselessly through Brittany, and
                  prowling about since the battle of Savenay in bands of fifties and hundreds, with
                  every man's hand against them. For such I was a fit companion. They armed me; I
                  clasped my sword like a friend who was to do me a service. Thenceforth it was my
                  closest companion.
               
               Daring as were these Chouans, they found in me one whom they could not hope to
                  rival. The gang I led gained a name for its desperate audacity, and carried terror
                  even to the gates of Nantes, within which unhappy town likewise that fearful
                  presence now stalked abroad in visible shape, and daily devoured its victims
                  wholesale. The river, which had flowed past the walls ever since they were built,
                  bearing blessings on its bosom and reflecting heaven on its surface, now yawned
                  like a judgment close at hand, and into its depths continually travelled the youth
                  and bravery and beauty and virtue and loyalty of Nantes. We, when we
                  were caught, were shot; but it was not easy to catch us—and we generally obtained
                  more than life for life.
               It was the spring equinox. Carrier's noyades
                  went on; it was now whole ship-loads of victims that he sent down the stream, to
                  be sunk bodily at its mouth, where he believed the ocean would do the rest, and
                  rid him of further trouble. But ocean itself began to show symptoms of refusing to
                  dispose of more dead than lay to its own account. It had enough to answer for
                  already. Renouncing complicity in these deeds of earth, it at last took advantage
                  of a mighty west wind and cast the unburied mass of mortality at the mouth of the
                  stream that had rejected it. The whole population flocked down to discover and
                  reclaim its dead. What it found it had to dispute with the ospreys and vultures,
                  and the loathsome familiarity of wild beasts, which struggled between the legs of
                  the human throng, in the absorbing fascination of such a banquet.
               And like a fascinated wild beast there am I. The storm howls across the bleak
                  sands, carrying the grains along like a mist, mingled with the surf and
                  foam-flakes. And the blast, as it howls, bears other sounds upon it—shrieks of
                  sea-mews, and of mothers and daughters of stranded corpses, croakings of
                  quarrelling ravens, and the imprecations tions of desperate outlaws, who dispute
                  the bones of a comrade. There I stand, looking seawards, for I know that ocean has
                  an account to render up to me, and that it will fulfil its trust. And it is
                  without shuddering, therefore, that I find at my feet a thing of human outline,
                  having mark and token which may be recognised, such as a ribbon with a golden
                  ornament attached, and on the ornament the words inscribed— 
                     
                        La tete tombe, le coeur reste.
                     
                  
               
               Yes, boy, I am prepared for all that; and with my sword I dig a hole in the sand,
                  high up, above the reach of the tides, and there I cover up that human remnant,
                  after placing the ornament in my bosom; then, having taken the bearings, I plunge
                  into the woods again, and whet my blunted sword against the first smooth stone I
                  find.
               One object was left me in life. It wore a definite aspect; but the means of
                  obtaining it were difficult and circuitous. For many a month I herded with the
                  Chouans of Bretagne; a wild, irregular banditti. The gang I led hovered closer to
                  the enemy than the rest of our adherents, and addicted themselves less to plunder.
                  Something which might be called strategy marked our movements, and the information
                  we acquired from prisoners was frequently of considerable service to the cause of
                  the royalists in communication with Puisaye and the British government.
               Since the discovery of the body, my character had undergone a change. I was no
                  longer the reckless madman who inspired respect only by his personal daring. My
                  mind now controlled without impeding the impetuosity of my animal nature. In
                  particular, a certain tact and subtlety I evinced in the examination of prisoners
                  and deserters, caused that department at last to be left exclusively to me; and it
                  was during this period that I perfected and brought to the condition of a system, that theory of the
                  investigation of character which I put in practice on my first encountering
                  you.
               Ever and anon, I was able to glean some intelligence respecting my enemy. He was
                  near me. When Carrier was superseded at Nantes, he was for a time in disgrace as
                  his friend; but soon associated himself with Hoche, and distinguished himself, one
                  deserter informed me, by the sanguinary zeal he showed in prosecuting the design
                  of his chief, which consisted, as in La Vendeé, in hemming in the remnants of the
                  insurgents by a narrowing cordon, out of which
                  they had no possible escape, and within which, unless some sudden blow was struck,
                  they must be all finally enveloped and taken. With a counter-instinct to mine, he,
                  too, I felt, knew that the man he had wronged was here, and that he must be got
                  rid of to make life safe. This was what infused such uncompromising ferocity into
                  his conduct, and gave his acts so sanguinary a complexion, as to call more than
                  once for a reprimand and rebuke from his chief. It was a single combat between us;
                  we both of us strengthened the ranks of two opposing armies, and advanced the
                  causes of royalty and republicanism respectively, only in order that we, the
                  centre of our war and of our world, might meet at last and terminate the struggle
                  with the existence of one or both of us.
               You know how events hurried on. How an amnesty was offered to us if we would lay
                  down our arms. Lay down our arms! I grasped my sword, and laughed, till the forest
                  rang again. How Carrier came to the guillotine—he was not my quarry;
                  I let him die without a thought. How treachery appeared among us—and symptoms of
                  disaffection. We held together, for war was my game. To the meeting
                  at La Mabilaye I repaired; for, believing that Hoche was to be there, I calculated
                  on his accompanying him. I know not why it was, but Hoche declined
                  coming, and we did not meet. Tout était aux
                     mieux. How we were organized into regular companies of chasseurs
                  under Stofflet, and manœuvred as a regular army, notwithstanding the nominal
                  truce; how the British squadron hove in sight, and the white cockade was mounted
                  on every cap, and long and reiterated shouts of Vive le
                     roi! rent the air, and rang through the forests of Brittany. All this
                  is history; so is the result. My part alone of these deeds and disasters is
                  necessary to be told.
               The emigrant army landed from the English fleet at Quiberon. The noblest blood of
                  France was there assembled; and I found myself once more associated with the
                  Polignacs, and the Clermont-Tonnerres, and the Condés, and the D'Orsays. I was
                  assigned the command I most coveted, however, that of my own Chouans, whom I knew,
                  and who knew me. Had all known themselves and each other as we did, the expedition
                  might have turned out differently.
               I soon saw that things were going wrong; I had become lynx-eyed. There was no
                  concentration, no organized system. There was no prince of the house of Bourbon
                  around whom to rally. Puisaye and D'Hervilly quarrelled. Instead of an
                  instantaneous advance, as urged by Tinteniac and me, days were wasted in
                  consultations and disputes, which came to nothing. I soon saw that we were to be
                  victims—but I was determined to achieve my object.
               The republican armies closed round us. Desperately we confronted them; but
                  individual valor could not make amends for the want of unity of plan. Hoche drove
                  us in from point to point; and at length, having taken St. Barbe, shut us up in
                  the narrow peninsula of Quiberon, whence we must either escape to the British
                  fleet, or die without hope of quarter.
               As the republican front closed with us, I became, from day to day, more intimately acquainted with
                  Levasseur's movements. Every prisoner had something to tell. His bloodthirsty
                  ferocity had gained him celebrity amongst them. I knew his division, his quarters,
                  his assigned place on each day's march—nay, his very uniform, and the color of his
                  horse. I kept myself so thoroughly in the secret of the man's movements, that
                  whenever we should meet in open field, I should be able without difficulty to mark
                  him out, and have him before me in the thickest confusion of battle.
               The night of the 20th of July, 1795, fell dark and tempestuous. The waves rolled
                  in with fury upon the narrow strip of sand we yet retained upon the shore of
                  France. Our only barrier against the enemy was Fort Penthièvre, which stood, a
                  darker mass, against the dark sky. I lay upon the sand, with my sword—my
                  inseparable companion—in my grasp. Suddenly, a shout was heard above the roar of
                  the waters. I started up—but could see nothing. It proceeded from the direction of
                  the fort, and I knew that a surprise was at least attempted, if it had not
                  succeeded. A moment's agony passed across my brow, like the glow of a fierce fire.
                  This was the only contingency I had not foreseen; my enemy and I
                  might be close to each other in the darkness without coming into
                  contact.
               My worst suspicions were the best founded. Fort Penthièvre had been surprised and
                  taken—we were now at the mercy of the republican army. All those within reach of
                  me rose along with me, and obeying the word of command, placed themselves in
                  order, and rushed upon the advancing enemy. The collision was tremendous. Hoche's
                  guns had already begun to play, and in a few minutes the English squadron, which
                  had been obliged to keep out to sea in consequence of the tempest, announced their
                  presence by the roar of their artillery. From the first I saw that resistance was
                  hopeless; and that escape was almost equally so. D'Hervilly was mortally wounded;
                  Sombreuil, who succeeded him, was a stranger to the place, and lost his presence
                  of mind. It was a hopeless carnage, and my men fell around me in heaps.
                  Nevertheless, I assumed the command which others were unable to exercise, and
                  contrived for some time to protect the masses of emigrants who, with their wives
                  and children, were rushing into the water to embark on board the English boats. It
                  must have been calm; for while engaged in this arduous duty, I took advantage of
                  every cannon shot fired close to me, to survey the opposite ranks in search of
                  Levasseur. In so dark a night, the flash of the discharge from a piece of ordnance
                  throws an intense glare for a considerable space; and as I had habituated my eyes
                  to take in numerous objects distinctly at a sudden glance, I was now, after one or
                  two of these momentary surveys, able to ascertain with tolerable accuracy the
                  order of the hostile column, and where I ought to look for him. I found that in
                  order to confront him, I must move to the right, or as close to the edge of the
                  sea as possible. This was difficult, in the face of the enemy; but finding that
                  Sombreuil had just come up to the point I defended with a fresh body of emigrants,
                  I drew my exhausted men off for a moment, and moving round a small sandy eminence,
                  threw them once more upon the hostile army, almost within the surf of the
                  shoreward waves.
               The result was as I had anticipated. Certain signs gave evidence of Levasseur's
                  vicinity. I recognised the uniform of his corps, and at last had the inexpressible
                  satisfaction of hearing his voice, above the roar of the waves, urging on his
                  men.
               By this time matters had drawn to a conclusion. The two armies were mingled
                  together in the darkness. The few boats which had succeeded in gaining the shore,
                  had either sunk or were sheering off overloaded with fugitives. In all directions cries were heard of "quarter!
                  quarter!" a boon which in some instances was accorded by the soldiers, as the
                  despairing emigrants or Chouans laid down their arms; though in most these
                  wretches were cut down without mercy. From the sea, the frightful confusion was
                  added to by the broadsides of the British fleet poured in upon the shore, and
                  sweeping off friend and foe in indiscriminate slaughter. I had almost given up the
                  hope of surviving to fulfil my mission, when a sudden flash discovered Levasseur
                  within five yards of me, a little advanced before his men, in the act of pointing
                  a gun at a boat which had just quitted the shore, filled with women and
                  children.
               I might have rushed forward and cut him down. I do not know why I did not do so. I
                  walked up to him, and laid my hand upon his shoulder, uttering in his ear the word
                  "Levasseur!" He started up from the stooping posture, and in an instant drew a
                  pistol from his belt, and fired. Had he not been disconcerted, he must have killed
                  me; as it was, the ball grazed my ribs. He drew back, aghast.
               "Coward!" cried I; "draw your sword, I shall wait until you can defend
                  yourself."
               We could see each other, now we were so close, by the gleaming of the cannonade.
                  Even at that desperate moment, I was startled as I suddenly became conscious that
                  a change had taken place in his appearance. His black hair had grown
                     white. The confirmation of an original surmise flashed across my mind.
                  He must have existed for a greater or less period of time under the belief that,
                  at the moment of his mortal sin, he had fallen into the hands of the LIVING
                  GOD.
               "Why should we fight?" he now exclaimed, in a subdued voice. "She is dead, long
                  ago."
               "And buried!" cried I, holding up to his eyes the Golden Guillotine.
               "God! Whence has that come?"
               "From the depths of the ocean, in which thy bones shall whiten ere long.
                  Thoughtest thou that thou wert to escape the Avenger of Blood, because thou hadst
                  placed a mill-stone round the neck of thy secret, and sunk it in the sea?"
               "De Martigny, thou wast my rival—thou soughtest to strangle me—was it not so?"
               With death staring him in the face, he was yearning to extract some expression
                  which should relieve him once for all from the remnants of the horrible suspicion
                  which had once haunted him. I saw that; and at the same time felt myself growing
                  weak from loss of blood; yet, so much was I still overpowered with the thought of
                  the fiery tortures the wretch must have gone through to turn the stony blackness
                  of his locks into silver in the time, that I could not bring myself to sabre him,
                  and have done with him.
               Nor had I need. He had just observed my growing faintness, and was planting his
                  feet to commence the combat in which the chances began to show in his favor, when
                  a ball from an English line-of-battle ship ploughed the sand over both of us, and
                  in its ricochet tore Levasseur's right arm from
                  its socket, laying the ribs of the same side bare to the waist. We fell
                  together—he in the agonies of death, I from the shock and previous loss of blood.
                  I had strength left to dip my finger in the pool of gore between us—whether in his
                  or mine I know not, or both mingled together—and write upon his forehead the
                  single word—ALPHONSINE. This I did that the devils might know what to do with
                  him.
               Our men, on both sides, had missed us, and as the action now confined itself to
                  another quarter, they had drawn off to lend their aid at that point. I was left
                  alone with the dying man; and witnessed the blackness of his brow fade into the spectral pallor of death, upon
                  which the gory letters came out like faint writing held against a fire.
               The object of my life was accomplished; dizziness came over me. I believed that I
                  died.
               I recovered my consciousness on board of a British man-of-war. It was not for some
                  days afterwards that I discovered how I had been saved. An officer who, taking
                  advantage of the darkness, had pushed boldly on shore in a boat just after the
                  termination of the action, in the hope of saving somebody, and who saw me lying
                  wounded and motionless, but with some signs of life about me, had, at the risk of
                  his own, cutlass in hand, rescued me from two republican soldiers who were just
                  about to knock me on the head and plunder me, and borne me aboard Admiral Warren's
                  squadron.
               Young man, little more remains to be said. When, years afterwards, royalty had
                  been restored to France, I repaired to the lonely beach at the mouth of the Loire,
                  and had the bones of all that had once made life dear reverently removed to this
                  sacred precinct, where, with the consent of the archbishop, they were buried
                  privately, and a certain number of masses appointed to be said for the soul of the
                  departed. Over this grave I posted myself a sentinel for life. Here I pass my
                  days—often my nights. The venerable archbishop would have solaced my watchings by
                  his presence over and over again, but I withstood him. I preferred performing this
                  duty alone. Nevertheless, when he died, I was smitten to the heart, as you saw—for
                  I had lost my last friend.
            
            
               Edward Drysdale.
               ABOUT the year 1798, James Bradshaw and William Drysdale, both invalided masters
                  of the Royal Navy, cast anchor for the remainder of their lives at about twelve
                  miles' distance from Exeter, on the London road. Bradshaw named his domicile, an
                  old-fashioned straggling building, Rodney Place, in honor of the admiral in whose
                  great victory he had fought. Drysdale's smaller and snugger dwelling, about half a
                  mile away from Rodney Place, was called Poplar Cottage, and about midway between
                  them stood the Hunter's Inn, a roadside public-house, kept by one Thomas Burnham,
                  a stouthearted, jolly-bellied individual, the comeliness of whose rubicund
                  figure-head was considerably damaged by the loss of an eye, of which, however, it
                  is right to say, the extinguished light appeared to have been transferred in
                  undiminished intensity to its fiery, piercing fellow. The retired masters, who had
                  long known each other, were intimate as brothers, notwithstanding that Bradshaw
                  was much the richest of the two, having contrived to pick up a considerable amount
                  of prize money, in addition to a rather
                  large sum inherited from his father. Neither did the difference of circumstances
                  oppose, in Bradshaw's opinion, the slightest obstacle to the union of his niece
                  and heiress, Rachel Elford, with Edward Drysdale, his fellow veteran's only
                  surviving offspring. The precedent condition, however, was, that Edward should
                  attain permanent rank in the Royal Navy, and with this view a midshipman's warrant
                  was obtained in '99 for the young man, then in his eighteenth year, and he was
                  despatched to sea.
               The naval profession proved to be, unfortunately, one for which Edward Drysdale
                  was altogether unfitted by temperament and bent of mind, and sad consequences
                  followed. He had been at sea about eighteen months, when news reached England of a
                  desperate, but successful, cutting-out affair by the boats of the frigate to which
                  he belonged. His name was not mentioned in the official report—but that could
                  hardly have been hoped for—neither was it in the list of killed and wounded. A map
                  of the coast where the fight took place was procured; the battle was fought over
                  and over again by the two veterans, and they were still indulging in these
                  pleasures of the imagination, in the parlor of the "Hunter's Inn," when the
                  landlord entered with a Plymouth paper in his hand, upon one paragraph in which
                  his single orb of vision glared with fiery indignation. It was an extract from a
                  letter written by one of the frigate's officers, plainly intimating that
                  Midshipman Drysdale had shown the white feather in the late brush with the enemy,
                  and would be sent home by the first opportunity. The stroke of a dagger could have
                  been nothing compared with the sharp agony which such an announcement inflicted on
                  the young man's father, and Bradshaw was for a few moments equally
                  thunder-stricken. But he quickly rallied. William Drysdale's son a coward! Pooh!
                  the thing was out of nature—impossible; and very hearty were his maledictions,
                  savagely echoed by Burnham, with whom young Drysdale was a great favorite, of the
                  lying lubber that wrote the letter, and the newspaper rascals that printed it.
               Alas! it was but too true! On the third evening after the appearance of the
                  alarming paragraph the two mariners were sitting in the porch of Poplar Cottage,
                  separated only by a flower garden from the main road, conversing upon the sad and
                  constantly recurring topic, when the coach from London came in sight. A youthful
                  figure, in naval uniform, on the box-seat, instantly riveted their attention, as
                  it did that of Rachel Elford, who was standing in the little garden, apparently
                  absorbed till that moment by the shrubs and flowers. The coach rapidly drew near,
                  stopped, and Edward Drysdale alighted from it. The two seamen, instead of waiting
                  for his approach, hastily arose from their seats and went into the cottage, as
                  much perhaps to avoid the humiliating though compassionate glances of the outside
                  passengers, as from any other motive. The young man was deadly pale, and seemed to
                  have hardly sufficient strength to move back the light wicket-gate which admitted
                  to the garden. He held by it till the coach had passed on, and then turned with a
                  beseeching, half-reproachful look towards Rachel. She, poor girl, was as much
                  agitated as himself, and appeared to be eagerly scanning his countenance, as if
                  hopeful of reading there a contradiction of the dishonoring rumor that had got
                  abroad. In answer to his mute appeal, she stepped quickly towards him, clasped his
                  proffered hand in both hers, and with a faint and trembling voice ejaculated—
               "Dear, dear Edward! It is not true—I am sure it is not, that you—that you——"
               "That I, Rachel, have been dismissed the naval service, as unfit to serve his
                  majesty, is quite true," rejoined
                  Edward Drysdale, slowly, and with partially recovered calm—"quite true."
               The young woman shrank indignantly from him; fire glanced in her suffused eyes,
                  and her light, elegant figure appeared to grow and dilate with irrepressible
                  scorn, as this avowal fell upon her ear. "A coward she vehemently exclaimed; "you
                  that—but no," she added, giving away again to grief and tenderness, as she looked
                  upon the fine, intelligent countenance of her lover, "it cannot be; there must be
                  some error—some mistake. It is impossible!"
               "There is error and mistake, Rachel; but the world will never, I
                  fear, admit so much. But come, let us in; you will go with me!"
               We will not follow them till the first outburst of angry excitement is past; till
                  the father's passionate, heart-broken reproaches have subsided to a more patient,
                  subdued, faintly-hopeful sorrow, and Rachel's wavering faith in the manhood of her
                  betrothed has regained something of its old firmness. Entering then, we shall find
                  that only Mr. Bradshaw has remained obstinately and contemptuously deaf to what
                  the young man has falteringly urged in vindication of his behavior in the unhappy
                  affair which led to his dismissal from the service. He had, it appeared, suddenly
                  fainted at the sight of the hideous carnage in which, for the first time in his
                  life, he found himself involved.
               "You have a letter, you say, from Captain Otway," said Mr. Drysdale, partially
                  raising his head from his hands, in which it had been buried whilst his son was
                  speaking. "Where is it? Give it to Rachel; I cannot see the words."
               The note was directed to Mr. Drysdale, whom Captain Otway personally knew, and was
                  no doubt kindly intended to soften the blow, the return of his son under such
                  circumstances cumstances must inflict. Although deciding that Edward Drysdale was
                  unfit for the naval profession, he did not think that the failure of the young
                  man's physical nerve, in one of the most murderous encounters that had occurred
                  during the war, was attributable to deficiency of true courage; and as a proof
                  that it was not, Captain Otway mentioned that the young man had jumped overboard
                  during half a gale of wind, and when night was falling, and saved, at much peril
                  to himself, a seaman's life. This was the substance of the note. As soon as Rachel
                  ceased reading, Mr. Drysdale looked deprecatingly in his friend's face, and
                  murmured, "You hear?"
               "Yes, William Drysdale, I do. I never doubted that your son was a good swimmer, no
                  more than I do that coward means coward, and that all the letters in the alphabet
                  cannot spell it to mean anything else. Come, Rachel," added the grim, unreasoning,
                  iron-tempered veteran, "let us be gone. And God bless, and if it be possible
                  comfort ye, old friend. Good-bye! No, thank ye, young sir!" he continued, with
                  renewed fierceness, as Edward Drysdale snatched at his hand. "That hand was once
                  grasped by Rodney, in some such another business as the letter speaks of, when its
                  owner did not faint! It must not be touched by you!"
               The elder Drysdale took not long afterwards to his bed. He had been ailing for
                  some time; but no question that mortification at his son's failure in the
                  profession to which he had with so much pride devoted him, helped to weaken the
                  springs of life, and accelerate his end, which took place about six months after
                  Edward's return home. The father and son had become entirely reconciled with each
                  other, and almost the last accents which faltered from the lips of the dying
                  seaman, were a prayer to Bradshaw to forget and forgive what had passed, and renew
                  his sanction to the marriage of Edward
                  and his niece. The stern man was inexorable; and his pitiless reply was, that he
                  would a thousand times rather follow Rachel to her grave.
               The constancy of the young people was not, however, to be subdued, and something
                  more than a year after Mr. Drysdale's death they married; their present resources,
                  the rents—about one hundred and twenty pounds per annum—of a number of small
                  tenements at Exeter. They removed to within three miles of that city, and dwelt
                  there in sufficiency and peace, for about five years, when the exigencies of a
                  fast increasing family induced them to dispose, not very advantageously, of their
                  cottage property, and embark the proceeds in a showy speculation, promising, of
                  course, immense results, and really ending, in the brief space of six months, in
                  their utter ruin. Edward Drysdale found himself, in lieu of his golden hopes,
                  worth about two hundred pounds less than nothing. The usual consequences followed.
                  An undefended suit-at-law speedily reached the stage at which execution might be
                  issued, and unless a considerable sum of money could be instantly raised, his
                  furniture would be seized under a fi. fa., and sacrificed to no
                  purpose.
               One only possible expedient remained—that of once more endeavoring to soften the
                  obduracy of Mr. Bradshaw. This it was finally determined to attempt, and Mr. and
                  Mrs. Drysdale set off, by a London morning coach, upon the well-nigh hopeless
                  speculation. They alighted at the Hunter's Inn, where Drysdale remained, whilst
                  his wife proceeded alone to Rodney Place. Thomas Burnham was friendly and
                  good-natured as ever. The old mariner, he told Drysdale, was visibly failing, and
                  his chief amusement seemed to be scraping together and hoarding up money. James
                  Berry, a broken-down tailor, and a chap, according to Burnham, who knew how many
                  beans made five as well as any man in Devonshire, had been for some time valet,
                  gardener, and general factotum at Rodney Place, and appeared to exercise great
                  influence over Mr. Bradshaw. The only other person in the establishment was the
                  old cook, Margery Deans, who, never otherwise since he had known her than
                  desperately hard of hearing, was now become deaf as a stone. Drysdale, it was
                  afterwards remembered, listened to all this with eager attention, and was
                  especially inquisitive and talkative respecting Mr. Bradshaw's hoarding
                  propensities, and the solitary, unprotected state in which he lived.
               Mrs. Drysdale was long gone; but the tremulous hopes which her protracted stay
                  called feebly forth, vanished at the sight of her pale, tearful, yet resolved
                  aspect. "It is useless, Edward," she murmured, with her arms cast lovingly about
                  her husband's neck, and looking in his face with far more lavish expression of
                  affection than when, with orange-blossoms in her hair, she stood a
                  newly-consecrated wife beside him; "it is useless to expect relief from my uncle,
                  save upon the heartless, impossible condition you know of. But let us home. God's
                  heaven is still above our heads, though clouds and darkness rest between. We will
                  trust in Him, Edward, and fear not."
               So brave a woman should have been matched with a stout-hearted man; but this,
                  unhappily, was not the case. Edward Drysdale was utterly despondent, and he
                  listened, as his wife was afterwards fain to admit to herself and others, with
                  impatient reluctance to all she said as they journeyed homewards, save when the
                  condition of help spoken of, namely, that she should abandon her husband, and take
                  up her abode with her children at Rodney Place, was discussed—by her indignantly.
                  Once, also, when she mentioned that the old will in her favor was not yet
                  destroyed, but would be, her uncle threatened, if she did not soon return, a bright, almost fiery expression
                  seemed to leap from his usually mild, reflective eyes, and partially dissipate the
                  thick gloom which mantled his features.
               This occurred on a winter's day in early March, and the evening up to seven
                  o'clock had passed gloomily away with the Drysdales, when all at once the husband,
                  starting from a profound reverie, said he would take a walk as far as Exeter, see
                  the attorney in the suit against him, and, if possible, gain a little time for the
                  arrangement of the debt. His wife acquiesced, though with small hope of any
                  favorable result, and the strangely abstracted man left the house.
               Ten o'clock, the hour by which Edward Drysdale had promised to return, chimed from
                  a dial on the mantelpiece. Mrs. Drysdale trimmed the fire, lit the candles, which
                  for economy's sake she had extinguished, and had their frugal supper laid. He came
                  not. Eleven o'clock! What could be detaining him so late? Twelve!—half-past
                  twelve! Rachel Drysdale was just about to bid the servant-maid, who was sitting up
                  in the kitchen, go to bed, when the sound of carriage-wheels going
                     towards Exeter stopped at the door. It was a return
                  post-chaise, and brought Edward Drysdale. He staggered, as if intoxicated, into
                  the kitchen, reached down a half-bottle of brandy from a cupboard, and took it to
                  the post-boy, who immediately drove off. Anne Moody, the servant-girl, was greatly
                  startled by her master's appearance; he looked, she afterwards stated, more the
                  color of a whited wall, than of flesh and blood, and shook and "cowered," as if he
                  had the ague. Mrs. Drysdale came into the kitchen, and stood gazing at her
                  husband, in a white, dumb kind of way (I am transcribing literally from the girl's
                  statement), till the outer door was fastened, when they both went up stairs into a
                  front sitting-room. Curiosity induced Anne Moody to follow, and she heard, just as
                  the door closed upon them, Mrs. Drysdale say, "You have not been to Exeter, I am
                  sure." This was said in a nervous, shaking voice, and her master replied, in the
                  same tone, "No; I changed my mind," or words to that effect. Then there was a
                  quick whispering for a minute or two, interrupted by a half stifled cry or scream
                  from Mrs. Drysdale. A sort of hubbub of words followed, which the girl, a very
                  intelligent person of her class by-the-by, could not hear, or at least could not
                  make out, till Mr. Drysdale said, in a louder, slower way, "You, Rachel—the
                  children are provided for; but, O God! at what a dreadful price!" Anne Moody,
                  fearful of detection, did not wait to hear more, but crept stealthily up stairs to
                  bed, as her mistress had ordered her to do, when she left the kitchen. On the
                  following morning the girl found her master and mistress both up, the kitchen and
                  parlor fires lit, and breakfast nearly over. Mr. Drysdale said he was in a hurry
                  to get to Exeter, and they had not thought it worth while to call her at
                  unseasonable hours. Both husband and wife looked wild and haggard, and this,
                  Moody, when she looked into their bed-chamber, was not at all surprised at, as it
                  was clear that neither of them had retired to rest. One thing and the other,
                  especially kissing and fondling the children over and over again, detained Mr.
                  Drysdale till half-past eight o'clock, and then, just as he was leaving the house,
                  three men confronted him! A constable of the name of Parsons, James Berry, Mr.
                  Bradshaw's servant, and Burnham, the landlord of the Hunter's Inn. They came to
                  arrest him on a charge of burglary and murder! Mr. Bradshaw had been found, early
                  in the morning, cruelly stabbed to death beside his plundered strong-box!
               I must pass lightly over the harrowing scenes which followed—the tumultuous agony
                  of the wife, and the despairing
                  asseverations of the husband, impossible to be implicitly believed in even by that
                  wife, for the criminating evidence was overwhelming. Drysdale had been seen
                  skulking about Rodney Place till very late, by both Burnham and Berry. In the room
                  through which he must have passed in going and returning from the scene of his
                  frightful crime his hat had been found; and it was now discovered that he,
                  Drysdale, had taken away and worn home one of Berry's—no doubt from hurry and
                  inadvertence. In addition to all this, a considerable sum of money in gold and
                  silver, inclosed in a canvas bag, well known to have belonged to the deceased, was
                  found upon his person! It appeared probable that the aim of the assassin had been
                  only robbery in the first instance, for the corpse of the unfortunate victim was
                  found clothed only in a night-dress. The fair inference therefore seemed to be,
                  that the robber, disturbed at his plunder by the wakeful old seaman, had been
                  compelled, perhaps reluctantly, to add the dreadful crime of murder to that which
                  he had originally contemplated. The outcry through the country was terrific, and
                  as Edward Drysdale, by the advice of Mr. Sims, the attorney, who subsequently
                  instructed Mr. Prince, reserved his defence, there appeared to be nothing of a
                  feather's weight to oppose against the tremendous mass of circumstance arrayed
                  against the prisoner.
               And when, upon the arrival of the king's commission at Exeter, Mr. Prince received
                  a very full and carefully drawn brief in defence—a specious, but almost wholly
                  unsupported story of the prisoner's, appeared all that could be relied upon in
                  rebuttal of the evidence for the crown. According to Edward Drysdale, he merely
                  sought Mr. Bradshaw upon the evening in question for the purpose of concluding
                  with that gentleman an arrangement for the separation of himself from his wife and
                  children, and their domiciliation at Rodney Place. It was further averred, that he
                  was received with greater civility than he expected; that the interview was a long
                  one, during which he, Drysdale, had seen nobody but Mr. Bradshaw, although he
                  believed the aged and deaf cook was in the kitchen; that he had arranged that Mrs.
                  Drysdale and his children should be early on the morrow with her uncle, and that
                  he had received the money found upon his person and at his house from the
                  deceased's own hands, in order to pay the debt and costs in the suit wherein
                  execution was about to be levied on his furniture, and that the residue was to be
                  applied to his, the prisoner's own use; that the expressions deposed to by Anne
                  Moody, and his own and Mrs. Drysdale's emotion after his return home, which had
                  told so heavily against him in the examinations before the magistrates, were
                  perfectly reconcilable with this statement—as, indeed, they were—and did not,
                  therefore, bear the frightful meaning that had been attached to them. With respect
                  to the change of hats, that might easily have happened, because his hat had been
                  left on entering in the hall-passage, and in his hurry in coming out by the same
                  way, he had no doubt mistaken Berry's for his own; but he solemnly denied having
                  been in the room, or near the part of the house, where his hat was alleged to have
                  been found.
               This was the gist of the explanation; but, unfortunately, it was not sustained by
                  any receivable testimony in any material particular. True, Mrs. Drysdale, whom
                  everybody fully believed, declared that this account exactly coincided with what
                  her husband told her immediately on arriving home in the post-chaise—but what of
                  that? It was not what story the prisoner had told, nor how many times he had told
                  it, that could avail, especially against the heavy improbabilities that weighed
                  upon his, at first view, plausible
                  statement. How was it that, knowing Mr. Bradshaw's almost insane dislike of
                  himself, he did not counsel his wife to make terms with her uncle, preparatory to
                  her returning to Rodney Place? And was it at all likely that Mr. Bradshaw, whose
                  implacable humor Mrs. Drysdale had experienced on the very day previous to the
                  murder, should have so suddenly softened towards the man he so thoroughly hated
                  and despised? I trow not. And the first consultation on the case wore a wretchedly
                  dismal aspect, till the hawk eye of Mr. Prince lit on an assertion of Thomas
                  Burnham's, that he had gone to Mr. Bradshaw's house upon some particular business
                  at a quarter-past twelve on the night of the murder, and had seen the deceased
                  alive at that time, who had answered him, as he frequently did, from his bedroom
                  window. "Rodney Place," said Mr. Prince, "is nine miles from Drysdale's residence.
                  I understood you to say, Mr. Sims, that Mrs. Drysdale declares her husband was at
                  home at twenty minutes to one?"
               "Certainly she does; but the wife's evidence, you are aware, cannot avail the
                  husband."
               "True; but the servant girl! the driver of the post-chaise! This is a vital point,
                  and must be cleared up without delay."
               I and Williams, Sims' clerk, set off instantly to see Mrs. Drysdale, who had not
                  left her room since her husband's apprehension. She was confident it was barely so
                  late as twenty minutes to one when the post-chaise drove up to the door. Her
                  evidence was, however, legally inadmissible, and our hopes rested on Anne Moody,
                  who was immediately called in. Her answer was exasperating. She had been asleep in
                  the kitchen, and could not positively say whether it was twelve, one, or two
                  o'clock when her master reached home. There was still a chance left—that of the
                  post-chaise driver. He did not, we found, reach Exeter, a distance of three miles
                  only from Mr. Drysdale's, till a quarter to three o'clock, and was then much the
                  worse for liquor. So much for our chance of proving an alibi.
               There was one circumstance perpetually harped upon by our bright one-eyed friend
                  of the Hunter's Inn—Cyclops, I and Williams called him. What had become of a large
                  sum, in notes, paid, it was well known, to Mr. Bradshaw three or four days before
                  his death? What also of a ruby ring, and some unset precious stones he had brought
                  from abroad, and which he had always estimated, rightly or wrongly, at so high a
                  price? Drysdale's house and garden had been turned inside out, but nothing had
                  been found, and so for that matter had Rodney Place, and its two remaining inmates
                  had been examined with the like ill success. Burnham, who was excessively
                  dissatisfied with the progress of affairs, swore there was an infernal mystery
                  somewhere, and that he shouldn't sleep till he had ferreted it out. That was his
                  business. Ours was to make the best of the wretched materials at our disposal; but
                  the result we all expected followed. The foregone conclusion of the jury that were
                  empanelled in the case was just about to be formally recorded in a verdict of
                  guilty, when a note was handed across to Mr. Sims. One Mr. Jay, a timber merchant,
                  who had heard the evidence of the postillion, desired to be examined. This the
                  judge at once assented to, and Mr. Jay deposed, that having left Exeter in his gig
                  upon pressing business, at about two o'clock on the morning of the murder, he had
                  observed a post-chaise at the edge of a pond about a mile and a half out of the
                  city, where the jaded horses had been, he supposed, drinking. They were standing
                  still, and the post-boy, who was inside, and had reins to drive with passed
                  through the front windows, was fast
                  asleep—a drunken sleep, it seemed—and he, Mr. Jay, had to bawl for some time, and
                  strike the chaise with his whip, before he could awake the man, who at last, with
                  a growl and a curse, drove on. He believed, but would not like to positively
                  swear, that the postillion he had heard examined was that man. This testimony,
                  strongly suggestive as it was, his lordship opined did not materially affect the
                  case; the jury concurred, and a verdict of guilty was pronounced and recorded
                  amidst the death-like silence of a hushed and anxious auditory.
               The unfortunate convict staggered visibly beneath the blow, fully expected as it
                  must have been, and a terrible spasm convulsed his features, and shook his frame.
                  It passed away; and his bearing and speech, when asked what he had to say why
                  sentence of death should not be pronounced according to law, was not without a
                  certain calm dignity and power, whilst his tones, tremulous it is true, were
                  silvery and unassuming as a child's.
               "I cannot blame the gentlemen of the jury," he said. "Their fatal verdict is, I am
                  sure, as conscientious as God and myself know it to be erroneous—false!
                  Circumstances are, I feel, strangely arrayed against me; and it has been my fate
                  through life to be always harshly judged, save only by one whose truth and
                  affection have shed over my chequered existence the only happiness it has ever
                  known. I observed, too, the telling sneer of the prosecuting counsel, connecting
                  the circumstances under which I left the navy with the cowardice of
                  the deed of which I stand here accused—convicted, I suppose I should say. I
                  forgive that gentleman his cruel sneer as freely as I do you, gentlemen of the
                  jury, your mistaken verdict—you, my lord, the death sentence you are about to
                  pronounce. The manner in which I hope to pass through the brief, but dark and
                  bitter passage lying betwixt me and the grave, will, I trust, be a sufficient
                  answer to the taunt of cowardice; and the future vindication of my innocence, not
                  for my own, but my wife and children's sake, I confidently leave to him into whose
                  hands I shall soon, untimely, render up my spirit. This is all I have to say."
               The prisoner's calm, simple, unhurried words produced a marvellous effect upon the
                  court and auditory. The judge, Chief Baron Macdonald, a conscientious and somewhat
                  nervous man, paused in the act of assuming the black-cap, and presently said,
                  rather hastily, "Let the prisoner be removed; I will pass sentence to-morrow." The
                  court then immediately adjourned.
               I was miserably depressed in spirits, which the cold, sleety weather that greeted
                  us on emerging from the hot and crowded court considerably increased. I was
                  thinking—excuse the seeming pathos—I was only a clerk, and used to such tragedies;
                  I was thinking, I say, that a glass of brandy-and-water might not be amiss, when
                  whom should I rudely jostle against but Cyclops, alias Thomas Burnham. He was going the same way as myself, in
                  prodigious haste, his eye bright and flaming as a live coal, and his whole manner
                  denoting intense excitement. "Is that you?" he broke out. "Come along, then, and
                  quick, for the love of God! I've missed Sims and his clerk, but you'll do as well,
                  perhaps better." I had no power, if I had the inclination, to refuse, for the
                  enthusiastic man seized me by the arm, and hurried me along, at a tremendous rate,
                  towards the outskirts of the city. "This is the place," he exclaimed, as he burst
                  into a tavern parlor, where two trunks had been deposited. "He's not come yet,"
                  Burnham went on, "but the coach is to call for him here. He thinks to be off for
                  London this very night."
               "Whom are you talking of? Who's off to London tonight?"
               
               "James Berry, if he's clever enough! Look there!"
               "I see; 'James Berry, passenger, London.' These, then, are his trunks, I
                  suppose?"
               "Right, my boy; but there is nothing of importance in them. Sly,
                  steady-going Margery has well ascertained that. You know Margery—but hush! here he
                  comes."
               Berry—it was he—could not repress a nervous start, as he unexpectedly encountered
                  Burnham's burly person and fierce glare.
               "You here!" he stammered, as he mechanically took a chair by the fire. "Who would
                  have thought it!"
               "Not you, Jim, I'm sure; it must be, therefore, an unexpected pleasure. I've come
                  to have a smoke and a bit of chat with you, Berry—there isn't a riper berry than
                  you are in the kingdom—before you go to London, Jim—do you mark?—before you go to
                  London. Ha, ha! ho, ho! But, zounds! how pale and shaky you're looking, and before
                  this rousing fire, too! D—n thee, villain!" shouted Burnham, jumping suddenly up
                  from his chair, and dashing his pipe to fragments on the floor. "I can't play with
                  thee any longer. Tell me—when did the devil teach thee to stuff coat collars with
                  the spoils of murdered men, eh?"
               A yell of dismay escaped Berry, and he made a desperate rush to get past
                  Burnham—but in vain. The fierce publican caught him by the throat, and held him by
                  a grip of steel. "You're caught, scoundrel! nicked, trapped, found out, and by
                  whom, think you? Why, by deaf, paralytic Margery, whose old eyes have never
                  wearied in watching you from the hour you slew and robbed her good old master till
                  to-day, when you dreamed yourself alone, and she discovered the mystery of the
                  coat collar."
               "Let me go!" gasped the miscreant, down whose pallid cheeks big drops of agony
                  were streaming. "Take all, and let me go."
               A fierce imprecation, followed by a blow, replied to the despairing felon. A
                  constable, attracted by the increasing uproar, soon arrived; the thick coat collar
                  was ripped, and in it were found a considerable sum in Exeter notes, the ruby
                  ring, and other valuables well known to have belonged to Mr. Bradshaw. Berry was
                  quickly lodged in gaol. A true bill was returned the next day by the grand jury
                  before noon, and by the time the clock struck four, the murderer was, on his own
                  confession, convicted of the foul crime of which a perfectly innocent man had
                  been, not many hours before, pronounced guilty! A great lesson this was felt to be
                  at the time in Exeter, and in the western country generally. A lesson of the
                  watchfulness of providence over innocent lives; of rebuke to the self-sufficing
                  infallibility of men, however organized or empanelled; and of patience under
                  unmerited obloquy and slander.
               Edward Drysdale was, I need hardly say, liberated by the king's pardon—pardon for
                  an uncommitted offence; and he, and his true-hearted wife, the heiress of her
                  uncle, are still living, I believe, in competence, content, and harmony.
            
            
               
               The Story of the Unfinished Picture.
               A GERMAN ARTIST'S TALE, BY CHARLES HOOTON, ESQ.
               WEIGEL was an intimate acquaintance of mine,—a good painter, and had commenced his
                  career promisingly. Calculating on a fortune not yet made and a reputation that
                  still had to take root, although it put forth strongly, he married a handsome girl
                  of poor and obscure parentage, and found himself involved in all the cares of a
                  young family almost before he was three-and-twenty. Fortune seemed to abandon him
                  almost from the very day of his wedding, and from hard experience he soon found
                  that he had begun the world too soon. But he was ambitious to an excess, and
                  frequently used to say to his acquaintance that he could willingly lay down his
                  life, only to become an artist that the world would never forget. Nay, I have
                  often heard him say he was in the nightly habit of invoking the aid, in prayers,
                  of either good spirits or bad (he cared not which), whichever, if such existed,
                  would come first to assist him in the attainment of a painter's success and
                  immortality. "What matters," said he, "even if a man could give away
                  his immortality in the uncertain hereafter, for a certain immortality here, though
                  he should go so far as to do it? 'Twould be but an exchange of equivalents."
               Thus he used to think and talk, and every day getting poorer and poorer as the
                  demands of his family increased, and his own unwearied exertions failed to meet
                  with reward:—a state of things, I fear, which went far to induce his peculiar
                  belief. I have often seen him in a fearful burst of passionate excitement when his
                  wife and family and himself were in want of the most ordinary necessaries, cast
                  some fine unsold picture into the fire and swear most solemnly and deeply, that if
                  there were a devil, and if he himself had a soul worth the devil's purchase, he
                  would sell it him in bonds of fire and blood, if the price would but redeem their
                  present misery, and find all that he most loved on earth in even as much food for
                  their wants as God could find for the wild wolf and the raven, without toil,
                  without the chance of an immortality to risk, without heart or intellect to feel
                  privation as he felt it, even should it come upon them. He would then turn
                  suddenly to me and exclaim, "Now, Zeitter, if these idle tales were true, why does
                  this Evil One not come? Why not take me at my word? for he must know that in this
                  I am no liar."
               At that time he occupied two small rooms on the upper story of a large old house
                  in Heidelburg, the door of the outer one of which opened upon a common staircase
                  and passage, in which he usually paced up and down with a large pipe in his mouth
                  during several hours in the gloom of an evening, for the sake of fresher air and
                  exercise, and perhaps also to dissipate, if possible, his miserable reflections.
                  He also used to do the same at any time of the night when he could not sleep. He
                  would rise in the dark from the side of his sleeping wife and children, fill his
                  huge meerschaum pipe, light a tinder to fire his tobacco, and then stalk backwards and forwards in the blind
                  passage with steps as noiseless as a ghost, and exactly as confident, calm, and
                  unapprehensive as though in the summer sunshine of a public road. I do not say
                  there was anything to be frightened at, but my imagination would never allow me
                  exactly to fancy his particular taste in that respect.
               [At this part of his story Zeitter charged his audience to mark particularly that
                  he was not giving them opinions nor speculations.]
               "I am speaking of facts and results," said he, "of things I have seen and heard,
                  and therefore known; make of them what you can or will."
               One morning I walked into his chambers just to chat about the news of the day—for
                  there had been a terrible storm in the night, and a church spire rent from top to
                  bottom by the lightning—when I found him intently engaged upon a new picture, a
                  fact which somewhat surprised me by the waywardness of temper it displayed, as he
                  had thrown down his pencils in vexation but the afternoon before, and vowed never
                  to touch them again, but buy a spade, and go and earn his bread like Cain, by the
                  sweat of his brow.
               "Ah, Weigel," said I, "how is this? At it once more, as I knew you would be before
                  another sun went round."
               "Yes," he replied, "I took good advice last night."
               I told him I was glad to hear it, for the arts would have had reason to deplore
                  his wild resolution of yesterday, if he had adhered to it. I then asked him what
                  friend had had the good fortune so to influence him?
               "Why," he replied, "you know how it thundered between twelve and three o'clock? I
                  could not sleep, so I got up, lit my pipe, and took my old walk in the passage.
                  Crash came the thunder-claps on the roof, and the lightning flew about me like the
                  blazes of a burning house. It might have withered me to ashes, for what I cared,
                  since I neither hoped here nor feared hereafter. I had nearly smoked my pipe out,
                  when a man met me in the passage, and as is usual with the people here, just
                  inquired how I was coming on. I told him my resolve, and added that I intended to
                  keep it. He said as you say, that it would be a pity to see such a poetical soul
                  as mine reduced to the necessity of spending time in common labor that any peasant
                  hind might do as well or better, just for the sake of finding food and shelter for
                  myself and family. I answered that that soul so constituted had been my curse, and
                  swore the devil might have it if it were of any use to him, providing I could keep
                  the bodies of those who were dependent on me from starvation worse than that of
                  the beasts. He begged me not to speak rashly, but advised me to take heart and try
                  once more. 'Go to your easel to-morrow,' said he, 'you will find a subject ready
                  in your own room. I will make a bargain with you; you shall work upon it as long
                  as you fancy you can improve it; if you finish it any time within one exact
                  year—even a moment within—I will buy it of you at a price that will make your
                  fortune, on condition that if you do not, at the expiration of that time, you take
                  leave of your family and walk away into the forest with me when I call for you.'
                  Done! said I, a bargain! And can you believe it, Zeitter, I fancied that I heard
                  that word a bargain, a bargain, a bargain, repeated by twenty different echoes? We
                  shook hands and parted. I filled my pipe again, and walked about till the storm
                  was over."
               I then, continued Zeitter, asked Weigel who the man was. He said that he could not
                  tell, as he never troubled himself to look particularly either where he came from
                  or whither he went. "And the subject that you were to find in your own room?" said
                  I, glancing upon his new, clear canvas—"is this it?" "That is it," answered he, "for though when I sat down I did
                  not think what I was going to be about, yet half-unconsciously I began to draw
                  that portrait. But the most odd thing about it is, that as I advanced with it,
                  thinking I was sketching from fancy only, I happened to cast my eyes into the dark
                  corner beside my easel, and there I saw the identical face looking through the
                  gloom at me!"
               "Exactly so," remarked Stretcher,—"and you saw it as well, no doubt?"
               "Not so," answered Zeitter,—"but as I looked on my friend, I concluded that misery
                  had made him mad."
               "Pretty shrewd guess, that. Well, go on, old fellow. What sort of a picture was
                  it?"
               There was nothing but a rude outline then, but afterwards, as it seemed to grow
                  towards perfection under his hands, it struck the spectator at first view as the
                  highest conceivable manly beauty of an ethereal nature—a picture of a being whose
                  very outward form was spiritual, yet heightened by a still deeper expression of
                  remoter spirituality that made the heart quail as though standing before the
                  presence of a very angel. But as you continued to gaze, that feeling grew
                  imperceptibly into one of fear, you knew not how or why; and then again, and at
                  last, into a sense of utter dread and horror; for the beauty seemed to become
                  spiritually sinful, and what appeared to be an angel to the sight sank into the
                  soul like the blighting presence of a demon. Never, continued Zeitter, shall I get
                  that picture from before my eyes; for against it even Raffaelle and Correggio were
                  tame. After three months' incessant labor, I thought it was finished, for so it
                  seemed to all eyes save Weigel's: but, on and on, he still worked as incessantly
                  as before, for he said that the longer he went on, the more did his visionary
                  model increase in beauty, and expression, and finish:—the labor of a lifetime was
                  before him—not of a year only; and even then he should drop into his grave and
                  leave it still an "unfinished picture."
               After six months' toil, he fell sick from anxiety and incessant application, but
                  still persisted in his labor. He said that the work grew under his hands, for the
                  further he proceeded, the more he had to do: a year seemed now but a day, and yet
                  he had but six months left. Only six months to do all, or lose all. The
                  consciousness of this pressed heavily upon him, and incited him to labor even when
                  he almost required to be supported on his seat before his easel. At the end of
                  three hundred and sixty days he was worn to a shadow, while the picture was
                  wrought up to such a wonderful pitch of perfection that it seemed the
                  living palpable reality, and he, the workman, only such a dim animated shade as
                  human art and earthly colors might produce. Together they looked like spirit
                  creating matter;—the invisible making the visible,—the supernatural and visionary
                  giving form, and bulk, and substance to sensitive material. But what struck me as
                  most singular was, that during the whole of this time he had never even once again
                  alluded to the strange speculation which previously (as I described at the setting
                  out) appeared to occupy so great a portion of his thoughts. He did so, at length,
                  in the following manner:—
               "Look what I have done, Zeitter, my friend. Behold this picture. Will it make a
                  man immortal? But it is well you cannot see the original. I know that
                  no man in this world may truly see him and live. That accursed, glorious, and yet
                  hideous shadow! It has blasted me with poring upon. Night and day; day and night
                  alike. Dream and reality, light and darkness; all have been alike to me; still the
                  same unchangeably, until my eyes know no other object than that everlasting one.
                  His look has become a part of my existence, and if I do not haste, make haste—I
                  have but five days and some odd hours left,—I feel that he will swallow low me up, body and soul! But I will be
                  diligent; I will escape him yet; five days are a long time; and if I am in the
                  hands of the Evil One—if, I say, all I have doubted be true, I'll finish in five
                  days, five hours and a half, and cheat the devil of his prize at last."
               I endeavored to persuade him that the picture was more than finished already,—that
                  in pure plain truth the world possessed not such another; and that he had better
                  so consider it himself, and lay his palette down for the close of labor. But he
                  could not be convinced that it was finished. "Besides," said he, "he
                  has not yet come to purchase it, the time is not yet up. One moment within the
                  year, exactly, and he will be here. I know he will, for I feel him as it were even
                  now creeping through my blood and along my bones," and he shivered in agony as the
                  pencil fell from his hands, and his whole form sank almost as senseless as a
                  corpse back in his antique chair.
               In spite of even the daily conclusions of my own senses, that nothing more within
                  the reach of the most consummate art could possibly be done to heighten the
                  picture,—what actually was done day after day contradicted me, and
                  showed again and again, that Weigel was right;—it was yet unfinished, because a
                  higher perfection seemed still attainable, though attainable only because the eye
                  constantly distinguished that he did it again.
               Five days and five hours more were gone. The conclusion was at hand. Curious and
                  anxious to know what it would be, I was alone by his side from the commencement of
                  the last hour until all was over. I know not how to describe it, for my own
                  excitement was such, that the circumstances, impressions, and feelings of that
                  time seemed to whirl through my brain confusedly and indistinctly, like objects
                  mingled together on the circumference of a revolving wheel. I knew a climax of
                  some sort was at hand, and one all the more impressive and fearful, because though
                  so close, it was inscrutable, though involving beyond doubt the fate of a man of a
                  most gifted and rare genius. Weigel hung his watch upon the easel above his
                  picture, while his eye, with painful regularity, and an expression of intensity,
                  that seemed to dilate the pupil much beyond its ordinary size, while it partially
                  closed the lids and drew down the brows closely and rigidly—passed from the moving
                  hands to the dark corner where his supernatural model was, and then to the
                  picture:—only to return while touch was added to touch to the shadow again, to the
                  picture, and then to the dial. His mouth was slightly opened in an indescribable
                  expression of agony and fear, and whenever his pencil was not actually in contact
                  with the palette or the painting, I observed it tremble in his grasp like a
                  shivering reed.
               "Five minutes more!" at length he gasped; "and the head grows more and more
                  glorious, till this picture looks but a school-boy's sketch! Three minutes!—I
                  shall never have done, never! One minute!—Ah!—not one—not half a one! Zeitter,
                  Zeitter!—my friend!" he shrieked; "ah!—ah!—ah!—the year is out, and
                  it is not done!"
               The palette and pencils fell from his hands to the floor, and his head sank
                  heavily upon his breast, as though bowed even in death before the idol of his art.
                  I flew to seize and support him, for he was apparently insensible. At that moment
                  his wife and a strange man, whom I had never seen before, entered the room. The
                  former wept and cried like a woman frantic; but the latter looked coldly on, and
                  placing his finger on Weigel's breast merely said solemnly, "He is better now." At
                  that voice and touch the artist raised himself up, as though suddenly re-animated,
                  and looked seriously, but confidently and calmly, in the face of the stranger. Not
                  a word passed between them; but the latter turned towards Weigel's wife, and told
                  her that at a certain bank in the city,
                  which he named, she would find payment for that picture to the amount of three
                  thousand pounds.
               "It will at least," said he, "save you and your family from want for life; and
                  that is all your husband cares for."
               "All!—all!" said Weigel; "and now for the forest!"
               So saying he arose with the alacrity of a youth whose health and spirits the world
                  has never broken; put on his cap, filled his pipe as though nothing had happened,
                  and kissed his wife and children, after having extorted a promise from them to be
                  happy until he came back again.
               "I will see that they fulfil it!" murmured the stranger. "Come!—the moon is up and
                  we must be there by midnight."
               "May I not accompany you, Weigel?" I exclaimed.
               "No!—not as you value your life;—and take heed, Zeitter, take heed, also, that you
                  never come to me."
               Nevertheless, I felt impelled to go along with them, and followed until we entered
                  the shadows of the forest. Two black horses, or creatures that bore their
                  resemblance, stood in the road.
               "Mount!" cried the stranger, as he vaulted on to the back of one, and Weigel on
                  the other; "DARKNESS is mine, and RUIN thine! Away, away!"
               They swept the forest like a Winter's blast; bowing the trees as they passed,
                  sweeping leaves away like a hurricane, and gathering a tempest of black hurrying
                  clouds from the skies along the horizon towards which they fled. The moon sank
                  like an opaque scarlet fire, and the hair of my head stood up as I returned home
                  in darkness. Need I say that Weigel never came back again?
               Here Herr Zeitter paused.
               "And the picture,—did they take that too?" asked Sapio Green.
               "The picture," replied Zeitter, "was sent for the next day by a strange old baron,
                  who inhabited a castle hard by, and who said he had purchased it by commission.
                  However that might be, his name was on the check for payment, and the bank
                  discharged it out of his deposits. I anticipate your next question, but he was not
                  the stranger; nor was any one like him known in that quarter of the country. Up to
                  this day, however, it is believed that a figure like Weigel may be seen on
                  moonlight nights still working away with his shadowy pencils upon the 'Unfinished
                  Picture,' as it hangs in distinguished state in a room appropriated (with
                  reference to works of art) to it alone."
            
            The End.
