                        Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle,

                  CHAPTER I.
                  In a large, brilliantly illuminated room in the palace at St. Petersburgh, were
                     seated two persons. The first was a man of tall, commanding presence. He was
                     dressed in the uniform of a Russian general, with this exception, that his
                     epaulettes were formed of black cord, instead of gold. The hilt of his sword
                     was also black. On the middle finger of his left hand he wore a signet ring. It
                     needed but a slight pressure of that ring to sign the death warrant of any one,
                     or what was worse, to consign him to the icy regions of Siberia. Need we say
                     that this man was the Emperor Nicholas of Russia.
                  The other was a man of medium height. He appeared to be about forty-three or
                     four years of age. He, too, was attired in the dress of a Russian general, but
                     his dress was far more gaudy than that of the Emperor's. His manner betokened
                     restlessness, and a mind ill at ease. Whenever he caught the Emperor's eye
                     fixed on him, he quailed and dropped his eyes to the floor. Thus stood these
                     two great men: the one a tyrant, the other a general.
                  "So," said the Emperor, as he walked rapidly across the room, "you say he has
                     escaped?"
                  "No, your Majesty. I said that we failed to arrest him."
                  On hearing this, the Emperor strode towards the speaker, and fixing his eagle
                     eye on him, he said:—
                  "Do I know the meaning of the word fail?"
                  
                  "Your Majesty," said the other, entreatingly, "I have never failed before."
                  The Emperor walked slowly backwards, and touching the signet with his finger,
                     he said—"Beware!"
                  On hearing that single word, Gortschakoff sank slowly into a chair, and drawing
                     a handkerchief from his pocket, he wiped the heavy drops of perspiration from
                     his brow.
                  "Remember," said the Emperor, as he again pointed to the signet, "I never
                     forgive the second time. If, by to-morrow morning, Charles Handermoff is not
                     brought before me, Siberia receives another exile," and again murmuring the
                     word "beware," he left the room.
                  For a moment the general remained as though paralyzed.
                  "God!" cried he, as he sank from the chair to the floor, "what can I do?
                     Escape! Ha! the thought is a good one," and he sprang from the floor and walked
                     rapidly to the window. "There is no escape," he muttered, in a voice of agony.
                     "Fool that I was to think it. Who can escape—who has ever escaped the Emperor's
                     wrath? The Emperor, did I say? Rather let it be the tyrant."
                  "Have it what you will," said a voice near him. Gortschakoff turned and beheld
                     the Emperor standing near him.
                  "I have changed my mind," said the Emperor, in a fearfully distinct voice.
                     "Should you fail, instead of exile, your reward shall be the knout and the
                     axe," and again pointing to the signet, he left the room.
                  "The knout!" cried Gortschakoff. "No, no, not the knout. How can I save myself
                     from this indignity! Ha! I have it," and drawing forth his dagger, he raised it
                     high above his head. For a moment he held it thus, and then dropped it.
                  "I am a coward," he muttered, hoarsely. "I dare not die—and yet why should I
                     die? Fortune may not have deserted me. I have ten hours before me, and what may
                     not a man do in that time, especially when that man is striving against fate
                     for his life?"
                  At this moment the door opened and a man entered.
                  "Ha! Thulong, what is it? cried Gortschakoff, springing forward.
                  "We have discovered some clue to the whereabouts of Handermoff," replied the
                     man.
                  "What! is it so?" cried Gortschakoff, joyfully. "Thulong, you have saved me
                     from the knout, and you have made your fortune. Where is he?"
                  "In the old mill by the river—at least we were so informed. The information may
                     be false after all."
                  "Order Major Wyckoff to get out his company," said Gortschakoff. "I will
                     accompany him to the mill. Tell him that if he succeeds in capturing this young
                     man, I will promote him before the week is passed. And now, let us away," and
                     throwing his cloak over his shoulder, Gortschakoff and his aid left, the
                     palace.
                  Let us take the reader to the old mill by the river.
                  In a small, dimly lighted room, were seated two persons. We will describe them
                     as we go along.
                  "And so my place of concealment has been discovered," said a tall, good looking
                     young man, who was seated by the fire. As he is the hero of our story, we must
                     describe him. His forehead was high and noble; his eyes were of a deep black;
                     and his hair of a chestnut shade. He was attired in the uniform of a Russian
                     captain, although the clothes seemed to set ill upon him, as though he were not
                     used to wearing them. His complexion was very dark, too much so for one to take
                     him for a Russian. On the table standing near him were two large pistols and a
                     sabre.
                  "It is so," replied the other, an old man, who appeared to be some seventy
                     years of age. As he spoke he eyed the other keenly, as though wishing to
                     observe what effect the words had on him.
                  "And think you that they will come for me to-night?" asked the young man.
                  "It is hard to tell, Monvau," replied the other.
                  "Call me by my real name, Stractkoff," said the young man. "The assumed name of
                     Monvau sets but illy on me. Would that I were safe in my own country."
                  "Walls may have ears," said the old man, gazing around him. "The minions of the
                     Emperor are everywhere; and for all we know, one or more of them may be near us
                     now. Hark! me-thought I heard some one at the door."
                  "Merely the wind," said the other. "But I'll make sure that there is no one
                     there," and seizing his sabre he sprang to the door and threw it open. Hardly
                     had he done so when the lamp was extinguished.
                  "Strike a light, Stractkoff," said the young man, as he groped his way across
                     the room towards the old man.
                  "Where is the tinder box?" asked the other.
                  Before the young man could reply, a hand was laid on his shoulder, and a stern
                     voice summoned him to surrender. With one blow of his sabre the young man
                     severed his enemy's hand from the wrist, and sprang towards the door. Ere he
                     could reach it a dozen men sprang upon him, and despite his struggles they bore
                     him to the floor. Hardly was this done when several men bearing torches in
                     their hand entered the room.
                  "And so we have you at last," said one of the men, the commander of the party. "Little did I think when
                     I set out on this expedition that I would return with but one hand."
                  A man, whose figure was concealed by a cloak, now entered the room. On seeing
                     the prisoner, he uttered a cry of joy.
                  "We have succeeded," said Wyckoff, holding up his arm. "The only thing that
                     consoles me for the loss of my hand, is your promise of promotion."
                  "And I will keep my word," said the other, who, as the reader may already have
                     suspected, was Gortschakoff. "Take the prisoner to the palace. Do not suffer
                     him to speak, and see that no one approaches him;" and saying this he turned
                     towards the door.
                  "General Gortschakoff," said the prisoner, "suffer me to ask you one question,
                     and I pledge you my honor that I will not speak to any one, unless it be in
                     answer to your questions."
                  "Speak then," said the general.
                  "Who betrayed me?" asked the young man.
                  "I do not know," replied Gortschakoff.
                  The prisoner pointed to the old man. "Did he betray me?" he asked.
                  "I can answer your question," said Major Wyckoff, stepping forward." One of my
                     men saw you enter this house, and he immediately informed me."
                  "The miller, then, did not betray me?" said the prisoner, interrogatively.
                  "The miller," repeated Wyckoff, in surprise. "What miller?"
                  The prisoner turned towards the place where the old man had been standing, but
                     he had disappeared. A look of surprise stole over his features.
                  "Who, then, was that old man who stood near me when you entered the room?" he
                     asked.
                  "I do not know," replied Wyckoff. "It was not the miller, of that I am certain,
                     for I know him well. Search the house, men. For all we know he may be a
                     spy."
                  Several of the men immediately left the room. In a few minutes they
                     returned.
                  "He has escaped," they said, in answer to the major's inquiring look.
                  "At any rate we have got what we came for," said the major; "and now,
                     forward."
                  Again we take the reader to the palace. In the same room where we saw him
                     before, stood the Emperor. At a little distance from him stood several of his
                     officers with uncovered heads. Suddenly the door opened, and General
                     Gortschakoff entered. He was followed by several soldiers bringing with them
                     the prisoner. With a haughty curl of the lip, and an unshaken brow, the latter
                     stood before the Emperor, whom no man could look in the face without
                     trembling.
                  "The prisoner, Charles Handermoff, your Majesty," said General
                     Gortschakoff.
                  "It is well," said the Emperor. "The knout which we had reserved for you shall
                     be given to the man who now stands before us—that is, if he is proven guilty;"
                     and saying this, the Emperor fixed his eagle eye on the prisoner.
                  "Of what crime am I accused?" asked the prisoner, boldly.
                  "He speaks our language well, too well" muttered the Emperor to himself—"and
                     yet, I forgot. Report says that he was brought up amongst us. The dark
                     complexion, those features, every thing about him shows that he belongs not to
                     our faith."
                  "Your Majesty," said the prisoner, "of what crime am I accused?"
                  "Your name?" asked the Emperor.
                  "Men call me Monvau," was the reply.
                  "Your real name?" asked the Emperor.
                  "Charles Handermoff."
                  "Your birthplace?"
                  "Constantinople," replied the prisoner, proudly.
                  "Your religion?"
                  "The crescent. I am a follower of the true faith. I believe that there is but
                     one God, and that Mahomet is his prophet. I am a Mahometan."
                  On hearing this the Emperor crossed himself. The others, with the exception of
                     the prisoner, did the same.
                  "You are then a Turk?"
                  "I am, both in birth and religion."
                  Why are you here?"
                  "Ask your men, they brought me here. I came against my own will."
                  "What reasons have you for visiting this country?" asked the Emperor.
                  The prisoner made no reply.
                  The Emperor made a threatening gesture with his fingers. The prisoner looked at
                     him with a smile of scorn.
                  "Answer me," cried the Emperor.
                  The prisoner folded his arms and made no reply.
                  "What, dog! dare you beard me here?" cried the Emperor, unable to restrain his
                     passion.
                  "Dare!" cried the prisoner, the red blood mantling to his cheek. "Aye! I do
                     dare,—Emperor though you are, the Turk scorns you. Listen to the words of one
                     who is looked upon as a prophet among his own people. The war in which you are
                     now about to engage will be your last. In a year you will be without a throne,
                     a beggar upon the earth! the cursed of God and man! You will be looked upon as the murderer
                     of millions. Your armies may cross the Danube, but they will never return, for
                     the Turks have sworn upon the grave of Mahomet to spare none! The war that you
                     are now creating, will, instead of a curse, prove a blessing, for it will give
                     freedom to millions! Count not upon the aid of others. Prussia will not help
                     you; Austria dare not, and the nations whom you count the most on, instead of
                     fighting for you, will fight against you. Already, France and England have
                     joined together, and soon their armies will be here to do you battle. The
                     Cossacks of the plains will fight against you. The mountaineers of Circassia
                     have offered us their aid. Your destiny has been written; it cannot be changed.
                     Powerful when young, powerless when old! Like one stricken with some dread
                     disease you will wander over the earth. No one will dare to help the
                     ex-emperor. Millions will shout with joy over your degradation, and none will
                     mourn the fate of the once powerful Nicholas of Russia!"
                  He paused. So surprised were his hearers that for a few moments not a word was
                     spoken. Nicholas was the first to recover from his surprise, but ere he could
                     speak, the Turk again spoke.
                  "You have asked me my reasons for coming here. I will tell you, but believe me,
                     it is not from fear that I do it. I left my sunny land for this cold clime to
                     discover your plans. I have succeeded, and ere now the plans of your
                     fortifications, the number of your men, and, in fact, everything that you
                     intend to do, are in the hands of the Sultan. Nicholas, if one Turk can do all
                     this, what may not a million do?"
                  "We shall see," said the Emperor. "Take this man to the darkest and deepest
                     dungeon of the prison: chain him hand and foot; and hark ye, Major Wyckoff, I
                     place him under your guard. If he escapes, the knout and the axe shall be
                     yours."
                  The major made a low bow; and at a signal from him, his men surrounded the
                     prisoner. With slow and solemn steps they left the room, and descended the
                     stairs to the street. Ten minutes' walk brought them to the prison. The major
                     tapped on the gate with the handle of his sword, and then awaited impatiently
                     for it to open.
                  "So this is to be my residence," said the prisoner, with a bitter smile. "How
                     long am I to remain here?"
                  Before any one could reply, a loud hooting like the crying of an owl was heard.
                     Before any one could prevent him, the prisoner had answered it three times.
                  "Be prepared, men, for an attack," cried the major.
                  "Calm your fears," said the prisoner, "there will be no attack. Ah!" he
                     muttered to himself, "I little thought that I had friends so near me."
                  The gates were now opened, and the party entered the prison. After ascending
                     and descending several pair of stairs, they stopped before a large iron door.
                     The major drew a large key from his pocket and inserted it into the lock. He
                     then tried to turn it but was unsuccessful.
                  "This door has been opened so seldom that the lock has grown rusty," said the
                     major.
                  "Let me try it," said Handermoff. "Two hands are better than one."
                  "Try it then," said the major, standing back.
                  Handermoff laid his hands upon the key, and apparently tried with all his
                     strength to push it back.
                  "I have so little room," said he, "that I can do nothing."
                  "Stand back, men, and give him a little elbow room," said the major.
                  So the men obeyed the order. Handermoff thrust his hand into his bosom, and
                     drawing forth a small phial he pushed it into the key hole. So rapidly was this
                     done, that the men saw it not.
                  "Well, have you succeeded?" asked Wyckoff.
                  "Yes," replied Handermoff, as he gave the key a sudden turn. The door flew open
                     and they entered the cell.
                  "What, is this to be my prison?" cried Handermoff, as he gazed around on the
                     bare walls. "Why there is not even a bed for me to lie on. I cannot live in
                     such a place?"
                  "Better, far better that you should die here than meet the Emperor again," said
                     Wyckoff. "Besides, a bed could be of no use to you. You forget that you are to
                     be chained hand and foot."
                  "Truly, I forgot," said the other; "but surely you will not execute the order
                     of your cruel master."
                  "I must," said Wyckoff. "I dread the knout too much to disobey him."
                  Without uttering a single word, the prisoner suffered his hands and feet to be
                     chained. When this was done, the soldiers left him, locking the door behind
                     them.
                  "Could I but get these chains off my hands," murmured Handermoff, "I would call
                     myself a free man. The inside of the lock is already destroyed. Little do they
                     think that I can press back the bolt with my finger. Nitric acid acts very
                     quick on rusty iron."
                  The thoughts of the prisoner now took another turn.
                  "Who was that that signaled to me just now? Perhaps it was Achemet. If so, I am
                     saved," and murmuring a few words more he fell asleep.
                  Several hours passed ere he was awakened by the bolt turning in the lock. The
                     light of a torch flashed upon his face. Thinking it was the jailor, he turned
                     his head towards the door. To his great surprise he beheld Stractkoff.
                  "Hush," said the latter, placing his fingers on his lip. "I have good news for you,
                     news that will revive your drooping spirits."
                  "Who are you?" said Handermoff. "I know you only under the name of Stractkoff.
                     Is that your real name or an assumed one?"
                  "Look;" cried the latter, holding the torch close to his face, and throwing off
                     his false beard. With a cry of astonishment, Handermoff ejaculated "Omer
                     Pacha."
                  "Hush," cried the other, as he bent his ear towards the floor. After listening
                     several moments, he turned to Handermoff.
                  "I am indeed your general," he said; "and I have come to save you. Without the
                     gate there is waiting one whose name would put the strength of a thousand men
                     in your single arm. Need I tell her name?"
                  "Her name!" cried Handermoff. "What, can it be Marritta?"
                  "Yes it is Marritta. But you must not see her now. The meeting would be too
                     much for your exhausted strength to bear. Believe me, I would gladly consent to
                     your meeting, but it must be otherwise."
                  "And can I not escape from hence?"
                  "No, it is impossible. It would take five hours to remove the chains even if I
                     had a file."
                  "But I have the means, "cried Handermoff, eagerly. "Nitric acid will eat away
                     the iron."
                  "But these chains are of steel, and nitric acid will not act on steel."
                  "So there is no hope," murmured Handermoff.
                  "Yes, there is hope," cried Pacha. To morrow you will be removed from this
                     dungeon to the one at Pskov. On the road we will rescue you."
                  "We" repeated Handermoff, eagerly.
                  "Yes, we," replied the other. Achemet and a small party of men are in the woods
                     just outside of the city. The Russians, not suspecting an attack, will be
                     defeated; and then we will have you safe amongst us again."
                  "How did you gain admittance into the prison?" asked Handermoff.
                  "Very easily. I bribed the jailor."
                  "But he may betray you."
                  "No, he will not," said Pacha. "I promised him a hundred sequins when I stood
                     safe outside the gate."
                  "Perhaps for a larger sum he would unlock these chains," said Handermoff.
                  "I have tried him on that point," said Pacha; "but he has not the keys. They
                     are in the possession of Major Wyckoff."
                  How I long to be free," said Handermoff, with a sigh.
                  "Free you shall be," said the other. "When the sun sets tomorrow, you will
                     either be a free man or I shall be dead."
                  
                     
                        JARDINE & HOLTON N.Y.
                     
                  
                  
                  "No, no," said Handermoff, eagerly: "rather let me die than that you should
                     peril your life for my sake. Remember, the Sultan has need of you."
                  "By heavens!" said Pacha, "your words only make me the more determined; and I
                     am more than half resolved to attempt your freedom this night. Yes," he
                     continued, speaking to himself, "it would, indeed, be a bold act for me to
                     attack this prison. It would give the Turks the more courage to think that they
                     have for their commander, a man who dared to attempt the liberation of a
                     fellow-soldier in the very heart of the Emperor's dominions—in fact, within one
                     hundred yards of the Emperor himself—and that too with but twenty men. I'll do
                     it," and he strode towards the door.
                  "No, no," cried Hendermoff, as he attempted to rise, "do not attempt it. The
                     lives of a thousand like me are not worth yours. Think, the eyes of all Europe,
                     and indeed, America, are turned upon you. The hopes of the Sultan and the Turks
                     rest upon you. Think then, how they would curse me were you to die in
                     attempting my liberation."
                  "Still, it would be a glorious deed," said Pacha, "a deed worthy of the
                     fame—"
                  Before he could conclude the sentence the gaoler sprang into the room.
                  "Quick, quick—to the gate," said he, pushing Omar towards the door.
                  "Adieu, Handermoff," said Pacha, extinguishing the torch. "We meet to-morrow,"
                     and he left the room.
                  In vain did Handermoff close his eyes, he could not sleep. Impatiently he
                     awaited the coming of the morn. At length a single ray of light peeped through
                     the bars of his prison; he hailed it with a cry of joy. Soon the rising sun
                     shone full in his face. Several hours passed and no one appeared.
                  "I cannot bear this agony of suspense much longer," said he, as he attempted to
                     change his position. Hardly had the words been spoken when a heavy footstep was
                     heard approaching, and the door flew open. Handermoff raised his head and
                     beheld the Emperor.
                  For several moments both gazed at each other without speaking. At length, as
                     though tired of silence, the Emperor waved his hand, and Wyckoff entered.
                  "You have obeyed my orders to the very letter," said the Emperor. Unloosen his
                     chains."
                  Wyckoff drew a key from his pocket and did as he was desired.
                  "Handermoff," said the Emperor, "you have had a taste of our dungeons. Could
                     you remain here a week and live?"
                  "No," replied the young man, "three nights more and death would claim another
                     victim."
                  "This dungeon compared with one at Pskov is a paradise," said the Emperor. "It
                     remains wholly with you whether you are to occupy it or not."
                  Handermoff gazed at the Emperor with surprise.
                  "Suppose," said the Emperor, "that I were to offer you the commission of a
                     general: what would be your answer?"
                  "See you these bare walls? See you these chains? Breathe you the foul air of
                     this dungeon? Sooner would I rot in this living grave than accept your offer.
                     Aye, Nicholas of Russia, the Turk, poor and unknown as he is, spurns your
                     offer. Sooner than turn traitor to my God and country, I would endure the most
                     fearful agonies that your fertile brain can invent. Think not to make me change
                     my mind. No power on earth can do it, not even Nicholas of Russia."
                  "I have heard you patiently," said the Emperor, "and it is now my turn. Charles
                     Handermoff, I have sworn upon the grave of my father, to carry on the war with
                     Turkey, so long as I can raise an arm. I have sworn that your country shall be
                     mine. Remember, Nicholas of Russia knows not the meaning of the word fail. I
                     have more men and money than England and France can boast of. Your country is
                     impoverished. Your Sultan is without money. The Turks are cowards. How, then,
                     can you expect to carry on the war? and even should you succeed in defeating
                     me, your country will be worse off than she was before, for England and France
                     will divide the spoils, and most probably your Sultan will be left without a
                     house to shelter him, or a nation to support him."
                  "The United States will—"
                  "Do nothing. She is jealous of England. Already have they quarreled about the
                     island of Cuba. I, by the aid of my money and agents, will fan the quarrel into
                     a flame, and the flame into a war. Everything goes against you. Remember, I
                     have sworn to carry on the war, and nothing but death will cause me to break my
                     oath."
                  "Then death let it be!" cried Handermoff, as he sprang forward and drew the
                     Emperor's dagger from the sheath. To his surprise the Emperor made no attempt
                     to defend himself, and as he gave the blow he smiled.
                  "The fate of my ancestor told me to be prepared for assassins," said Nicholas,
                     as he opened his shirt and disclosed a coat of mail. "This attempt, young man,
                     has sealed your doom. Away with him to the dungeon at Pskov; and hark ye,
                     major, see that no food is given him. Let him die of starvation," and with a
                     cold smile he left the cell.
                  "You did wrong in attempting his life," said Wyckoff, as soon as the sound of
                     the Emperor's footsteps had died away.
                  "Would that I had succeeded," said Handermoff bitterly; "but never mind. Although my arm has failed, the arm
                     of another may not," and he sank upon the floor.
                  Wyckoff now left the room. Handermoff made no attempt to escape. The scenes of
                     the past hour had 
                        weakenened
                        weakened
                      him so much that he was unable to rise. Soon, Wyckoff, followed by
                     several soldiers, entered the cell.
                  "You must prepare for a journey," said Wyckoff. "I am sorry that you are under
                     my charge, for should you escape, my doom from that moment is sealed. Get up,
                     for we have a long distance to go and I prefer traveling by daylight than
                     darkness. Come, we must be moving."
                  "Lift me up," said the young man, as he attempted in vain to rise to his feet.
                     Pitying his condition, one of the soldiers drew out a flask of brandy, and
                     poured about one half the contents down his throat. In an instant Handermoff
                     felt like a new man.
                  "Thank you," said he to the soldier, "I can walk now."
                  "Forward, then," said Wyckoff, and they left the cell. On reaching the street,
                     Handermoff was accosted by the Emperor.
                  "Accept my offer ere it is too late," said he, "your answer, quick."
                  "The same as before," was the proud reply.
                  "You will regret this ere three days have passed," said the Emperor.
                  "I may, and I may not," said Handermoff as he mounted the horse that one of the
                     soldiers held by the bridle.
                  For a few minutes the Emperor silently examined the features of the prisoner,
                     as though hoping that he would change his mind at the last moment. Handermoff
                     returned the gaze with a smile of scorn. With a sudden effort to repress his
                     rising anger, the Emperor left the spot.
                  "Place the prisoner in the center, and keep him there," said Wyckoff, "and now,
                     forward!"
                  An hour's ride brought them to the outskirts of the city. Before them extended
                     a long line of unbroken woods, many miles in length. After proceeding many
                     miles in silence, Wyckoff spoke:
                  "These woods," said he, "extend over three hundred miles. We must travel at
                     least fifty miles before we reach our stopping place for the night."
                  "I presume," said Handermoff, "that this is not the first time that you have
                     traveled over this road."
                  "No, far from it," replied Wyckoff, and they rode along in silence. Handermoff
                     was too much engrossed with his own thoughts to break the silence.
                  Hardly had the sun disappeared in the west when they reached the stopping
                     place. It was an inn. The house was so old that it appeared in danger of
                     falling at any moment. As the horses stopped at the door, the mistress, a tall,
                     raw-boned, masculine looking woman, came forth.
                  "We wish to remain here for the night," said Wyckoff; "I bear the Emperor's
                     order. Look," and he drew a seal from his pocket.
                  "You are welcome," said the woman. "Houch," she cried, clapping her hands,
                  A short, fat, sleepy looking man came out, and without 
                        nttering
                        uttering
                      a word, or bestowing even a glance on the travelers, he proceeded to
                     water the horses.
                  "I perceive that you have lost a hand since you were here last," said the
                     woman; "How came you to lose it?"
                  "Ask that gentleman," said Wyckoff, pointing to Handermoff. On seeing him, the
                     woman made a slight start.
                  "How was it that Major Wyckoff lost his hand?" said the woman as she approached
                     our hero. "Here, take this," she whispered, as she thrust a paper into his
                     hand; "do not suffer any one to see it," and saying this she left him.
                  Handermoff approached the window and looked out. Seizing an opportunity, he
                     drew forth the paper and read:—
                  "Do not sleep to-night. Be prepared to move at the slightest signal. Your
                     friends are near you. O. P."
                  "Let them come when they will," said Handermoff to himself, and he turned from
                     the window and threw himself into a chair.
                  An hour passed ere the hostess announced that "supper was ready."
                  Handermoff ate but little. He made no reply to the numerous questions that
                     Wyckoff put to him. The hostess, too, tried to engage him in conversation, but
                     failed. When the meal was finished, Handermoff expressed a wish to retire.
                  "Where do you intend to put him to-night," asked Wyckoff, of the hostess, as
                     she was about to leave the room.
                  "In the usual place," replied the woman, with a strange smile. "No one can
                     escape from that room so long as the bars are strong, and my sleeping place is
                     beneath it."
                  "Lock him in and bring me the key," said Wyckoff, "or stay; I will go with you
                     and make sure that the prisoner is locked in," and he arose from his chair.
                  Hardly had he reached the staircase, when the report of a gun was heard, and he
                     fell to the floor. The soldiers started up in terror.
                  "Secure—the—prisoner," said Wyckoff, in a choking voice.
                  Several of the men sprang upon Handermoff, and bore him to the floor.
                  "Fasten—the door," murmured Wyckoff, as he laid his hand on the wound.
                  One of the men stepped forward to obey the order, but ere he could reach the door, another report was heard,
                     and with a loud cry of agony he fell dead upon the floor.
                  With terror stricken countenances, the soldiers gazed on each other. They felt
                     that they were doomed men. How to escape they knew not. Instinctively they
                     turned to their leader, as though hoping that he would aid them.
                  "I am dying, comrades," said Wyckoff, as he raised himself on his elbow, and
                     gazed wildly about him. Suddenly his head fell back—a convulsive movement—and
                     he was dead.
                  Handermoff now made a violent effort to throw off his assailants, and
                     succeeded; he then sprang to the door. Before he could reach it, it was burst
                     open, and twelve or fourteen men entered the room. Their dark complexions and
                     dresses showed that they were Turks.
                  "Cut them down? Spare none but the prisoner," cried the foremost, as with a
                     blow of his heavy sabre he cut down one of the Russians who attempted to
                     grapple with him.
                  With loud cries of "Il Allah! Il Allah!" the Turks rushed forward. In vain did
                     the Russians attempt to defend themselves; they were soon overpowered. As the
                     last one fell, one of the Turks seized a torch and applied it to the curtains.
                     In an instant the room was in a blaze.
                  "Their battle ground shall be their grave," cried the Turk who had set fire to
                     the room. "To the door, men, and permit none to leave the house excepting those
                     belonging to our company and Handermoff."
                  "And me," cried the hostess, as she sprang forward.
                  "True; I forgot you," said the Turk, and he followed his men from the house.
                     Hardly had they reached the green plat in front of the house when the hostess'
                     features turned as pale as death, and her lips trembled so that she could
                     scarcely speak.
                  "What is it?" asked one of the Turks, who saw by her manner that she wished to
                     speak to him.
                  The woman pointed to the house and attempted to reply. She could not; her
                     tongue was paralyzed with terror.
                  "What is it?" again cried the Turk: "speak, woman!"
                  The hostess seized him by the arm and pushed him towards the woods.
                  "Omer Pacha!" she cried, suddenly recovering the use of her tongue, "the house
                     is filled with powder and—"
                  Before she could proceed farther, a dull heavy sound, followed by a terrific
                     explosion, was heard. The house had blown up. All of the Turks, with the
                     exception of Omer Pacha and Handermoff were killed. The latter received a
                     severe blow in the face. The force of the explosion was so great that it caused
                     the ground to open several feet, and from the opening there burst a large
                     stream of water. Before the two men could get out of the way, the chasm had
                     been filled up, and the water was rapidly approaching them. Its force was so
                     great that several rocks weighing many tons were turned completely over by it.
                     The two men, thinking that their hour had come, fell on their knees, and
                     repeated aloud the confession of their faith. "There is but one God, and
                     Mahomet is his prophet," cried Handermoff as the water covered his feet. "God
                     help us, for all is lost!" cried the Pacha: "we will die together," he added,
                     as he flung his arms around the other's neck. The waters rolled past them and
                     they sank beneath the surface. The love of life which God has implanted in the
                     heart of every human being caused them to release their hold of each other, and
                     they rose to the surface. Both were expert swimmers, but what could they do
                     against the fury of the current. Again they sank, and again did they rise to
                     the surface. Finding that his strength was gone, Handermoff raised his head to
                     take a last look at the sky: a loud shout caused him to turn his face towards
                     the woods. Within twenty yards of him he saw a female on horseback, rapidly
                     making her way towards him. On seeing her face, he uttered a cry of joy, and
                     murmured the name of "Marritta." On hearing that name, Pacha raised his
                     head.
                  "We are saved!" he shouted, as he half sprung out of the water. With frantic
                     haste Marritta urged on her steed, and as she drew near the men, she
                     cried:—
                  "Seize the pommel of the saddle, and keep a tight hold on it."
                  The men obeyed. Each felt that on his hold depended his life.
                  "Are you ready?" cried Marritta as she raised her whip.
                  "Ready!" shouted the two men, and the horse dashed forward. In a few minutes
                     they reached the woods. Five minutes more and they were on the dry land.
                  "Handermoff," cried Marritta, as the young man embraced her, "talk not of love
                     now. Away with it, and put on the courage of a lion. The enemy are around us,
                     and we cannot escape without cutting our way through. Remember the war cry of
                     our nation, and if you fall, fall with your dagger in the heart of your enemy,
                     and let your last words be the name of the Sultan, and the confession of our
                     faith."
                  "But I have no arms," cried Handermoff.
                  "Are our horses in the same place where we left them?" asked Pacha.
                  Without making any answer to the question, Marritta touched her horse with the
                     whip and the animal darted forward. Soon they were lost to view in the thickest
                     of the woods.
                  "Where has she gone?" asked Handermoff, in surprise.
                  "After our horses, no doubt," replied Pacha.
                  
                  He was right. In a few minutes she returned, leading two horses by the bridles.
                     Across the pummel of her saddle was a small silken banner. As she reached the
                     men, she raised the banner high above her head, and with a cry of enthusiasm
                     exclaimed, as she pointed to the Crescent, "Behold the banner of the
                     Ottomans?"
                  "This banner," said Pacha, as he took it from her, "was made by the Sultan's
                     favorite wife. When I received it from her I swore to dye it in the blood of
                     our enemies. Aye! I swore it, and Omer Pacha has never been known to break his
                     oath," and touching the crescent with his finger, he gave back the banner to
                     Marritta.
                  "It was made by a woman's hands; let it be carried in the thickest of the fight
                     by the lover of the Prophet," said he, as he sprang upon his horse. "Come,
                     Handermoff, your horse is waiting for you."
                  The young man gave one last look at the inn, or rather what was left of it, and
                     sprang into the saddle. To his great joy, he discovered a sabre fastened to one
                     of the holsters.
                  "How lucky that we took only our guns with us when we attacked the inn," said
                     Pacha, as he drew a pair of pistols from the holster, and keenly examined the
                     flints.
                  "Yes, it was lucky that you acted upon my advice," said Marritta; "but our poor
                     comrades, where are they now?"
                  "Dead," said Pacha, covering his face with his hand; "they lie beneath the
                     wave; but fear not, I will avenge their death. And now let us forward."
                  For several miles they rode along in silence. They knew that the enemy were
                     around them, and that the slightest noise would betray them. They kept in the
                     shadow of the trees as far as possible. Suddenly, Marritta stopped.
                  "Hush," said she, in a low voice, "and do what I do," and drawing several
                     pieces of cloth from one of the holsters, she tied them around the horse's
                     hoofs. The others imitated her example in silence.
                  "We are in the most dangerous part of the woods," said Marritta, and they again
                     moved forward. "Keep your arms ready," said she, as they emerged into an open
                     place. Hardly had the words been spoken when they heard a loud howl so near
                     them that it caused them to start back in terror.
                  "It is the wolves!" shouted Pacha in a tone of horror, and giving their horses
                     the spur they dashed along the ground with the rapidity of lightning. Suddenly
                     Pacha's horse stumbled and fell.
                  "Mount behind me, quick!" cried Handermoff, as by the bright moonlight he saw a
                     huge wolf springing towards them. In an instant Pacha was in the saddle and
                     again they dashed forward. The horses seemed to know that the lives of their
                      riders depended upon them, and every
                     moment they increased their speed. Soon the howling of the wolves grew fainter
                     and fainter, and when they again entered the woods it had entirely died
                     away.
                  "What a narrow escape," said Pacha, as he wiped the perspiration from his brow
                     with the back of his hand. "Sooner would I face a thousand men than fall into
                     the fangs of a wolf, especially at this season of the year.
                  "Let us stop a few minutes," said Marritta. "Our horses are tired, and it will
                     not do for us to fatigue them too much. We have a long journey before us, and
                     should we lose our horses Heaven only knows whether we would reach our country
                     in safety."
                  "Keep in the shadow of the trees," said Pacha. "Do not dismount, for it will be
                     dangerous for us to leave our horses."
                  "Would that we were safe in our own country," said Marritta.
                  "Hush," said Pacha, "somebody is coming;" and he glided behind a tree. The
                     others imitated his example.
                  "There is no one," said Handermoff, after they had waited a few minutes in
                     anxious silence.
                  "A false alarm," said Pacha, with a smile. "And now let us be moving."
                  They had scarcely proceeded a dozen yards when three men sprang out from behind
                     a tree, and caught their horses by the bridles.
                  "Surrender!" cried one, as he pointed a large, formidable looking pistol at
                     Handermoff. Without a word, and with a movement rapid as lightning, the latter
                     drew his sabre and gave the other a blow across the head that felled him to the
                     ground. He then flew to the aid of Marritta, but before he could reach her, she
                     had drawn a pistol and shot her assailant dead.
                  On seeing the fate of his companions, the other flew towards the woods, which
                     he managed to reach in safety.
                  "Robbers, I presume," said Pacha, as they again started forward. They had not
                     proceeded more than twenty rods before they saw three horses tied to a
                     tree.
                  "These horses appear to be fresh, while ours are weary," said Pacha. "Let us
                     change." And springing to the ground, he untied one of the animals and mounted
                     him. As he did so, he uttered a cry of joy.
                  "Dismount," said he, "these horses are of the Arabian breed, the best animals
                     in the world. They will carry us twice as far in one day as ours will."
                  In five minutes, Marritta and our hero were mounted on the two horses. In one
                     of the saddle-bags they found a supply of food, and several small flasks of
                     wine.
                  "Your health," said Pacha, with a smile, and raising one of the flasks to his
                     lips he poured the contents down his throat.
                  "The best I ever tasted," said he, throwing the bottle upon the ground, "and
                     now, suppose we remain here a few hours and rest ourselves."
                  "Rather let us ride forward a few miles further," said Marritta. "Remember,
                     every step we take brings us nearer our own country."
                  "True," said Pacha, and again they rode forward. Several hours passed and not a
                     word was spoken on either side. At length they reached a small spring. Here
                     they stopped to water their horses.
                  "If nothing happens," said Pacha, as he drew a small map from his pocket, "we
                     shall soon reach the banks of the Dnieper."
                  "Let us stay here a few hours," said Handermoff. "Marritta is tired. See, she
                     can scarcely keep herself from falling."
                  "Let it be so, then," said Pacha, as he tied his horse to a tree. When this was
                     done, he threw himself upon the ground. The others imitated his example, and
                     soon they were all fast asleep.
                  The sun had not risen five minutes ere they were awake. After washing
                     themselves at the spring they drew out the food from the saddle-bag. The long
                     journey had given them a good appetite, and they enjoyed their meal the better
                     for it. As soon as the meal was finished they mounted their horses, and again
                     rode forward.
                  At noon they reached the banks of the Dnieper. Pacha hailed a schooner, and
                     offered the captain a large sum to take them to the Black Sea. The captain
                     consented, and in four days they reached the city of Cherson. Here they were
                     obliged to land and take to the woods, for fear that the vessel would be
                     searched. In three days they reached Odessa. Here they remained for several
                     days.
                  One day as they were seated in the dining room of the inn, the landlord entered
                     and in a hurried voice informed them that a party of the Emperor's soldiers
                     were below, and that they were about to search the house. Pacha slipped a heavy
                     purse into the landlord's hands, and the latter by an underground passage,
                     conducted them to the woods. Here they found their horses tied to a tree. The
                     landlord pointed out the road to Bender, and then left them. In three days they
                     readied the town. As Pacha was acquainted with the landlord of the inn, he felt
                     no apprehensions of treachery. The landlord appeared to be greatly pleased on
                     seeing them and immediately conducted them to a secret room in the roof. When
                     night came they set out for Ismail, and in five days they crossed the Danube.
                     They were now safe in their own country.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  It was a clear, pleasant afternoon, January the 3d, 1854, that on the road
                     leading to the town of Citale, might have been seen a body of troops numbering
                     in all fifteen thousand men. The numerous flags in their midst showed that they
                     were Turks. The army was divided into six divisions, each division numbering
                     two thousand five hundred men. In the center of each division was a huge banner
                     with a half moon stamped on it. The men were well armed, and appeared to be
                     very happy. Some were mounted on horseback, but by far the greater number were
                     on foot. In the center of the third division were fifteen pieces of artillery.
                     At the head of the first division rode the commander-in-chief, Omer Pacha.
                     Close behind him followed several of his officers, who were gaily chatting with
                     each other. They heeded not the presence of their commander, for they knew that
                     he would not interrupt them. While on the road, the men had permission to talk
                     with each other as much as they pleased, and they, of course, took advantage of
                     this permission.
                  Behind the last division followed several hundred wagons. These were loaded
                     with provisions, tents, and everything that was needful for the benefit of the
                     army.
                  "Yonder," said one of the officers, as he pointed with his sword in the
                     direction of the town, "yonder lies Citale. We are advancing towards it with
                     joyful spirits, brave hearts, and a good commander. How will we leave it?"
                  
                  "As conquerers," said another. "Rest assured that although we came off second
                     best at Sinope, it will not be the case with this place."
                  "Think you that our commander will attack the place to-night?" asked
                     another.
                  "No, I do not," was the reply. "Gen. Pacha is too good a general to allow his
                     weary troops to attack a place so strongly fortified as Citale, without giving
                     them a short rest. At any rate, I prefer attacking the place to-night. I feel
                     so ferocious that I could eat a dozen Russians for supper, and about the same
                     number for my breakfast."
                  "Ugh," said one of the officers, with an exclamation of disgust. "Your words
                     are enough to make one sick."
                  All the officers burst into a loud laugh.
                  "The Russians seem to be prepared for us," said another of the officers, as he
                     drew out his spy glass, and raised it to his eye. "We will have to fight hard
                     to get possession of that place."
                  "Perhaps so," said another. "I hope the general will make us a speech before we
                     attack the place. Ten words from him make the Turks fight like devils."
                  "I wonder what has become of Handermoff," said another. "I have not seen him
                     for several days."
                  "Perhaps the general sent him with a message to the Sultan. He appears to be a
                     favorite with him."
                  "And deservedly so," said another, warmly. "Although I have only known the
                     young man a few weeks, I love him as though he were my brother."
                  "Say rather that you love his sister," said another.
                  "His sister!" repeated the other, in a tone of surprise. "Do you mean the
                     female that carries the banner?"
                  "Yes; is she not his sister?"
                  "No."
                  "His wife, perhaps?"
                  "Neither one nor the other."
                  "Ah! see how it is," said the other with a smile. "How strange that I did not
                     see it before."
                  "You are mistaken in your supposition. She is not his mistress."
                  "How queer it is that the Turks entertain the idea that women have no souls,"
                     said the one who had first spoken.
                  "Very strange," said another.
                  "What a pity it is that Omer Pacha is not a Frenchman."
                  "Well, it is a pity," said another. "It was very kind of him to give us a
                     command in his army."
                  "He would not have done so were it not that we understand surveying."
                  "How lucky it is that we all rank alike."
                  "Why so?" exclaimed several.
                  "Why, were one higher in rank than another, we would be quarreling with each
                     other all the time."
                  At this moment the general reined in his horse, and waited for the others to
                     approach.
                  "Gentlemen," said he, "although a general, I am not ashamed to ask your advice.
                     Will it be the best for us to encamp on the right or left hand of the city, or
                     on that rising piece of ground?"
                  "Choose the latter, by all means," said one of the officers. "Although it is
                     within reach of the enemy's balls, we shall be better able to stand our ground
                     in case of an attack.
                  "What do you think of it?" asked Pacha, of another.
                  "Choose the latter—"
                  His speech was suddenly cut short by a musket bullet, and he fell from his
                     horse. One of his comrades sprang from his horse and bent over him.
                  "Armoot," said he, "where are you hurt?"
                  "In the breast. Tell my father that I died facing the enemy." And with a low
                     groan he expired.
                  "He is dead," said the other, as he wiped a tear from his eye.
                  "Such is the fate of war," said the general, in a musing tone. "How many, like
                     him, will be cut off in the flower of their youth. What will his parents
                     think—what agony will they suffer when they hear that their only son is
                     dead—but away with these thoughts. What have I to do with them? What right have
                     they to
                      enter a soldier's bosom?" and putting
                     spurs into his horse, he rode towards the first division.
                  "Pass the word along the line to halt," he said, and in an instant that dark
                     moving mass was as motionless as death. Drawing his sword, the general pointed
                     to the town of Citale and cried—"Behold the town that we are about to attack.
                     The first gun has been fired: the first victim has fallen. Within three days
                     the flag that is now waving on yonder wall shall come down, and the crescent
                     shall take its place. Show no mercy, for should we be defeated we need expect
                     none. But we shall not be defeated. The general who commands you has sworn
                     never to turn his back to the foe. Within three days that place shall be ours,
                     or your general will have ceased to live."
                  In spite of all their efforts to prevent it, a loud cheer burst from the Turks.
                     The general smiled as he saw the effect that his words had upon them.
                  In a few minutes the order was given to break ranks, and before two hours had
                     passed all of the tents had been put up. In company with his officers, the
                     general approached as near to the town as he could without endangering the
                     safety of his officers. After a short consultation it was resolved that the
                     town should be attacked on the eastern side. When the consultation was over,
                     the general and his officers retired to the encampment, where they separated
                     for the night.
                  When the sun disappeared in the west, sentinels were stationed on all sides of
                     the encampment. Numerous were the orders that were given them not to let any
                     one leave the encampment or enter it without the watchword. When this had been
                     done to his satisfaction, the general retired to his tent, but not to sleep.
                     From a small iron chest that stood in one corner of the tent he drew several
                     papers and attentively examined them. One of them was a map of the country, the
                     others were letters from the Sultan. After perusing them attentively, a smile
                     of satisfaction stole over his features. "I was sure of it," he murmured, as he
                     leaned with his elbow upon the table. For above an hour he remained in deep
                     thought; and then rising from the table he threw himself upon the bed.
                  It was about nine o'clock in the evening, when the sentinel who was stationed
                     on the right hand side of the encampment saw, or thought he saw, the outline of
                     a tall figure creeping along the ground. Not wishing to disturb the other
                     sentinels, he silently cocked his gun, and pointed it in the direction of the
                     figure. Hardly had he done this when the figure arose from the ground and
                     approached him.
                  "Stand back," said the sentinel, as he laid his hand on the trigger. "Who are
                     you—give the password."
                  "I do not know it," said the other, as he continued to approach. "I have
                     something of importance to say to you. Something that concerns the safety of
                     your general."
                  "What is it?" asked the sentinel, as he let fall his musket.
                  "Bend your head—no one must hear me," said the other, and as the sentinel did
                     as he desired he drew a knife and plunged it into his body. He then gave the
                     body a kick on one side, and bending his head he listened attentively.
                  "All is silent," he muttered, as he replaced the knife in his belt, and
                     throwing himself upon his knees, he crept slowly forward in the direction of
                     the general's tent.
                  Hardly had he disappeared in the darkness, when a man sprung out from behind a
                     tree, and followed him. Little did the assassin think that he was followed.
                     Silently he crept along the ground, keeping all the while in the shade so as to
                     escape observation. Soon he reached the tent. Here he paused, and laying his
                     ear on the ground he listened attentively. All was still. With a low chuckle of
                     gratification he drew his knife and cutting a slit in the tent large enough to
                     admit himself he passed through. There was but one lamp burning, and that was
                     standing on the table close to the general's bedside. Rapidly yet noiselessly
                     the assassin approached the bed and drew back the curtains. The heavy breathing
                     told him that the general slept. The assassin laid his hand on the lamp and
                     stood for a moment as though undecided. At length slowly raising the lamp he
                     held it before the general's face, and eagerly scanned his features. A savage
                     smile passed over his countenance as he laid the lamp on the table and drew his
                     dagger. Raising the weapon high above his head, he grasped the general by the
                     throat and awoke him. The latter was so surprised at being awakened so suddenly
                     that he made no attempt to resist.
                  "Minion of the Sultan!" cried the assassin, as he again drew back his arm to
                     give the blow. The general closed his eyes and thought his last hour was come.
                     But the blow fell not, and he opened his eyes. To his surprise he saw the
                     assassin struggling with another person on the floor. The light of the lamp was
                     too feeble for him to distinguish his features. Fiercely they rolled over the
                     floor, the assassin trying to regain his knife which he had dropped in the
                     scuffle, and the other striving with all his strength to prevent him; the
                     assassin succeeded however. It was then that the general thought of going to
                     the assistance of his preserver. Before he could reach him, however, the
                     assassin had managed to regain his feet. With a loud cry of baffled rage he
                     sprang upon the general. The latter managed to grasp his wrist, and with a
                     sudden exertion of his superior strength he forced back his arm, and giving it
                     a sudden twist he dislocated it. With a loud cry of agony the assassin fell to
                     the floor. In falling he upset the table on which the lamp had stood, and in an
                     instant the tent was in a blaze. Unheeding it, the general threw himself upon
                     the assassin and strove to prevent him from escaping. The assassin made some
                     fearful attempts to escape, and at length he succeeded. Hardly had he
                     disappeared when several of the soldiers sprang through the flames into the
                     tent.
                  "Pursue him!" cried the general, pointing in the direction which the assassin
                     had taken. "Pursue him! and if you take him bring him to me. What! Handermoff,
                     and was it you that saved my life?—but no words now—pursue him!" and seizing
                     his sword the general rushed from the tent.
                  By this time the whole camp was in motion, and it was a very difficult thing to
                     follow the assassin. Handermoff alone managed to get upon the right track. The
                     assassin took a direction towards the town of Citale. Fiercely did the avenger
                     follow on his track. Several times Handermoff laid his hands on him, but still
                     he managed to elude his grasp. They were now within twenty rods of the town,
                     and Handermoff was almost tempted to give up the chase. The last words of his
                     general, and the desire to avenge the death of the sentinel, made him keep on.
                     Just as the man reached the gate, he sprang upon him, and a short and violent
                     struggle ensued. Finding that he was getting the worst of it, the man uttered
                     an exclamation for help, and at the same time shouted a few words, the meaning
                     of which was known only to the towns-people. In an instant the gate was flung
                     open and a small body of men came forth. Our hero attempted to rise and defend
                     himself, but ere he could do so several men sprang upon him and dragged him
                     through the gate. Hardly had it closed behind them when several of the soldiers
                     from the Turkish camp came up, and in a few minutes the news was borne to the
                     general, that his favorite, Charles Handermoff, was a prisoner.
                  On receiving the news the general sent immediately for Marritta. When informed
                     of the capture of her lover by the enemy she sank down into a chair. The
                     general attempted to console her.
                  "Fear not," said he, "we will have him again ere the rising of to-morrow's
                     sun."
                  "No, no," said Marritta; "when once a Turk of any consequence falls into the
                     hands of the Russians his doom is sealed."
                  "It may be so in some cases," said the general, "but they will not dare to hang
                     Handermoff. They know he is my favorite officer, and——"
                  "So much the worse for him," said Marritta. "Knowing that he is your favorite
                     officer they will hang him the more readily. Poor Charles, I fear that he is
                     already dead," and she covered her face with her hands.
                  "Let them hang him if they dare," cried Pacha, grasping his sabre, "and oh!
                     they will repent it to their latest breath. They will curse the hour that he
                     fell into their hands. My vengeance may be slow, but it will be sure."
                  "Aye! 'tis easy to talk of vengeance now, but while you are standing here they
                     may be leading him to execution. Oh! General Pacha, men call you brave—I know
                     that you are brave. Why not attack the town to-night? Your men are impatient to
                     attack the place. Why not gratify them? The longer we delay in attacking the
                     place, the warmer will be our reception. Remember, Charles saved your life at
                     the risk of his own. In obeying your orders he was taken prisoner. Save him,
                     for you alone can save him."
                  "Marritta, it is 
                        imposible
                        impossible
                      for me to attack the place this night," said the general, his lips
                     quivering with emotion. "My men are tired, and they will meet with a strong
                     resistance. The Russians will fight so long as they can raise an arm, for they
                     know what their fate will be if defeated. To-morrow——"
                  "To-morrow will be too late," said Marritta with a burst of agony; "but as you
                     refuse to save him I must attempt it myself," and springing from her seat she
                     rushed madly from the tent.
                  Let us return to Handermoff. When the gate closed behind him he was dragged through several streets by his
                     captors, who, with exulting shouts opened the door of a large gloomy looking
                     mansion, and bore him up the stairs. The young man made no resistance for he
                     knew that it would be useless. When they reached the top of the stairs, one of
                     the men opened the door of a room and entered closing the door behind him. A
                     profound silence was maintained by his captors. Suddenly the door opened, and
                     the man who had entered before made a sign with his hand, and before our hero
                     had time to speak he was pushed into the room. On raising his head and looking
                     towards the table he saw the well known features of General Gortschakoff.
                  "What," cried the latter in a tone of joy, "Charles Handermoff. This is indeed
                     a prize. Little did I expect, young man, to meet with you again."
                  "Perhaps not," said our hero, quietly; "but you will please to remember that I
                     am a prisoner, and as such by the honor of your nation—if indeed there is any
                     honor in it—you are bound to treat me gently, and to exchange me the first
                     opportunity that offers."
                  "And think you," said Gortschakoff, "that now I have you safe, I will permit
                     you to go again? No, no, young man, you are mistaken. I know your power over
                     your countrymen, and, believe me, it will be a long time before they see you
                     again."
                  "I spoke truly when I said there was no honor in a Russian," said Handermoff
                     with a bitter smile: "but there is one thing that you have forgotten, General
                     Gortschakoff, and that is, there is an army encamped within a mile of this
                     place."
                  "And what can they do?" said Gortschakoff. "Our walls are strong; our men are
                     brave; and they are well armed. If your general takes this place a miracle will
                     have been accomplished."
                  "Let me tell you what we will do," said Handermoff. "We will batter down your
                     walls, slaughter your men by the thousand, seize your arms and burn your
                     houses. In a week, aye, perhaps sooner, this town will have been burnt to
                     ashes."
                  "This is sheer folly," said Gortschakoff. "Perhaps you do not know that an army
                     of eighteen thousand men will leave Kavaul to-morrow and advance to our aid.
                     What say you now?"
                  "Simply that I do not believe you," replied Handermoff, coolly, although in his
                     heart he believed the information to be true.
                  "I will prove it," said Gortschakoff, clapping his hands. The door opened and
                     the men whom our hero had pursued to the gate of the town entered the room.
                  "Did any one leave the town yesterday," asked Gortschakoff.
                  "Yes," was the reply. "Voutor departed yesterday for Kavaul."
                  "When did he return?" asked Gortschakoff.
                  "This morning. He brought us the news that eighteen thousand of our countrymen
                     will leave Kavaul to-morrow to aid us; but I thought that you knew that
                     already."
                  "So I did," said Gortschakoff, pointing to the door. The man immediately left
                     the room. "You see the information is true after all."
                  "It may and it may not be true," said Handermoff; "but suppose that the
                     information were true, one Turk is a match for six Russians."
                  "How so?" asked Gortschakoff, in surprise.
                  "Because we fight in defense of our native land, to hurl back the invaders of
                     our country, and to defend our religion. You fight because you are forced to do
                     so—because you are obliged to obey the orders of your tyrant. Believe me,
                     General Gortschakoff, before the year has passed you will find that men who
                     fight in defense of their country fight far better than those who are forced to
                     fight merely to gratify the will of a capricious tyrant."
                  At this moment the door opened, and a man entered the room. After whispering a
                     few words to the general he retired.
                  "I must bid you good evening," said Gortschakoff, "and I may as well inform you
                     to prepare for death. Hope not for mercy, for none will be shown you," and rang
                     a small bell which lay upon the table. In an instant the part of the floor on
                     which our hero was standing sank down, and he found himself in gloomy
                     darkness.
                  Let us return to Marritta. On leaving the general's tent she instantly
                     proceeded to her own, and throwing up the lid of a huge chest she drew out
                     several uniforms. From among them she picked out one of the kind worn by a
                     Russian soldier. After donning herself in this strange costume, she drew out
                     several small bottles, and proceeded to change the color of her complexion. A
                     false beard and a wig, and the transformation was complete. She then drew out
                     several small pistols, together with a dagger, and placed them in her bosom.
                     She then left the tent and walked rapidly in the direction of Citale. On
                     reaching the outskirts of the encampment, she was challenged by a sentinel. A
                     few words passed between them, and the soldier permitted her to pass on. On
                     nearing the town she paused. She had not as yet made up any plan to enter the
                     town. After considering a few minutes, a thought seemed to strike her, and
                     raising her head she thanked Heaven by a look for the timely thought. She then
                     ran swiftly in the direction of the town, and on reaching it she fell down on
                     her knees beside the gate, as though exhausted.
                  "Help! Open the gate," she cried, as with head bent forward she eagerly
                     listened to hear if any one was stirring.
                  "Who's there?" shouted a voice from the other side of the gate.
                  "Let me in," cried Marritta, making her voice appear as rough as possible, "I
                     have important news for the general."
                  "Let me see how many of you there are," said the man, and mounting the wall he
                     set fire to the rocket which he held in his hand, and looked downward. Seeing
                     there was but one, and that one a Russian, he jumped down and unbarred the
                     gate.
                  "Where is General Gortschakoff?" asked Marritta, as she entered the town.
                  "Come with me," said the man, "I will point out to you the house in which he
                     resides; but first I must get somebody to watch the gate," and saying this, he
                     ran off.
                  "Now that I am in the town," said Marritta, "fortune must guide me. Shall I
                     wait for this man or not? What have I to say to General Gortschakoff? Nothing.
                     It will be better for me to guide myself than be guided by others," and she
                     paused for a moment in deep thought. At length, on raising her head, she saw a
                     man standing near her.
                  "Comrade," said he, "you appear to be sad."
                  "The news I received just now is enough to make me sad," said Marritta.
                  "Perhaps your mother is dead," said the other.
                  "Yes, that is it," said Marritta.
                  "Well, comrade," said the Russian, kindly, "it is no use in brooding over our
                     troubles. Your mother is better off where she is, and perhaps she may be
                     looking down upon you and grieving that you take her loss so much to heart.
                     Come, cheer up, and come with me. There's nothing like a good glass of brandy.
                     It makes us forget our troubles. It makes us think that we are in the second
                     heaven. Come with me, comrade, and I'll soon make you forget your loss."
                  Hardly caring where she went, Marritta followed him. They passed through
                     several streets, and at length the guide stopped in front of a wine house. As
                     he opened the door, the merry sound of laughter, and the jingling of glasses
                     fell upon her ears.
                  "This is the place," said the guide. "When you pass this door you leave care
                     and trouble outside."
                  As Marritta entered, several of the soldiers looked up and stared her rudely in
                     the face.
                  "Hark ye, comrades," said the guide, "this man is under my protection. You all
                     know me, and you all know what I can do. So cease your staring. Dorick, it
                     seems to me by the way you look at my friend that you see something peculiar.
                     What is it?"
                  "Nothing," replied the other; and as soon as Marritta's back was turned, he
                     whispered to two of his men and they left the house.
                  "Bring us a bottle of wine, landlord," said Marritta's new acquaintance; "your
                     best, mind you, and make haste about it."
                  The wine was brought, together with two glasses. The guide poured out a
                     glassfull for himself and another for Marritta.
                  "Here, comrades," said he, as he raised the glass high above his head, "here is
                     to the health of Nicholas, the Emperor of Russia, the man who has never turned
                     his back to his foe, and never will. Drink, comrades, drink to the health of
                     the Czar," and he drained his glass.
                  "Your friend does not drink," said one of the men, pointing to Marritta.
                  "Mind your own business, friend, and leave that of others alone. What is the
                     matter with the wine, don't it suit you?"
                  "No," said Marritta, glad of any excuse to get from drinking the toast.
                  
                  "Well, well, people need not drink unless they like," said the guide. "Perhaps
                     you would like to try a glass of brandy?"
                  Before Marritta, could reply, the door opened, and three men entered the room.
                     One of them walked up to her, and laying his hand on her shoulder, he said,
                     "The General wants you."
                  "What for?" asked Marritta.
                  "I do not know," was the reply. "Come and see.
                  "Now, this is too bad to rob me of a new acquaintance so soon," said the guide.
                     "What does he want of him?"
                  "He is suspected of being a spy," was the reply.
                  "You may as well go," said the guide: "but fear not, no harm shall happen to
                     you, at least if I can help it. I will accompany you as far as the General's
                     house," and, followed by the three men, Marritta and the guide left the
                     house.
                  On reaching the General's house, she was taken into the same room in which
                     Handermoff had been not five minutes before. Little did they think that they
                     were within sound of each other's voice. As Marritta entered the room with the
                     three men, the General waved his hand as a sign, and she was left standing in
                     the 
                        middte
                        middle
                      of the floor.
                  "Who are you, and what is your name?" asked Gortschakoff, as he examined her
                     countenance attentively.
                  "What right have you to question me?" said Marritta, as she folded her arms and
                     gazed him sternly in the face.
                  "The right that every general has to question the soldiers who are under him,"
                     replied Gortschakoff; "but you have not answered my questions."
                  "My name is Ludock. By birth I am a Russian."
                  "When did you enter the town?" asked the general. Marritta hesitated ere she
                     replied, "This evening."
                  "Who permitted you to enter the town?" asked Gortschakoff.
                  "One of your men."
                  "His name?"
                  "I do not know it, because I was not inquisitive enough to ask it."
                  The general clapped his hands and a man entered the room. Marritta recognized
                     in him the soldier who had opened the gate for her.
                  "Is this the person whom you permitted to enter the town this evening?" asked
                     Gortschakoff.
                  "It is," was the reply.
                  "Why did you not bring him here?"
                  "I intended to do so but he escaped."
                  "I was tired of waiting for him," said Marritta, "and as my news is important,
                     the sooner you hear it the better."
                  "What is it?" asked Gortschakoff.
                  "An army of thirty thousand Turks will be here to-morrow, and they will free
                     their countrymen in the storming of this place. You alone can prevent them from
                     coming."
                  "How?" asked the general eagerly.
                  "By destroying the bridge over which they intend to cross. Once destroyed they
                     cannot get over; the current of the river is too strong for them to swim; and
                     there are no boats."
                  "And you advise me to destroy the bridge."
                  "No, I advise you to saw through the timbers, and when the bridge is filled
                     with men it will break down and thousands of the Turks will be destroyed.
                  "A good plan," said the general, "and I will instantly send a party of men to
                     execute it. Go, Starts, and tell Major Vane to prepare his men for marching
                     instantly. Stay, I will write down the orders and then he will not be obliged
                     to come here," and seizing a pen the general wrote rapidly for several minutes.
                     "It is done; take it, Strats, and now off with you. Delay not on the way. Tell
                     Major Vane that honor and promotion are in store for him if he succeeds in
                     sawing away the timbers of the bridge before daylight."
                  "Little did General Gortschakoff think that he was forming a trap to destroy
                     the Russians that were advancing to help him. Little did he think that in order
                     to be near him sooner they would cross that bridge. No, no, he thought not of
                     that. He only thought of defeating the Turkish army that was advancing to the
                     aid of Gen Pacha.
                  
                     
                        HOLTON.JARDINE.NY.
                     
                  
                  
                  "And now," said the general, warmly, "how can I reward you for the information
                     you have brought me?"
                  "By giving me a pass to leave the town any time I wish," replied Marritta.
                  "Take it," said the general, throwing her a small piece of paper. "Is there any
                     thing else I can do for you?"
                  "Yes," replied Marritta. "A young man by the name of Handermoff was taken
                     prisoner to-night. As I have a particular spite against this young man I would
                     feel very thankful were you to make him over to me."
                  "What would you do to him?" asked the general.
                  Marritta drew her fingers across her throat.
                  "You shall have him," said the general as he rang the bell. The door opened and
                     a servant appeared.
                  "Bring hither the prisoner, Charles Handermoff," said Gortschakoff.
                  In a few minutes several men entered leading the prisoner.
                  "Charles Handermoff," said the general, "I told you to prepare for death. It
                     now depends upon that man whether you are to live or die."
                  Handermoff slowly turned his head, and fixed his eye on Marritta. No cry of
                     surprise escaped from him although he recognized her at once. After gazing at
                     her for a moment he turned his eye upon Gortschakoff.
                  "General Gortschakoff can do with me as he pleases," he
                     said.
                  "Take him then," said the general, "and see that he does not
                     escape from you. Had we not better bind his arms?"
                  "No, let him remain as he is," said Marritta. "I am a match for him or any
                     three like him," and taking the prisoner's arm she left the room.
                  In an hour they were safe within the Turkish camp.
                  "Is the general awake?" asked Marritta, of the sentinel that was passing to and
                     fro in front of his tent.
                  "Yes," said the sentinel. "He is under great alarm about you."
                  "I will calm his fears at once," said Marritta, as she entered the tent. The
                     general was seated at a table. As Marritta and her lover entered he raised his
                     head.
                  "What, returned!" cried he in a tone of joy. Little did I expect to see you
                     again, at least so soon.
                  "General Pacha," said Marritta, "a small party of Russians will pass our camp
                     within an hour."
                  "They shall be cut off," said Pacha.
                  "General," said Handermoff, "an army of eighteen thousand men will leave Kavaul
                     to-morrow to aid the inhabitants of Citale."
                  "This is indeed important," said Pacha springing from his seat; "but how and
                     where did you learn this?"
                  "General Gortschakoff himself informed me," replied Handermoff.
                  "Perhaps the information may be false," said Pacha.
                  "No, it is not, of that I am certain."
                  "Then, by heavens! we will attack the town this night," said Pacha, springing
                     from his chair. "Go! sound the alarm drum and tell my men to prepare instantly
                     for the attack. Let the guns be loaded and place them on the left side of the
                     town. Let three of the divisions remain behind and advance to the aid of the
                     others when needed. Set fire to the tents and camp boxes. We will give the
                     Russians a fair chance and show their Emperor that the Turks can defeat his
                     armies even with the advantage on his side. Sound, sound the war cry of the
                     Orlems! We fight for our Sultan, for God and for our country. Away! and prepare
                     the men for the attack."
                  In five minutes the whole camp was in commotion. The tents were fired, and by
                     their light the men prepared themselves for the attack. In obedience to the
                     orders of Pacha the cannons were loaded and placed on the left side of the
                     city. Men were stationed beside them with lighted matches and ordered not to
                     fire until the signal was given. Alarmed by the confusion that prevailed in the
                     Turkish camp the Russians arose and stationed themselves on all sides of the
                     town. The Russian flag was hoisted over he general's house, and several rockets
                     were sent up to warn the Turks that they were prepared to receive them. The
                     Russians knew that if they were defeated no mercy would be shown them, and for
                     that reason they prepare to sell their lives as dearly as possible. As General
                     Gortschakoff passed the different lines, he was greeted with loud cheers. In
                     order to keep up their spirits he acquainted them with the facts that that the
                     bridge had been sawn through, and that an army from Kavaul was advancing to aid
                     them.
                  "I have," said he, in reply to an observation from one of his officers, "I have
                     filled several of the houses with barrels of powder and applied slow matches to
                     them, so that if the Turks should make a breach and enter the town they will
                     find a warmer reception than they expect to meet. I have also barricaded
                     several houses, and should we be driven from the wall we can defend ourselves
                     for several days. I have also placed barrels of provisions in them; and in fact
                     I have done everything that is necessary for the benefit of ourselves.'
                  "There is one thing you have forgotten," said the officer.
                  "And what is that?" asked the general, hurriedly.
                  "The stream, you know, it runs near the Turkish camp and passes through our
                     town. It is the stream that supplies us with water, and were the Turks to cut
                     it off we would die of thirst."
                  "My God! yes," cried Gortschakoff. Give the men who are not employed at the
                     wall orders to fill all the empty barrels and everything that will hold
                     it."
                  The officer sprang from his side, and calling several men to him he ordered
                     them to accompany him to the stream. It was not long ere the cry was raised
                     that the stream had ceased flowing.
                  "We managed to fill about a dozen barrels, and that is all we have to supply at
                     least thirty thousand men, without counting the women and children," said the
                     officer.
                  "Then let them go without it," said Gortschakoff. "Place a guard around the
                     barrels, and give them orders to cut down every one——"
                  His speech was interrupted by a loud report and a sudden jarring of the
                     earth.
                  "They fired too low that time," said the officer. "Next time no doubt they will
                     aim higher, and then if they make a breach in the wall we shall have some warm
                     work."
                  "We must keep them from entering the town as long as possible," said
                     Gortschakoff. "It will be best for us to place a cannon near the point at which
                     they are firing, and when they make a rush through the breach, fire. Load the
                     cannon with nails and stones."
                  "There goes another report," said the officer. "Look out, general, there comes
                     a ball," and the officer sprang into the air. The ball rolled swiftly beneath
                     him and disappeared in a bank of earth.
                  "A narrow escape," said he, laughing.
                  "Very," said the general, also smiling; "but there comes another," and the
                     general sprang to one side. "Look, they have made a breach, follow me," and
                     drawing his sword the general rushed forward.
                  It was true. The Turks had made a breach and were now pouring through it in
                     vast numbers. General Gortscakoff motioned to his men to get out of the way,
                     and hardly had they done so when the cannon was fired. Most of the Turks who
                     had forced their way through the breach were either killed or wounded. Some
                     few, however, were unharmed. These, maddened to fury by the groans of their
                     comrades, sprang upon the Russians and cut them down with their sabres. So
                     desperate was their onset that the Russians were driven back several rods, and
                     it was only at the voice of their general reminding them that no quarter would
                     be shown them if they were defeated, that they returned. Although the number of
                     the Turks was but small, they fought with a bravery unparalleled. But their
                     numbers were too small to insure them the victory. None of them turned to flee.
                     They died fighting bravely, and even when in the agonies of death they tried to
                     use their sabres and bring down an enemy with them. At length, however, the
                     last fell and the Russians gave utterance to a faint cry of victory, that
                     sounded more like a funeral dirge over the dying bodies of their
                     companions.
                  From a slight eminence a mile distant from the town, General Pacha saw the
                     defeat of the party that he had sent to force the breach. In spite of all his
                     efforts to prevent it, a body of nearly one hundred men rushed to the aid of
                     their comrades. As it may be expected, these were driven back to the outside of
                     the wall. Again they rushed forward, and again they were driven back, the
                     number of them decreasing with every attempt. With sorrow and mortification the
                     general saw the few that were left again enter the breach and fall fighting
                     gallantly to the last.
                  "This slaughter must be stopped," said the general, as he gazed around him.
                     "Who, among the officers there, will dare to lead a body to the breach?" he
                     asked, as his eye fell on several officers.
                  "I dare," cried Handermoff, stepping forward.
                  
                  "Go then," said the general. "Take the first division with you; and look you,
                     Charles, much as I love you, I would rather see you meet a soldier's fate than
                     turn your back to the enemy."
                  "If I fall, look for me among the foremost," said Handermoff, waving his sword.
                     "Forward, men! for God, our country, and our Sultan!" and followed by at least
                     two thousand men he rushed forward.
                  With a heart mingling with fear and hope the general saw the men disappear into
                     the breach. In a few minutes they reappeared, for they had been driven back. In
                     vain did the general look for Handermoff. He saw him not. The Russians pursued
                     the retreating party even to the outside of the breach. It was at this moment
                     that a solitary figure, mounted on horseback, and carrying a small silken
                     banner, sprang out from behind the general, and dashed rapidly along in the
                     direction of the breach. With a loud cry of "forward" and "I carry the Sultan's
                     crescent," the figure darted through the breach and disappeared. In an instant
                     the Turks turned on their pursuers, and with headlong fury drove them back to
                     the breach. Here the Russians strove to maintain their ground, but with the
                     fury of a mountain torrent the Turks drove them through the breach. Here the
                     contest was short but bloody. At length, unable to withstand their ground, the
                     Russians retreated to the houses which the general had prepared for them, and
                     with a loud shout of exultation the Turks announced that the breach had been
                     carried.
                  "Forward," cried the general, waving his sword. Unable to restrain their
                     impatience, many of the Turks broke from the ranks and rushed to the breach.
                     These were speedily followed by all the others. The general smiled as he saw
                     their impatience, and made no attempt to restrain them. When he arrived at the
                     breach his first inquiry was for Handermoff. To his surprise he learned that
                     the Russians had taken him prisoner, and that he was in the house over which
                     the Russian flag was waving. Several of the Turks had attempted to force open
                     the door, and they had paid for it with their lives. His next inquiry was for
                     Marritta. To his surprise he learned that the person who had led on the Turks
                     to the attack was no other than Marritta, and that she was safe, having only
                     received a slight wound in the arm. In the presence of all his officers and
                     soldiers he thanked her for her bravery, and vowed that, come what would, he
                     would rescue her lover, and that too within the hour. He then sent a white flag
                     to the house with orders to summon those inside to surrender. The bearer of the
                     flag was shot dead. This act roused the general to madness, and he ordered his
                     men to attack the house. It was in vain, however, that the Turks attempted to
                     force open the door. The Russians fired through the loop-holes which they had
                     made, and killed many. The general ordered his men to bring one of the cannon
                     and place it before the house. This was soon accomplished. The cannon was then
                     loaded and fired. A hole was made large enough for a man to crawl through.
                     Again the cannon was loaded and again fired. This time the door was completely
                     torn from its hinges; and ere the smoke had cleared away many of the Turks were
                     in the house. Bravely they fought their way to the second floor, but here they
                     were forced to stop. In vain did they try to cut their way to the third
                     floor—it was impossible. Rendered furious by their desperate resistance, the
                     Turks set fire to the house. In five minutes a huge volume of smoke enveloped
                     the house. Under cover of this the Turks rushed up the stairs; and the Russians
                     seeing that it was in vain to contend further, threw down their arms and
                     surrendered.
                  "Where is the prisoner whom you took at the breach?" asked the general, of one
                     of the Russians.
                  "In that room," was the reply.
                  The Turks entered the room, and saw a man bound hand and foot lying on the
                     floor. It was Handermoff. Speedily his bonds were cut and once more he was a
                     free man. The fire had now made such headway that the Turks were forced to
                     leave the house, and hardly had they walked a dozen yards when it caved in. The
                     house next to it caught fire; and it was at this moment that one of the
                     Russians informed the general that the house was filled with powder. This
                     startling intelligence caused all to retire many rods from the house. Not many
                     minutes passed before a fearful explosion was heard and the ground rocked to
                     and fro like the waves of the ocean. A thick cloud of smoke covered the house,
                     and when it cleared away nothing was to be seen but smoking ruins.
                  After a desperate struggle of three hours the remaining houses were taken.
                     General Pacha then drew his men together and prepared to give the Russians, who
                     were approaching from Kavaul, a warm reception. A favorable 
                        prosition
                        position
                      was taken near the bridge, and the Turks awaited their approach in
                     anxious silence. It was not long ere the "look-outs" descried a large body of
                     men rapidly approaching. In obedience to the orders of Pacha, the Turks
                     concealed themselves in a thick wood near the bridge. About one half of the
                     Russians had got over the bridge when it fell in. Hundreds were drowned, and
                     those that were on the other side turned and fled. The Turks did not pursue
                     them. Early the next morning they set out on their march to Kavaul.
                  Two months have passed away since the storming of Citale.
                  It was a bright afternoon in March that a large body of men entered the city of
                     Constantinople. In their midst were two persons. Charles Handermoff and
                     Marritta. As they passed through the gate into the city the people who were
                     awaiting their approach gave three loud cheers. In her right hand, Marritta
                     held the banner which two months before she had planted in the breach at
                     Citale.
                  They passed through several streets, the crowd increasing at every step, until
                     they reached the Sultan's palace. Here, in front of the palace, were drawn up
                     in a line all of the soldiers that were in Constantinople. As Handermoff and
                     Marritta passed them they raised their hands to their caps, and gave three loud
                     cheers for the heroine of Citale. Hardly had it ceased, when the window was
                     thrown open and the Sultan came forth on the balcony. In one hand he held a
                     small silken banner, in the other a roll of parchment.
                  "Charles Handermoff," said the Sultan, in a loud clear tone, "by virtue of our
                     office, we hereby appoint you Pashaw of Egypt. Here are the rolls and seals of
                     your office. Marritta, take this banner. It was made by my favorite wife. Take
                     it, and when you again go forth to battle remember the giver. So long as we
                     have such brave souls to defend us we need not fear the world. Take the banner,
                     Marritta, and when next we meet, let it be said that the empire of Russia is no
                     more."
                  "Sultan of Turkey," said Handermoff, "I cannot accept your gift. Let it be
                     given to one more worthy than I. My country needs my aid, and so long as I have
                     power to raise an arm, so long will I fight for her. Nicholas of Russia has
                     sworn to keep up the war until his demands are satisfied, or until death takes
                     him from hence. I too, have sworn an oath—an oath that is registered in heaven.
                     So long as Nicholas of Russia sends his armies to attack us, so long have I
                     sworn to fight against him. Brought up in the Mostar Balkan mountains, God has
                     seen fit to give me the gift of inspiration. Already have I warned Nicholas
                     that he will, if he keeps up the war, perish in a strange land. He despised my
                     warning. Ere many months have passed he will regret that he took not the
                     Prophet's advice. Sultan of Turkey, hear the words of inspiration. Our nation,
                     now on the decline, will grow up to be a great and glorious one. Ere a century
                     has passed people will point to us and say—'This is Turkey, one of the greatest
                     nations on the earth.' Our country will give birth to painters, poets, heroes,
                     authors. But ah! in the future I see something that almost makes me curse my
                     gift of inspiration. Our religion will fade away. The crescent will be taken
                     down and the cross raised in its stead. The Koran will be thrown into the
                     flames, and the religion of Mahomet—where will it be? Gone, forever gone from
                     the face of the earth," and Handermoff covered his face with his hands. At
                     length he raised his head and again spoke:
                  "Sultan of Turkey, be firm, be wise, be prudent. Let your motto be—'Justice to
                     the poor as well as the rich.' Sultan, I have done. Perhaps we shall never meet
                     again. Forget not the Prophet. Marritta, hast thou resolved to go with me or
                     remain behind?"
                  "To go with you," cried the young girl with enthusiasm. "Wherever you go, I go.
                     Together we will fight! Together, if needs be, we will die."
                  "Then come!" said the Prophet, and waving his hand to the Sultan, he turned his
                     horse's head to the army. In five minutes they had left the city far behind
                     them; and in a week they arrived at the army.
                  Reader, think you that the prophecy will be fulfilled? We do.
               
            
            
               
               
                  
               
               THE CIRCASSIAN SLAVE: OR THE HEROINE OF OLTENITZA.
               A TALE OF THE RUSSO-TURKISH WAR
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE year eighteen hundred fifty-three will ever be a memorable one in the
                     history of Europe. In that year, France, England, Turkey and Russia were
                     involved in a war with each other—a war, the end of which is yet to come; and
                     when that end does come it will witness the destruction of one or more of these
                     powers. And which of these powers, reader, will be destroyed? France? No.
                     England? No. Russia? No. Turkey? Yes.
                  Mahomet in the Koran, which, by the way, is but a mere alteration from the
                     christian Bible, says: "My religion will last a thousand years, but no longer."
                     The reader, by glancing at the history of Turkey during the last fifty years,
                     will observe that the religion, of which God is the head and Mahomet is the
                     Prophet, is slowly fading away, and christianity is taking its place. The
                     customs of the Turks, too, are changing. The cushions on which they used to sit
                     cross-legged, have almost entirely disappeared. The turban has been replaced by
                     the European cap. The Janizaries, the most formidable body of troops that
                     Turkey ever produced; who made emperors and destroyed them; who had existed for
                     more than four hundred years; who had remained stationary while all Europe was
                     advancing in civilization; this formidable corps was destroyed by Mahmoud H. in
                     three days, that is, between the 14th and 17th of June, year 1826.
                  It was a warm day in November that the Sultan of Turkey was pacing to and fro
                     in his palace at Constantinople. At a little distance from him, and standing
                     with their arms folded over their breasts, and their eyes cast on the ground,
                     were several black mutes, whose hideous black features afforded a strange
                     contrast to the pale, delicate features of the Sultan. The latter was attired
                     in a black silk coat lined with threads of gold, and trowsers of the same
                     material. In the center of his breast was a crescent covered with jewels. The
                     sabre which hung by his side contained but one jewel; this was a diamond of the
                     largest size. As the Sultan passed and repassed the single ray of light which
                     beamed in from the window this diamond sparkled with a brilliancy that dazzled
                     the eye. But the value of the sabre lay not in the pearl. The Koh-i-noor
                     diamond now worn by the Queen of Great Britain, were it offered in exchange for
                     the blade of that sabre, would not be accepted. And yet, when looking at the
                     blade, we see but little to admire. Examine it closely and you will see small,
                     thin lines of gold. A single stroke of this sword, when wielded by a strong
                     arm, will cut a bar of iron in two, and that, too, without injuring the edge,
                     which is as sharp as a razor. Need we say that the blade of this sabre is of
                     Damascene steel?
                  
                  The Sultan, as we have said before, was pacing to and fro across the room.
                     Several times when his back was turned, the slaves raised their heads and
                     looked inquiringly at each other. What was the cause of their master's
                     impatience? Had some one of his officers displeased him, and was he now
                     thinking of some fearful punishment? They shook their heads at each other; and
                     each one looked at his cimeter to see that it was ready to execute his master's
                     will. After pacing to and fro for several moments, the Sultan raised his
                     head.
                  "Mahoud," said he, to one of the mutes, "has Omer Pasha returned?"
                  The mute made a low salaam as he shook his head in the negative.
                  Again the Sultan resumed his walk, and again he paused. Fixing his eye on the
                     floor, he remained for a few minutes in deep thought. Nothing was heard but the
                     heavy breathing of the mutes. Suddenly the door opened, and a tall, handsome
                     man apparently about fifty years of age, entered the room. He was dressed in
                     the costume of an English general. Without a word he advanced to the Sultan,
                     and folding his arms he stood motionless as a statue.
                  "Ha! Omer Pasha," said the Sultan, as he extended his hand, which the other
                     shook warmly, and then raised it to his lips. "We have been eagerly watching
                     for your arrival, for Allah knows that we have had enough to torment us since
                     you was here last.
                  "My lord," said the other, in a deep musical voice, "in expectation of war
                     between this country and Russia, I have been engaged in repairing our
                     fortifications; increasing the number of men therein; increasing the taxes;
                     exacting contributions and a certain number of men from the mountaineers of the
                     Mostar Balkan range, and which they very willingly gave; and lastly, though not
                     the least, I have had several maps of the country prepared, and which I now
                     offer for your inspection." And saying this, he drew a roll of paper from his
                     bosom and handed them to the Sultan.
                  At this moment a female entered. Her features were concealed by a thick veil.
                     She was attired in the costume of a Circassian slave. On her head she wore a
                     small crown covered with jewels. In a girdle at her breast was a small dagger.
                     Her form was beautifully rounded, and her movements graceful. On seeing Omer
                     Pasha she started back.
                  "Come in, Torinda," said the Sultan. "Omer, this is my favorite wife. Torinda,
                     take the veil from your face. You know I have done away with the absurd custom
                     of my ancestors."
                  The young girl, for she was hardly sixteen, suffered the veil to fall to the
                     floor, and her features were disclosed. They were of surpassing beauty. So
                     surprised was the general at her dazzling beauty that he started back, and an
                     exclamation of wonder burst from his lips. The Sultan heard it with
                     pleasure.
                  "Is she not beautiful?" he said, gazing on her with admiration. "I have many
                     flowers in my harem, but Torinda surpasses them all, not only in beauty but in
                     accomplishments. She can speak several languages—among them the English and
                     French. Ought I not to thank Allah for giving me so beauteous a bride?"
                  Pasha made no reply—he could not speak—he stood like one in a trance.
                  "Torinda," said the Sultan, again smiling, "have you nothing to say to our
                     general?"
                  "Yes," said Torinda, as her eyes wandered over the noble person of Pasha. "I
                     have worked a banner with my own hands. Will Omer accept it from the Sultan's
                     favorite?"
                  "Yes," said the general, suddenly recovering his speech, and speaking with an
                     enthusiasm he could not control, "yes, I will accept of it. The old saying of
                     the Prophet, that 
                        whenvever
                        whenever
                      a banner, made by the favorite wife of the Sultan, is carried in
                     front of an army, that army will be victorious, shall be verified in this case;
                     for what Turk is there that would turn his back on Torinda's banner?"
                  "Mahoud," said the Sultan—the mute sprang forward—"bring hither the
                     banner."
                  The slave bowed and left the room.
                  "Is thy slave permitted, to speak?" asked Torinda, with a smile, as though
                     knowing that it was useless to ask the question.
                  "Speak," said the Sultan. "Thou art not my slave. Thou art my wife."
                  "Omer," said Torinda, "the Sultan has informed me that you are to command his
                     armies in the war against the Russians. Will you write to me often and let me
                     know how the war progresses: and also, whether the Turks fight as bravely as
                     they did in the days of Saladin the Great?"
                  "I will," said Pasha;" but fear not that the courage of the Turks has deserted
                     them. No, no; although they have had years of peace the shadow of what they
                     once were still hovers over them."
                  "Oh!" said Torinda, with a burst of enthusiasm, "would that I were a man, that
                     I might lead on the armies of the Sultan against the invaders of our
                     country."
                  The Sultan smiled. "Torinda," said he, "we have enough of brave hearts to
                     defend us. Retire to the harem. I will join you there shortly. Allah knows that
                     when the women talk of enlisting in the army that the men cannot fail."
                  "One kiss, my lord," said Torinda; and as the Sultan gave it she turned to
                     Pasha. "Remember your promise," she said, and then left the room.
                  "By heavens!" said Pasha, as the door closed behind her, "but she is worthy of
                     being your favorite wife. Many a man would sell his soul to the evil one for
                     one glance of those bright eyes."
                  The door opened and Mahoud appeared. In his hand he bore a small silken banner
                     with a crescent and the name of Omer Pasha worked in it. Around the edges were
                     the words—"There is but one God, and Mahomet is his prophet."
                  "Hand me the banner, Mahoud," said Pasha, as the mute was about to lay it at
                     his feet. Taking it in his hand, he said, as he raised it high above his head,
                     "When next you see this, my lord, it will have been dyed in the blood of our
                     enemies."
                  At this moment a loud shout caused them both to walk to the window. On looking
                     out they saw that the street was crowded with men, and that they bore arms in
                     their hands. For a moment the Sultan trembled with fear, for he thought that an
                     insurrection had taken place, and that the people were about to storm the
                     palace.
                  "Look!" cried Pasha, as a smile of joy came over his features, "look, my lord,
                     these men have come from their distant hills to offer you their aid in hurling
                     back the invaders of our country. They are brave, and from their youth have
                     been trained to arms. Were you to exact anything from them they would turn upon
                     you and the consequences would be fearful. But without asking, they have left
                     their homes, their wives and children, to join our forces. My lord, these men
                     will do more than a dozen legions of our regular troops. Need I tell you that
                     they are Circassians?"
                  "No," said the Sultan, "I recognized them at once. Who could mistake their
                     dress, their arms, and the daring that is stamped upon their features for any
                     other than that daring race? We are proud to think that they are under our
                     sway. Well may Nicholas of Russia tremble when he knows that they are to fight
                     against him. But invite their chiefs to enter our palace, for we would converse
                     with them."
                  The general left the room, but in a few minutes he returned followed by several
                     men. Their half savage, half picturesque dress—their tall and brawny
                     figures—the huge rifles they bore in their hands—the terrible battle-axes that
                     hung in their belts—all these showed that they were fit spirits to command the
                     wild and almost uncontrollable men who acknowledged them for their leaders.
                  "The Sultan, Abd-ul-Mejid," said Pasha. "These, your Majesty, are the chiefs of
                     the Circassians."
                  While the general was speaking, the chiefs gazed around the room in wonder;
                     they had never seen so much magnificence before. When the general pronounced
                     the name of their tribe they turned and fixed their gaze on the Sultan.
                  "So this is our ruler," said one of the chiefs in a hoarse voice. "Why there is
                     not a man in our tribe but what has more strength than he seems to have."
                  "Is there nothing that you can do to give them some idea of your strength?"
                     said Pasha, in a low voice.
                  "Yes," said the Sultan. "Mesrour"—and he clapped his hands. The door flew open
                     and the slave entered.
                  "Bring me a bar of iron," said the Sultan, in a low tone. The slave bowed and
                     left the room. Not five minutes elapsed ere he returned bearing in his hand a
                     small bar of iron weighing, probably, six pounds.
                  "Lay it on the floor," said the Sultan. When this was done, he turned to the
                     chiefs, who were watching him with surprise. "Who among you," he said, "can
                     break that bar with his axe?"
                  "I," exclaimed the chief who had spoken; and handing his gun to one of the
                     others, he drew his battle-axe. Raising the weapon high above his head he
                     brought it down to the floor with such force that the palace shook violently.
                     Still, however, the bar remained uncut.
                  "Look," said the Sultan, and drawing his sword, he waved it several times
                        around his head, and then bringing
                     it with terrible force across the iron bar he cut it in two. As he did so, the
                     chiefs uttered exclamations of astonishment.
                  "What think you of that?" asked the Sultan, as he wiped the sweat from his
                     brow.
                  "The arm of our ruler is of steel," said the chief. "My battle-axe must be
                     sharpened again—your sword needs a new blade."
                  "No," said the Sultan, as he held up the edge; "It is uninjured. Examine it for
                     yourselves," and he gave it to the chief.
                  "Worthy art thou to rule us," said the chief. "Comrades, let us do that which
                     we have never done before. Let us take the oath of allegiance to our
                     sovereign," and he fell upon his knees. The others imitated his example. On
                     seeing this, the Pasha could hardly restrain himself from uttering a cry of
                     joy.
                  The Sultan gave them the oath, and when they had repeated it after him, they
                     arose. Mesrour was again summoned and ordered to bring fifty purses of gold
                     from the treasury. When he returned, the Sultan divided the bags among the
                     chiefs.
                  "Call to-morrow," said the Sultan, as the chiefs turned to depart. "I will see
                     that suitable horses are provided for you. Have you tents to sleep in?"
                  "Tents!" said one, smiling, and pointing to the window, he replied—"See you the
                     blue sky above us? See you the grass that grows in your garden? The one is our
                     tent; the other our bed. When we go forth to battle against our enemies, we
                     take nothing with us but our food and our arms. To you the ground may be damp,
                     the night air cold; but to us who are used to it, it is nothing."
                  "Glad am I that these men have joined us," said Pasha; "but more glad am I to
                     think that they have taken the oath of allegiance to you. Rude and untamed as
                     these warriors are, they never break their word to friend or foe. They have
                     never been defeated, nor never will be so long as they remain in their wild
                     state."
                  "But how came they to join us at all?" asked the Sultan.
                  "Aye, that is the mystery," replied the general. "Some one must have induced
                     them to come here, but who that some one was I know not."
                  "I will ask them to-morrow," said the Sultan; and then clapping his hands, he
                     said, as Mesrour entered the room, "I shall visit my harem now. Tell Torinda
                     that I await her pleasure, Mesrour."
                  Mesrour left the room, and after a short consultation with the general, the
                     Sultan left also. As he disappeared through the door, the Pasha threw himself
                     into a chair and drew a small map from his pocket and attentively examined
                     it.
                  "Should the Russians cross the Danube at this point," he said, "I will conceal
                     the mountaineers behind the trees, and let the remainder show themselves. The
                     Russians will think that our army is small and that it will be an easy matter
                     to defeat us. No doubt they will advance without order. I will then order my
                     men to advance towards them, and while we are attacking them in the front the
                     mountaineers will spring out from behind the trees and attack them. The
                     Russians will be frightened at the great odds against them and they will either
                     throw down their arms and submit, or else retreat across the Danube. In either
                     case the slaughter will be immense. Every Russian destroyed is an enemy less,
                     and I must turn a deaf ear to their cries for mercy. God help them if they fall
                     alive into my hands."
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  
                     
                        
                           Fields, which surround yon rustic cot,
                           While yet I linger here,
                           Adieu! you are not now forgot,
                           To retrospection dear.
                           Streamlet! along whose rippling surge,
                           My youthful limbs were wont to urge
                           At noonday heat their pliant course;
                           Plunging with ardor from the shore,
                           Thy springs will lave these limbs no more,
                           Deprived of active force.
                        
                     
                  
                  THE HAREM—THE SULTAN AND HIS FAVORITE—THE HISTORY; AND THE OATH
                     OF VENGEANCE.
                  The favorite's room in the palace was magnificently furnished. The rarest
                     flowers of the universe were scattered on all sides. Statues from the best
                     sculptors of Italy—paintings rare and valuable were there. Books bound in
                     splendid covers were lying upon the table. On all sides of the room were
                     magnificent mirrors which made the room appear larger than it really was. The
                     floor was covered with a very beautiful and thick carpet. The furniture was of
                     the most gorgeous description. From the ceiling in the center of the room there
                     hung a large chandelier shaped like a tree; in the branches were placed many
                     wax candles of different colors. Harps, guitars, music books, etc., were lying
                     about the room. No room in the palace was so magnificently furnished as this,
                     and well did it deserve the name of the "favorite's room."
                  It was the hour of noon. Standing near one of the magnificent mirrors, and
                     busily engaged in combing her hair, was Torinda. At a little distance from her
                     were two female slaves, both very beautiful; but the beauty of Torinda far
                     outshone theirs. They seemed like two planets by the side of the sun.
                  "Khatoun," said Torinda, as she placed the small jeweled crown on her head,
                     "inform my lord that I am prepared to receive him."
                  The girl left the room. In a few minutes she returned followed by the
                     Sultan.
                  "Come, Torinda," said the Sultan, as he seated himself on the sofa, "come and
                     take your place beside me. Well do I love to retire from the throne and seat
                     myself in this old, accustomed place. When you are near me, I forget the cares
                     of the country, and think only of love. Leave the room, slaves, I would talk to
                     your mistress alone."
                  "And of what shall we talk?" asked Torinda. "Shall it be of war?" and her eyes
                     flashed with an unusual brilliancy; "or shall it be of love?" and as she gave
                     utterance to the word her voice became softer, and her eyes beamed with a
                     strange melting light.
                  "Let it be of love," said the Sultan, drawing his hand across his brow. "War!
                     the name has rung in my ears for many months. Let us speak of anything but
                     that."
                  "Shall I sing of the daring deeds of Solomon the great?" asked Torinda, laying
                     her hand upon the guitar.
                  "Peace, peace," said the Sultan, with a smile. "Fain would I know something of
                     your past history, Torinda. From the few hints that you have dropped out
                     respecting your early life, you have awakened my curiosity."
                  "Listen, my lord," said Torinda, and she thus began:
                  "My history is a strange and eventful one. Born in the Caucasian Mountains, of
                     rich and powerful parents, the fame of my beauty spread throughout your
                     dominions, and many attempts were made to take me from my parents. Owing to my
                     father's vigilance, these attempts were defeated. His influence over the chiefs
                     of the country was very great. He was chosen arbiter in all their disputes; and
                     in return for this the chiefs assisted him to 'put out of the way' all that
                     dared to call themselves his enemies.
                  "My education was well attended to, for my father knew that 'knowledge is
                     power.' He was a very learned man, and could speak several languages with
                        ease.
                      The works of the most renowned authors were as well known to him as
                     to the authors themselves. His memory was very retentive. He never forgot a
                     friend nor forgave an enemy. I being his only child, was of course looked upon
                     as his successor; and as his people were almost always at war, I was brought up
                     to the use of arms. In my sixth year I could bring down the eagle from the
                     crag—the wolf from his den. None could outstrip me in speed—and in the use of
                     the sword none could equal me. Worthy was I to bear the name of Albia.
                  "My mother was not only as beautiful as her daughter, but as well informed. She
                     too was expert in the use of arms; and her influence over the people was nearly
                     as great as my father's. Once, as he lay wounded in the castle a band of armed
                     men made a descent upon it and took us prisoners. My mother was absent at the
                     time. When she returned to the castle and heard that her lord and only child
                     had been carried off by the enemy, she gave the call to arms, and sent the
                     firebrand of war among the friendly chiefs. The chiefs aroused themselves at
                     her call, and soon my native hills resounded with the cry of war. From afar the
                     enemy beheld the preparations to attack them, and their limbs shook with
                     terror. Like the mighty whirlwind my mother fell upon them, and like the
                     falling of the leaves in autumn the enemy fell. Then resounded the cry of
                     victory—then came the firing of the tents. We returned to the castle, and my
                     mother smiled when she saw us in safety. My father smiled when he thought that
                     it was her arm that had rescued him from captivity, and saved his only child
                     from being a slave. Years passed on and I reached my twelfth year.
                  "One day," and here Torinda's voice grew sad and sorrowful, "a chief of some
                     distinction arrived at the castle. He brought with him his warriors, and they
                     were many. He saw me and his heart became enamored of me. He swore that I
                     should be his. We suspected no treachery. Late at night the castle was fired,
                     and ere my parents could defend themselves they were slain. The chief entered
                     my chamber and tore me from my bed. I saw his purpose, and drawing a dagger
                     from beneath my pillow, I raised my arm for the purpose of self-destruction.
                     The chief grasped my arm and wrested the dagger from me. He then bore me to the
                     outside of the castle, which had just been fired, and ordered me to mount the
                     horse which one of his men held. Knowing that it was in vain to resist, I
                     obeyed. Many were the miles we traveled that night. At length we reached the
                     river. Here we paused for the purpose of resting ourselves. While here my heart
                     beat with hope—every moment I expected the arrival of my parents with a
                     party—for I little suspected that they were no more. Time passed on, and they
                     came not. Oh! how I wept that night. Allah knows that that night
                     was the most bitter I ever passed. Daylight came and again we set off. Many,
                     many hours we traveled—the burning sun shone down upon us, my throat was
                     parched with thirst, my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth, and I was so
                     fatigued that I could scarcely keep myself in the saddle. Yet I heeded not
                     these, my whole thoughts were engrossed with my parents. Where were they? Had
                     they failed to discover the road we had taken? No. What then? Little did I
                     imagine that they were dead—that their bodies were consuming in the castle. Oh!
                     Allah! look down upon me and help me to collect the thoughts which burn in my
                     bosom like the simoom of the desert.
                  "Three days passed when we reached the Black Sea. A ship was speedily engaged,
                     and soon we were sailing over the dark waters. One night the chief entered the
                     cabin and made insulting overtures to me. I replied with scorn. He grasped my
                     arm and swore that I should be his. I resisted, and we struggled together. The
                     events of the past week had so wrought upon my mind that I had lost a portion
                     of my strength. Still, however, I managed to tear myself from him, and rushing
                     to the cabin window I threw it open and swore by Allah that if he approached me
                     but one step I would throw myself into the sea. The coward knew my
                     determination; and he left the cabin.
                  "Days passed on; weary days they were, for who could calm the tumult that raged
                     like a stormy sea in the heart? Soon we approached the shore of Turkey. Glad
                     were my feelings then, for I hoped soon to be separated from my persecutor.
                  "One night as I lay upon my couch, the chief entered the cabin and locked the
                     door. I knew his purpose and I sprang to the window; it was locked. On seeing
                     this I folded my arms and gazed the chief sternly in the face. There was
                     something in my eye—perhaps it was the cold, determined look of despair, that
                     made him quail beneath my glance. Knowing, however, that I was a poor
                     defenseless woman, without arms, with nothing to aid me, he bestowed on me a
                     grim smile, and again repeated his
                     overtures. I made no reply, indeed I could not have done so had I wished. The
                     ruffian then grasped me by the arm and drew me towards the bed. Despair lent me
                     strength. I threw him from me; and seizing a large, heavy lamp that stood near,
                     I grasped it in my hands and stood on the defensive. The chief gave utterance
                     to an oath; and no doubt thinking that the death of my parents would terrify
                     me, he briefly told me of their end. It was enough; in a moment despair and
                     fear had vanished, and the demon of Vengeance had taken possession of my heart.
                     With a calm smile—terrible from its very calmness—I walked to the door and
                     leaned with my back against it. I then swore by Allah that I would wreak my
                     vengeance on him; and that too, within the hour. The ruffian grew frightened;
                     before, he had been the aggressor and I the coward; affairs were now changed.
                     Oh! well did the ruffian know from the strange light that beamed from my eye
                     that both of us would never leave that cabin alive; that one of us—perhaps
                     both—would ere an hour passed be lying on the floor—dead. One would remain;
                     but, who could that one be?
                  "'Leave the door,' said he, drawing a pistol from his belt and aiming it at my
                     head. I smiled as he did so, for at that moment I would have welcomed death
                     instead of fearing it.
                  "'Fire!' cried I, 'if you will and rid the world of your greatest enemy.'
                  "'And throw away a fortune also!' said he, with a bitter sneer. 'No, no,
                     Torinda, I have been offered an enormous sum for you, and I have had two much
                     difficulty in earning it, to resign it so quietly.'
                  "'Cursed villain!' said I, 'either you or I do not leave
                     this cabin alive.'
                  "'Leave the door,' said he, 'or by Allah! I swear that I will send a bullet
                     through your body!
                  "'Fire!' cried I, and he pulled the trigger. The bullet whistled past my head
                     and lodged in the door. It was enough. Before he could draw another, I sprang
                     upon him, and throwing him to the floor I drew his knife from his belt. He saw
                     the act and strove to rise to his feet; but I held him down, for I had the
                     strength of twenty men then. In imagination I saw my parents falling beneath
                     the bullets, the castle on fire, the bodies consuming in the flames. Oh! with
                     what a fearful joy I saw his fruitless efforts to rise; with what joy did I
                     hear his cries for mercy and help. I could not strike then, for it seemed to me
                     that the spirit of my mother stood beside me and restrained my arm. Oh! how I
                     gloated over his agony. God! that hour was the sweetest I ever tasted for it
                     was the hour of vengeance—the hour of retribution! The ruffian had taken me
                     from my native mountains—from the stream wherein I had bathed my infant feet!
                     he had destroyed the fondest of fathers—the kindest of mothers! and I, I who
                     had suffered all this, had him in my grasp—groveling at my feet—crying for
                     help—for mercy—mercy! Had he shown any to my parents? No! Aye! I had him thus:
                     a single blow and I could have sent him to the place where he belonged—to Hell!
                     But I would not let him die then. No! I would gloat over his agony—his cries
                     for help were music to my ear! laughed at his sufferings, and at his
                     ineffectual efforts to rise. Had the wealth of the world—the crown of
                     Turkey—been offered to me to leave him then, I would have refused it. Had one
                     of those bright angels, of whom we read in the Koran, appeared before me then
                     and offered me Heaven if I would spare him, and Hell—eternal misery—if I
                     refused, I would have accepted the latter with joy. Aye! 'many have felt the
                     power of woman's love, but few have felt her hate.'
                  "Cut this story short, Torinda," said the Sultan, as he crossed his face with
                     his hands.
                  "I will, my lord," said Torinda, and after pausing a moment, she
                     continued:—"When the villain's voice became so exhausted that he could scarcely
                     speak, then it was that I gave the blow; but, my hand trembled so, that the
                     blow was but a slight one, and instead of entering his heart as I had intended
                     it should, it merely gave him a slight wound. Again he rallied his exhausted
                     strength and again he attempted to rise. I laughed wildly, for I felt that my
                     sense were leaving me, and that what I had to do must be done quick or not at
                     all. Again I raised the knife; again came the faint cry for mercy; again the
                     blow fell; but, this time it entered his heart. I saw the glared eyeballs
                     rolling in their sockets. I saw the half spring into the air, and then the hand
                     clutching at vacancy. I saw him fall back into the arms of death; and then with
                     a loud cry of gratified vengeance, I fell back insensible.
                  "When I awoke I found myself in darkness. That I was still on board the vessel
                     was evident from the rolling of the waves. I stretched out my hand and touched
                     the cold face of the corpse. Any one else, perhaps would have shuddered at the
                     contact; I only smiled. As I rose to my feet, a huge wave struck the vessel,
                     and I fell on the corpse; my cheek against his cheek, my lips touching his.
                     Again I smiled and rose. This time I succeeded, and I stepped lightly towards
                     the door of the cabin. I reached it and turned the handle: I could not open it.
                     Then the thought struck me that the key to the door was in the Chief's pocket.
                     I stepped lightly over the floor, and kneeling down beside the corpse, I felt
                     in the pocket until I had found the key. In a few minutes the door was open,
                     and I ascended to the deck. Then the thought struck me that on learning the
                     chief's death, the men would either murder me or give me up to a more horrid
                     fate. I descended to the cabin, and drawing out the pistols from the belt of
                     the corpse I again ascended to the deck. The night was dark and stormy; no
                     stars shone in the dark, lowering sky. Nothing could be seen but darkness—utter
                     darkness. I heard the rolling of the huge waves as they broke about the sides
                     of the vessel. I approached the bow of the vessel and looked over. My eyes soon
                     became accustomed to the darkness; and, soon I could see the white waves first
                     dashing furiously together as though warring with each other, and then sinking
                     far down, farther than my eyes could reach. Sometimes too, the vessel would be
                     carried far up towards the sky; and then suddenly darting downwards as though
                     about to be swallowed up by the angry waters. I grew wild with the excitement,
                     and laughed at the furious efforts of the waves to sink us. Had any one passed
                     at that moment, he would have taken me for the genius of the storm, and that I
                     could make it cease at my pleasure. But no one passed; the sailors were too
                     much occupied with taking care of the vessel, to see or heed me; and my wild
                     cries were drowned in the roaring of the wind and the dashing of the waves. Oh!
                     it was a fearful night and well suited to the strong passions that raged in my
                     breast.
                  "Daylight at length appeared, and I descended to the cabin. The storm had
                     increased in fury and the vessel was far out of sight of land. The first thing
                     that met my view was the corpse; the eyes were wide open and staring at me with
                     a fearful expression. I threw myself into a chair, and drawing out the pistols,
                     I removed the charges, and taking down the powder horn and bullet flask, I
                     reloaded them. Hardly had I done this when I heard the steps of several men
                     descending the stairs. Hastily concealing the pistols, I awaited their approach
                     with calmness and even with impatience. No thought of danger flashed over my
                     mind, for I feared not death, and had I not the means of defending myself? The
                     door opened and the captain of the vessel attended by three or four of his
                     crew, entered the cabin. They did not see the corpse for it had rolled in one
                     corner of the room.
                  "'Where is your master?' asked the captain.
                  "'My master!' I cried. 'Talk you of a master to a Circassian?'
                  "'The chief, then. Where is he?'
                  "'There!' I replied pointing to the corpse.
                  "'Well,' said the captain, without evincing any great surprise, 'I told you how
                     it would be after all. Glad am I that she has saved us the trouble of putting
                     him out of the way. Throw the body to the sharks, men; and then clean up the
                     stains upon the floor. 'Tis a pity that she didn't do the deed on deck!
                  "'The deed is done and can't be helped,' said one of the sailors; and then
                     taking hold of the body he, with the aid of another, hove it to the deck and
                     flung it into the sea. The captain and the other sailors were about to ascend
                     to the deck when I spoke:
                  "'What do you intend to do with me?' I asked.
                  "'What did the others intend to do with you?' asked the captain.
                  "'Sell me as a slave,' I replied, my lips writhing with scorn.
                  "'And that is what we intend to do with you,' said the captain.
                  "'Hark ye!' said I, 'alone and unarmed I attacked the chief. This act shows
                     you, if you knew it not before, that I am brave—that I fear nothing. Suppose I
                     were to say that I will not be sold as a slave: what would you do then?'
                  "'We would use force,' replied the captain: 'and if you resisted we would throw
                     you to the sharks.'
                  "'And lose the fortune which the chief strove so much for,' said I. But I will
                     not resist on one condition.'
                  "'And that is——'
                  
                  "'That you sell me to the Sultan.'
                  "And who else, think you, would pay the price we ask?' said the captain. 'I am
                     glad to see that we are on so good terms already.'
                  "'I am glad to hear it for your own sake,' said the captain: 'but I can't stand
                     here talking all day. I must attend to the vessel,' and saying this he left
                     me.
                  "At noon I was awakened from a short sleep by hearing strange noises on deck.
                     There was a heavy tramping, followed by a loud yell, and the reports of several
                     pistols. Then there came a loud shout of 'Go to your duty and I will see that
                     the money is divided equally between you.' Hardly was this spoken when the
                     clashing of cutlasses was heard: a pistol shot, and a heavy fall on the deck.
                     Then the confusion ceased. I resolved to ascend to the deck and ascertain what
                     happened. Seeing my pistols were ready for use I ascended the stairs. On
                     reaching the deck the first thing that attracted my attention was the body of a
                     man, his face dreadfully cut and his hair matted with blood. So surprised was I
                     at this strange spectacle that I started back. At this moment the captain
                     approached me. One of his arms was in a sling; in the other he held a cutlass,
                     the blade of which was covered with blood.
                  "'What has happened?' I asked.
                  "'Why some of the crew have been quarreling about the money which we expect to
                     receive for you, and they have carried the quarrel so far as to slay each
                     other. The fools! they ought to have known better.'
                  "Good heavens? was my whole life to be passed in scenes of blood? Such was my
                     first thought; it soon passed away, and the same 
                        savgae
                        savage
                      joy that had filled my mind the night before. The storm, as I said
                     before, had increased in fury. Again I took my station on the bow of the
                     schooner and again I shouted in wild glee. Suddenly the mist cleared away for a
                     moment and I saw that the force of the wind and waves was driving the vessel on
                     shore. Still, by informing the captain of the fact he could save his ship. But
                     I would not, and when the mist cleared away the second time I saw that we were
                     within fifty feet of land. It was at that moment that the crew perceived the
                     danger; they uttered a loud cry of agony, and hardly had it died away when the
                     vessel struck: the waves dashed over her and several of the crew were carried
                     off. Again she struck, another wail of agony flew upon the breeze to Heaven, to
                     tell God that in a moment twenty souls would appear before him. The wail had
                     not died away when I saw a tremendous wave approaching the vessel. The loud cry
                     was cut short as the wave broke over us and in an instant the vessel was lying
                     at the bottom of the sea; the crew were drowned, and I—I was on the top of a
                     large wave which was rapidly bearing me towards the shore. As it neared the
                     shore it increased in strength and in a moment I was thrown far up the sandy
                     beach.
                  "My first thought was to fall upon my knees and give thanks to Allah: my
                     second, to rescue some of my cowards from a watery grave. In vain, however, I
                     looked around, I could see nothing of them: and then I knew that I was the only
                     one saved.
                  
                  "After much toil I succeeded in reaching the top of a high hill. One glance
                     showed me that I was in Turkey. A few miles distant was a large city. I
                     recognized it at once, for I had seen, while in my father's house, many
                     pictures of the diadem of the East. Yes, I knew at once that it was
                     Constantinople.
                  "After a fatiguing walk I entered the city. I gazed about in wonder at the
                     magnificence of the houses and wondered whether Heaven was equal in
                     magnificence to this. Soon I began to grow hungry. Then the thought struck me
                     that I had not so much as a single sequin about me. I once the possessor of
                     millions was now penniless. Where was I to get my food? Beg! What, I the
                     daughter of Albia, beg! Sooner would I plunge the dagger into my heart than
                     stretch forth my hand and beg a sequin.
                  "At length, however, my hunger became so great that I was forced to sink down
                     on a stoop: soon I fell asleep. When I awoke I saw a large crowd standing
                     around me. Some gazed at me with admiration, others with pity, and others with
                     that look which every one, more especially a young and beautiful female, can
                     tell the meaning of in a moment.
                  "Among the lookers on was an old man with a snow white beard. His features were
                     very fine and his face expressed benevolence. I was greatly struck with his
                     appearance. But, oh! little did I know that appearances deceive. Behind him
                     were two slaves who watched his every motion as a tiger watches the enemy who
                     is about to carry off its young.
                  "'Girl,' said the old man, 'why set you here?'
                  "In a very few words I told him my history.
                  "'Come, with me,' said he. "Tis a pity that so fair a face as thine should be
                     exposed to the heat of the sun and the gaze of the multitude. Come with
                     me.'
                  "I obeyed. He led me through several streets; the crowd still following us.
                     Soon we reached a large gloomy looking mansion. The old man gave several taps
                     on the door and we entered. To my surprise I saw about twenty young ladies
                     about the same age as myself lying on the floor. Most of them were very
                     beautiful. I knew from their features that they were my countrywomen—that they
                     were Circassians. Some of them were weeping.
                  'Old man, said I,' starting back, 'who are you, and what is this place?'
                  "'I am a slave dealer, and here are my slaves.'
                  "'It was of no use I could not escape from slavery.
                  "'Set down, Torinda,' said the old man: 'you are the fairest of the lot. You
                     are worthy of being a Sultan's bride.'
                  "'I will be no other,' said I, 'unless it be the bride of death.'
                  "Days passed on, the most beautiful dresses were purchased, and I reigned queen
                     of the slaves. None dare oppose me, for often had they heard of my doings in
                     their own country. The old man made no insulting offers to me. He knew the
                     value of his prize and he determined to keep it perfect.
                  "One day the Sultan's vizier came to the house. He saw me and was struck
                     speechless with astonishment at my extraordinary beauty. Do not accuse me of
                     egotism, my lord, for you know that I am beautiful. He asked my price, it was
                     enormous. I was afraid that he would refuse it, and in obedience to the orders
                     of the old man, I sang my sweetest songs—I spoke in several languages—I
                     performed feats with the pistol, the bow, the spear, the knife and the sabre. I
                     showed him how to handle the rifle, and how to strike off the head of a slave
                     at a single blow. I danced, I played on the harp and other musical instruments
                     which the old man had purchased for me. Aye! the daughter of Albia was well
                     worthy the name of her race. The vizier was astonished, and paid my price
                     without a murmur. The rich dresses were taken from me and I was attired in
                     others of less value: but I cared not for this for I knew that I was going to
                     the palace. Soon we reached the palace and my present master saw me. He was
                     enraptured with my charms—and—and—I am now seated by his side."
                  "Sweet Torinda," said the Sultan, straining her to his bosom, "your story has
                     charmed me: it has made me love you more than ever."
                  "My lord," said Torinda, as she gazed with her beautiful eyes upon the Sultan,
                     "your slave is unhappy."
                  "Unhappy," cried the Sultan. "What has made you so? Has any of my slaves
                     injured you? Has my grand vizier insulted you? Do you doubt my love? Speak,
                     Torinda, and let me know what is the cause!"
                  "My lord," said the slave, her eyes glistening as she spoke, "I wish to fight
                     the battles of my country."
                  "What, you!" cried the Sultan. "No, no, Torinda, we cannot, we shall not part.
                     The pride of the harem must not leave the palace, for if she did her lord and
                     master would die!"
                  "No, no, not that!" cried Torinda, grasping his hand. "Much as I love a
                     soldier's life—much as I wish to fight the battles of my country! I would
                     sooner die than that you suffer any pain on my account.
                  "Dear girl," said the Sultan, "I love you too much to part with you. Allah
                     knows that it was you that planted the flower of love in my bosom."
                  But we need not record all the conversation that passed between them. Let it
                     suffice for us to say that when the Sultan arose to take his leave he found
                     that he could not cross the door sill. Something held him back. What was it? It
                     was the power—the enchantment of love. Oh! Cupid! what fools thou dost make of
                     us poor mortals.
               
               
                  
                  
                     
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Farewell! if ever fondest prayer
                              For other's weal wailed on high,
                              Mine will not all be lost in air,
                              But waft thy name beyond the sky."
                           
                        
                        LORD BYRON.
                     
                  
                  TORINDA.
                  IN a small, but splendidly furnished apartment, stood Torinda. She was alone It
                     was her bed chamber, and she was seated on a small cushion near the bed. Her
                     eyes gleamed with a strange unnatural light—her thoughts seemed far away. Ever
                     and anon she would rise from the cushion and walk rapidly to and fro. What was
                     she thinking of? Of her sunny vale wherein she had passed her youthful days? Of
                     the high mountain where, with her rifle, she had chased the wolf and the
                     antelope? Of the dark rolling river—the white gushing spring? Of her father's
                     castle—of her mother's kindness? No, no, her thoughts were not of these. She
                     was thinking of war. In imagination she was leading on a party of warriors—in
                     one hand she bore the banner of the Sultan—in the other a sabre. And now the
                     two hostile parties meet; and then comes the crashing of the cannons; the loud
                     shouts of the Turks mingled with the groans of the dying. Soon the smoke
                     surrounds them, and she sees nothing but wild figures rushing on each
                     other—then comes the clashing of the sabres, the shouts of the victorious, the
                     piercing shriek of the fife, the rolling din of the drum. Then the two parties
                     separate—one party pursuing the other. Then comes the cry of the victorious
                     Turks—the war cry of the Ottomans. Then comes the cry for mercy. Is it given?
                     No! Soon the defeated party is cut to pieces and the Turks return. At their
                     head is Torinda. The flag in her hand is dyed with blood—her face, her hands,
                     the sabre, her clothes, are all stained with blood. Her features wear a smile
                     of victory and of glory. And—before she could think further, the door opened
                     and Khatoun entered.
                  "The Sultan will be with you shortly," she said.
                  "Tell him that I shall be ready to receive him," said Torinda, a smile of love
                     playing over her features.
                  The slave left the room. Hardly had she done so when Torinda sprang from the
                     cushion.
                  "Yes!" said she, "I'll do it. Better to die a soldier's death or win a
                     soldier's fame, than live a coward's life—known to but a few—unknown to the
                     world. My religion—my adopted religion—teaches me that in case of a war the
                     women must fight as well as the men. Yes, I will do it, come what will—come
                     what may!"
                  For a few minutes she remained in deep thought.
                  "But," exclaimed she suddenly, "how am I to escape from the harem? I thought
                     not of that before!" and she gazed around the room. Suddenly her eye fell on a
                     suit of clothes which belonged to the Sultan. The cloth was very plain—they had
                     been made for him by an English tailor and in the English style. The thought
                     struck her that she might disguise herself in them and then it would be an easy
                     matter to escape from the harem. She drew them on—they fitted her exactly. She
                     then resumed her own dress. Her eye now fell on a sabre and a pair of richly
                     mounted pistols. At one end of the room stood a coffer containing drafts and an
                     enormous sum in gold. The coffer and its contents had been presented to her by
                     the Sultan.
                  "Allah has favored me," she said; "have I not everything I want—money, clothes,
                     arms? Surely I ought to thank Allah for his mercy," and she fell on her knees.
                     Not five minutes passed before a knock was heard at the door.
                  "Come in," said Torinda, and Khatoun entered.
                  "My lord wishes to know whether you are ready to receive him."
                  "Am I not his slave? Tell him that I am ready."
                  When the girl left the room Torinda drew out a small phial and poured a few
                     drops into a bottle of wine—she then replaced it.
                  
                  "Five drops, and the person who drinks it will fall asleep—ten drops and he
                     will be dead," muttered Torinda.
                  In a few minutes the door opened and the Sultan entered. He was attired in a
                     beautiful dressing gown; his feet were covered with a beautiful pair of
                     slippers; on his head he wore a magnificently embroidered night cap. On
                     entering the room he advanced towards Torinda with open arms.
                  "To the bower of roses, of which you are the queen," he said, with a smile.
                  "Will my lord take a glass of wine?" asked Torinda.
                  "Yes," said the Sultan; "for who would refuse to accept a glass from my
                     favorite wife?"
                  Torinda poured out a small glass and handed it to the Sultan, who drank it
                     without in silence.
                  "Come Torinda," said the Sultan, holding out his hands. Suddenly his eyes
                     closed, his hands fell, and he sank back upon the couch.
                  In five minutes Torinda was dressed in the Sultan's suit—the pistols concealed
                     in her bosom, and the sabre by her side. She then proceeded to fill her pockets
                     with bank notes and gold. When this was done she seated herself upon the couch
                     beside the Sultan.
                  "Oh! my lord, it is hard—very hard, to tear myself away from you, but I must,
                     for my adopted country demands it. Perhaps I shall never see you again. Perhaps
                     soon I may be lying upon the cold ground—dead. Oh, Allah! look down upon me and
                     harden my heart. Tear from it the love which I have for the Sultan, at least
                     for an hour. Thou knowest that I know not what fear is; but I do
                     know the magic power of love. Little did the daughter of Albia think that her
                     heart could love so warmly. I loved my parents with a daughter's love, but my
                     love for the Sultan is deeper, stronger, wilder. Oh Abd-ul, were I to lose thee
                     who could replace thee? None save my country's general, Omer Pasha. And yet my
                     love for him is nothing compared to my love for thee. I love him because on him
                     depends my country's hopes—on him and on my country's sons depend whether we
                     are to live free or die slaves. Allah, look down upon my lord and let thy
                     prophet Mahomet stand by his right hand and guide. Let his soldiers become
                     victorious, and I will ask not for more," and she covered her face with her
                     hands.
                  Five minutes passed—five long minutes. Nothing was heard but her sobs, and soon
                     they ceased. Rising once more, she kissed him on the forehead, and casting one
                     more look of love on him, she left the room.
                  On reaching the stairs she paused—what to do next she knew not, for she had not
                     resolved upon any very definite plan. After pausing a few minutes she resolved
                     to let things take their own course. Slowly she descended the stairs until she
                     reached the second floor. Here again she paused. To reach the door that led out
                     into the garden she would be obliged to pass through the sleeping apartment of
                     the chief eunuch, and should he awaken, what reply could she make to his
                     question? After hesitating a moment she laid her hand on the door and turned
                     the knob. Slowly the door rolled back, revealing to her the apartment, which
                     was brilliantly illuminated. The eunuch was lying on a sofa. Was he asleep or
                     awake? The former, perhaps, for he did not move in the least. Drawing her
                     sabre, Torinda closed the door and crept slowly along to the opposite side of
                     the room. Keenly did she gaze on the face of the eunuch as she passed, and
                     great was her joy when she discovered that he was really asleep. She reached
                     the door without noise and opened it. Hardly was this done when a bell tinkled.
                     At once Torinda discovered that a cord had been placed across the sill so as to
                     cause the bell to tinkle whenever any one either left or entered the palace.
                     She glanced into the room and saw that the eunuch was springing from the bed
                     and rushing to the door with a drawn sabre in his hand. Knowing that if she
                     attempted to escape him he would give the alarm, she placed her back against
                     the wall, and grasping her sabre with a tighter grasp she prepared to sell her
                     life dearly. Hardly was this done when the eunuch appeared.
                  "Who are you—and what want you in the Sultan's harem?" cried the eunuch.
                  "Look," said Torinda, as she moved her cap and suffered her magnificent curls
                     to appear. "Now you know me, do you not?"
                  "Torinda!" cried the eunuch, turning pale as death, for well he knew the
                     consequence of suffering any one to pass through his chamber at night.
                  "Aye, Torinda," said our heroine, "Suffer me to pass without molestation, for
                     well you know that whether I escape or not your doom is sealed."
                  "I know it," said the eunuch, sadly; "but I would rather fall beneath your
                     sword than meet the Sultan's wrath. Strike!"
                  "I will," said Torinda—and drawing back her arm she motioned to the eunuch to
                     hold his head up straight. With a sad smile he obeyed. The sword descended
                     quickly but surely upon his neck, and the head rolled from the body to the
                     ground. After wiping the blade of her sabre, Torinda turned to depart. It was
                     then that the thought struck her that she had no horse to ride to the camp.
                  "I must have a horse at all hazards," she muttered; "But I forgot. I have
                     plenty of money, and a horse can be purchased any time. And now to get over the
                     wall."
                  In a few minutes Torinda stood safe on the other side of the wall. She knew
                     that the army lay in a northern direction, yet how to reach it was a mystery
                     that she could not fathom. She determined to inquire of the first passer by. At
                     length she heard a heavy footstep approaching, and on looking up the street,
                     she saw a man advancing towards her.
                  "Friend," said she, stepping out, "how can I reach the army?"
                  "I do not speak your language," said the man, in English.
                  Torinda was as well acquainted with the English language as with her own.
                  "I wish to reach the army," she said, in English.
                  "Ah! you are an Englishman?" said he, interrogatively.
                  "No, I am a native of this country."
                  "You speak our language well, at any rate," said the man. "The best way to
                     reach the army is to sail as far as Burgas, and then ride on horseback the rest
                     of the way. If I were in your place I would ride the whole way.
                  "Why?" asked Torinda.
                  Because a horse travels faster than a vessel sails. If you are poor, however,
                     and wish to save money, I advise you to sail. I am the captain of as fleet a
                     vessel as ever sailed the Black Sea, and have as gallant a crew under me as
                     ever drew triggers or hoisted sail."
                  "When do you sail?" asked Torinda.
                  "To-night," replied the other. "Even now my crew are waiting for me."
                  "And will you suffer me to go with you,?"
                  "Certainly, if you will," replied the other, as he caught sight of the
                     magnificent emerald which Torinda wore on her right finger.
                  "Let us go then," said Torinda. And they walked forward.
                  "How long have you been a captain?" asked Torinda.
                  "Count the fingers of your right hand, leaving out the thumb," said the other.
                     "Yes; for four years have I sailed the Black Sea as a captain, and three years
                     as a mate."
                  "I presume that your vessel is a large one," said Torinda.
                  "No, quite the contrary," replied the other. "She rates at about two hundred
                     tons. If the war continues I intend to change her for a larger vessel the first
                     chance I get."
                  "The war will continue so long as the Emperor of Russia continues to press his
                     demands upon Turkey," said Torinda.
                  "I am glad to hear it," said the other. "A long war and plenty of prizes will
                     make me happy."
                  By this time they had reached the shore. The captain looked about him for a few
                     minutes, and then picking up three large stones he threw them into the water
                     one after the other. This appeared to be a signal, for a boat immediately put
                     out from a small cove, and soon the bow grazed the beach.
                  "Jump on," said the captain, and as Torinda obeyed he gave the boat a push with
                     his foot and sprang in.
                  "Row cherrily, men," said he. "From what I heard to-night, I am afraid that the
                     hounds are in pursuit, and the sooner we reach the schooner the better."
                  "Which is the schooner?" asked Torinda.
                  "Do you see that vessel?" said the captain, pointing to a beautiful little
                     schooner that lay nearly a mile from the shore. "That is the schooner which I
                     have the honor to command."
                  In a quarter of an hour they reached the schooner; a rope was thrown to them
                     and the captain fastened it in a small iron ring in the bow of the boat. Then
                     springing on the deck he offered Torinda his hand, and as her feet touched the
                     deck he doffed his cap, and with a low bow, said:
                  
                  "Hoist up the black flag, my men, and welcome, young man, on board the pirate
                     vessel of which I have the honor to be captain!"
                  On hearing these words, Torinda started back in astonishment, and then drawing
                     her sabre she walked backwards to the mass and leaned against it.
                  "Do you mean to harm me?" she asked.
                  "Harm you," replied the other, "and what have you done to me that I should
                     raise my hand against you? No, no, young man, although I am a rover of the sea,
                     and although I carry the scull and cross-bones at my mast-head, I would not
                     harm you for the world. I promised you a safe passage to Burgas, and I intend,
                     if nothing happens, to keep my word.
                  Torinda stood for a moment as though irresolute.
                  "Perhaps you mean to play me false," she said, at length.
                  "Do you doubt my word?" said the rover, sternly.
                  "I do!" cried Torinda, boldly.
                  "By heavens! young man!" cried the rover, "I'll force the words down your
                     throat, and throw your body to the sharks. What! ho! there, my men, disarm him,
                     and throw him into the sea. I saw a shark swimming beneath the bow of the
                     schooner just now."
                  With loud shouts the men sprang forward and attempted to obey the orders of
                     their leader. Torinda extended her sabre towards them and for a moment kept
                     them back.
                  "Back!" she cried, in that calm voice which overawes all who hear it—the voice
                     of despair. "He who seeks to cut me down will perish in the attempt."
                  The men hesitated, and cast a glance at their leader.
                  "What!" cried the latter, drawing his sword, "is it possible that one man can
                     keep you in check? Stand out of the way knaves, and let me at him!"
                  "Stop!" cried Torinda, as her eye fell on the pirate's sword and then again
                     upon his features. Is it possible that Edward Wilks has forgotten his
                     oath?"
                  On hearing that name the pirate started back.
                  "Who are you?" he cried, in a hollow voice.
                  "Torinda! the daughter of Albia, your early friend," said Torinda, dropping the
                     point of her sword to the deck. One of the men observed the action, and
                     thinking that his leader would thank him for obeying his orders, sprang forward
                     and raised his weapon. In an instant Torinda raised her sabre, and before the
                     pirate could get out of the way or defend himself his arm was severed from his
                     body.
                  "Served him right!" cried the leader. "By heaven! if any dare to lift his arm
                     against her, I'll blow his brains out!" and he drew a pistol from his belt.
                  "The man was only obeying your orders," said one of the pirates.
                  "What's that?" cried the captain, and cocking his pistol, he aimed it at the
                     other and fired. To his surprise, the pirate remained unhurt.
                  "Remember your oaths, men!" cried he, drawing his sword and springing towards
                     the captain. With a grim smile the latter received him, and making a signal
                     with his fingers, the other sailors sprang upon and disarmed him.
                  "So you thought to throw me overboard and become captain, eh?" rover. "I knew
                     it all from the beginning, even to the drawing the bullets out of my pistols.
                     Then! what shall we do with him?"
                  "Hang him!" cried the crew.
                  "Two much trouble," said the captain. "A charge of powder will not be wasted by
                     sending him out of the world."
                  The men understood the 
                        himt
                        hint
                     , and in a few minutes several reports and a splash in the sea told
                     the captain that the mutineer was no more.
                  "Thus perish all that dare to raise their hand against their captain," said the
                     pirate; "but come, Torinda, let us descend to the cabin."
                  In five minutes they were seated in the cabin.
                  "How is it, Torinda, asked the captain, "that you recognise me?"
                  "By your sword, Edward," replied Torinda. "I knew it at the first glance."
                  "And well have I used the present," said the rover, with a bitter smile. "Oh!
                     little did I think, Torinda to meet with you again—at least, under the present
                     circumstances. Your boyish lover is now the dreaded rover of the black Sea:
                     you—what are you?"
                  "The Sultan's wife," said Torinda.
                  "But your father—what has become of him? Does he still live in the old
                     castle?"
                  "His ashes are there, but he is not."
                  "What! is he dead?" cried the pirate. Torinda bowed her head in the
                     affirmative.
                  "And your mother, where is she?"
                  "Dead," replied Torinda. "The same hand that slew my father slew him."
                  The pirate wiped away a tear from his eye.
                  "May the foul fiend wither the hand that slew them!" he cried.
                  "I have avenged them," said Torinda, exultingly. "Aye, the murderer fell
                     beneath my hand!" and she related to the rover what the reader has already
                     read.
                  "Torinda," said the pirate, "I, too, have borne and suffered much, but my
                     history is too long to be told here. Rememberest thou, when in our youthful
                     days we scaled the mountains and ventured where no human being had trod before?
                     Rememberest thou when we slept together in the little cot beneath thy parents
                     bed? Rememberest thou when we chased the wolf and the other wild animals of the
                     forest? Rememberest thou when we practiced shooting, fencing, leaping, jumping,
                     and other manly sports? Aye! and often didst thou beat me in them. Dost not the
                     memory of the past bring thee bright visions of the future?"
                  "It does," was the reply.
                  "Then what say you, Torinda, will you become the rover's bride? I have as
                     galant a ship and crew as ever crossed the ocean wave. Worthy, worthy art thou
                     to command them: aye, and thou shalt if thou wilt but accede to my
                     proposition.
                  "I cannot," said Torinda, "for I have a lover already."
                  "Then throw him off!" said the captain. "Away with the sluggardness of a
                     landman's life, for though thou art a woman, thou wast born to do great deeds.
                     Thou wast born to win a name of glory—thou wast born to be a conqueror. Like
                     Joan of Arc thou wast born to lead armies! Torinda, I offer you all—my ship, my
                     crew, myself. Take them and win a name of fame!"
                  "I cannot become a pirate's bride," said Torinda. "My destiny is otherwise. My
                     country needs my aid and she shall have it. Where on this fair earth is there a
                     brighter land? Where in this broad universe can braver sons and daughters be
                     found? Look on our bright flag, the figure on it betrays at once our religion
                     and our country! Aye! it is the crescent that leads our armies on to battle! It
                     is the crescent under which they will gain their victories! It is the crescent
                     under which they will die!"
                  "But Turkey is not your country," said the rover.
                  "It is my adopted country," was the reply.
                  "A person cannot love his adopted country," said the other.
                  "Why not? Does not a woman love her adopted child—a father his adopted
                     son?"
                  "True, true," said the other, "but will you accept my offer?
                  "I cannot," replied Torinda;" my reason I stated before.
                  "And who is he?" asked the pirate, with curiosity.
                  "Abd-el," was the reply.
                  "What he!" cried the pirate chief, his eyes flashing with scorn, "a poor,
                     meddling, pitiful, drivelling fool! What he your husband! he who has a hundred
                     wives already. Curses on him that he should win the heart of my early
                     love!"
                  "Peace!" cried Torinda.
                  "A fool who knows not how to manage his own affairs, but must hire others to
                     manage them for him! A man—can I call him by that name—who passes his time in
                     talking of love to his numerous wives. Why does he not imitate the example of
                     Saladin the Great and lead his armies on to battle. Rather, Torinda, would I
                     see you the wife of Nicholas of Russia than his!"
                  "Dare say that again!" cried Torinda, "and I will forget that we are friends
                     and hew you limb from limb!"
                  The rover sank into a chair and drew his hand over his brow. Suddenly he
                     started up.
                  "Torinda," said he, "do not make me use force in this matter."
                  "Force!" cried Torinda, "and will the pirate chief—my 'early love'—break his
                     oaths?"
                  The pirate arose and drawing his cutlass from the scabbard he threw it to the
                     further corner of the room.
                  "You will drive me mad!" he said.
                  "Then leave me," said Torinda. "My temper is as quick as yours, my passions are
                     as strong—but you have forgotten to give the order for sailing."
                  "Ah! and you are in danger of pursuit. What ho! up there on deck! Up with the anchor and sails!
                     crowd in all the canvass the schooner can carry. Keep the vessel in sight of
                     land! Set her head in the direction of Burgas!"
                  When he had given the orders he turned to Torinda.
                  "Let us be friends," he said, extending his hand as he spoke. Torinda took it
                     and shook it warmly. "To night," continued the captain, "It will tell you my
                     history from the time I left you till now. It is a strange—a startling history
                     which even you will acknowledge to be so when you hear it. It is of war—of
                     captivity—of vengeance—of crime—of bloody and daring scenes. I will show you
                     how I came to be a freebooter—how my hand came to be raised against every one
                     and every man's hand against me; but I must attend to the vessel now," and
                     saying this he left the cabin.
                  "I must try and get him to join us," thought Torinda. "Yes, although a
                     free-booter he would be a valuable acquisition to our side—but who is that
                     speaking? As I live 'tis the voice of Mesrour—and—" before she could proceed
                     farther, the door of the cabin opened and the captain entered.
                  "Hide yourself—here, in this closet." he said, and touching a spring in the
                     wall a secret door flew open. In an instant she sprang through and the door
                     closed behind her; hardly had it done so when Mesrour the slave and Mahoud the
                     mute followed by a party of soldiers entered the cabin.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "As some lone bird, without a mate,
                              My weary heart is desolate;
                              I look around, and cannot trace
                              One friendly smile or welcome face;
                              And even in crowds am still alone,
                              Because I cannot love but one."
                           
                        
                        LORD BYRON.
                     
                  
                  THE SULTAN AWAKENS FROM HIS DEEP SLEEP—THE SEARCH—THE
                     DISCOVERY—THE SULTAN'S GRIEF—HIS STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE.
                  It was several hours ere the Sultan awoke from the deep sleep in which the
                     draught administered by Torinda had thrown him. His first sensation was a
                     headache—his next a strange taste in his mouth. After lying still for a few
                     moments, he stretched out his hand. Where was Torinda? In vain he placed his
                     hand in her usual place—she was not there. So astonished was he for a moment
                     that he remained motionless. At length, somewhat recovering from his
                     astonishment, he sprang from the bed and called loudly on his guards. Mahoud,
                     the mute, was the first to enter the room.
                  "Where is Torinda?" asked the Sultan.
                  The mute shook his head in a manner which implied that he did not know, while
                     his features exhibited the utmost surprise.
                  "Is she in the garden?" asked the Sultan.
                  Again the slave shook his head.
                  "Did she leave the harem?" asked the Sultan. The mute folded his arms. "You do
                     not know?" asked the Sultan interrogatively. The mute shook his head.
                  At this moment the door opened and Mesrour entered the room.
                  "Where is Torinda?" asked the Sultan.
                  "I do not know, your Majesty," replied the slave, holding up his hands in
                     astonishment.
                  "Search the garden!" cried the Sultan—"wait!" he added; "I will go with you.
                     Bring a lamp with you, Mesrour. Mahoud, you will go with us," and grasping his
                     sword, the three men left the room.
                  "She is not here," said the Sultan, after examining several of the rooms. "Let
                     us go below," and they descended the stairs. On reaching the door of the
                     eunuch's room, the Sultan flung it open. As we said before, the room was
                     brilliantly lighted. One glance showed the Sultan that the room was empty. They
                     then proceeded to
                      the garden. Here Mesrour discovered
                     the body lying on a small plat, and the head a little distance off.
                  "Who has done this?" cried the Sultan, his voice choking with rage and grief,
                     for he prized the eunuch greatly.
                  Mahoud looked up inquiringly.
                  "What is it?" asked the Sultan, as he scanned his features attentively.
                  Mahoud reached out his left hand as though he held a sabre in it, and then
                     pointed to the one which the Sultan held in his hand.
                  "My sabre," said the Sultan—"ah, you mean the companion to this one. What makes
                     you think so?"
                  Mahoud pointed to the body, and then made a rapid motion with his arm.
                  "Ah, you mean that the head was cut off at a single blow, and that no sabre in
                     the country could have done it excepting the two belonging to me."
                  Mahoud shook his head significantly in the affirmative.
                  "You are right," said the Sultan; "The head was cut off at a single blow. But
                     who has done it?"
                  The mute laid his hand upon his heart as though embracing some one, and then
                     closed his eyes.
                  "Torinda?" asked the Sultan.
                  The mute bowed his head.
                  "Yes, it must have been her," said the Sultan, in a musing voice; "and yet I do
                     not feel angry with her. But why—that is the question—why did she do it?"
                  "I do not know, my lord, said Mesrour. "Perhaps she has returned to her own
                     country. Perhaps the eunuch attempted to detain her and she slew him."
                  "Yes, that must be it," said the Sultan. "I am sorry—deeply sorry—that she is
                     gone. Sooner would I have parted with half of my dominions than that she had
                     left me thus. But Allah's will be done," and he bowed his head upon his
                     breast.
                  "My lord," said Mesrour, "if you will permit me, I will search the whole city
                     until find her."
                  On hearing this, the mute raised his head.
                  "What is it, Mahoud?" asked the Sultan.
                  The black waved his hands slowly to and fro, and then made a hissing noise with
                     his mouth.
                  "I do not understand you." said the Sultan.
                  Mahoud made his hand move as though he were swimming.
                  "He means for us to search the vessels in the harbor," said Mesrour.
                  "Here," said the Sultan, drawing a ring from his finger, "take a party of men
                     and search every vessel—every one, mind you—do not pass any without searching
                     it—not even my own vessels. Show the signet to the captains, and should any
                     resist, shoot them. Away!"
                  When the Sultan was again seated in his chamber, he gave way to a flood of
                     tears. This somewhat relieved him.
                  "Oh! Torinda, flower of my heart, pride of my harem—why didst thou leave me?
                     Did Allah send thee from the sky to give me a few happy hours?—to make me taste
                     the joys of paradise?—to show me what a houri is? Yes, it must be so; but oh!
                     Torinda! if thy spirit is near me—if thou art now inhaling my breath—speak and
                     whisper a few words of consolation in my ear. Tell me that thou art near
                     me—that thy breath is fanning my cheek. A blast, deadly as that of the simoon
                     of the desert, has passed over my heart—will it ever pass away? Allah only
                     knows," and the Sultan again wept.
                  It was many days ere the Sultan recovered from his loss. Recovered did we say?
                     No, he never could recover from so great a loss as this. A deep melancholy
                     settled over his features, and the once strong man was now wasted away to a
                     shadow. In vain did the inmates of the harem try to distract his mind from his
                     thoughts, which were constantly of Torinda; but days and weeks passed and she
                     appeared not. One day the Sultan disappeared, and many weeks passed ere he was
                     found. Search was made for him throughout the city, but he could not be found.
                     Then the servants returned to the palace, and passed their days in anxious
                     silence, dreading lest they should hear the news of his death—trembling lest he
                     should return. Mesrour commanded that the strictest secrecy should be observed
                     in regard to the Sultan's absence; and the inhabitants of the city little
                     imagined that their Sultan was—where? No one knew.
                  And now, reader, we must return to the vessel commanded by Wilks, the
                     pirate.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Then the pirates of Parga, that dwell by the waves,
                              And teach the pale Franks what it is to be slaves,
                              Shall leave on the beach the long galley and oar,
                              And track to his covert the captive on shore.
                              I ask not the pleasures that riches supply,
                              My sabre shall win what the weaker must buy;
                              Shall win the fair bride with her long flowing hair,
                              And many a maid from her mother shall tear.
                           
                        
                        LORD BYRON.
                     
                  
                  THE SEARCH—THE CAPTAIN'S STORY—A TALE OF BLOOD—THE PIRATE'S OATH
                     OF VENGEANCE—HOW HE KEPT HIS OATH.
                  At the conclusion of our third chapter we stated that the pirate chief touched
                     a spring in the wall, and that a secret door flew open; that Torinda sprang
                     through the door, and that it closed behind her; and hardly had it done so,
                     when Mesrour, the slave, and Mahoud, the mute, followed by a party of soldiers,
                     entered the cabin. The reader will thus see that all the following events take
                     place on the same evening.
                  "What is your pleasure?" said the pirate, as he stepped to the middle of the
                     cabin.
                  "We have come to search your vessel," replied Mesrour, casting a rapid glance
                     around him.
                  "Bear you the Sultan's order?" asked the captain.
                  "Yes," replied Mesrour.
                  "For whom are you looking?" asked the rover.
                  "For Torinda, the Sultan's slave," replied Mesrour. "Have we your permission to
                     search the cabin, or must we do so by force?"
                  "Am I not the Sultan's slave?—bear you not his signet? How, then can I resist
                     the authority of the Commander of the Faithful. Search, and glad will it make
                     my heart if you find her; although I know she is not here.
                  Mesrour waved his hand, and the soldiers began the search. Old boxes and
                     barrels were opened; things that had not seen daylight for many years were
                     brought out, in short the cabin was turned, to use a homely expression,
                     topsy-turvy. Still, however, the search was unavailing, and almost choked by
                     the dust, Mesrour waved his hand as a sign to the soldiers to depart.
                  "I am sorry that I have put you to so much trouble," said Mesrour.
                  "And I am sorry that I cannot help you to find her," said the captain. "Give me
                     a description of the girl. Was she pretty?"
                  "See you yon moon?" said Mesrour; "can you find another like it? No. Imagine
                     then, the beauty of the Sultan's favorite, when another like her cannot be
                     found."
                  "If I should happen to come across her," said the captain, "I will send you
                     word and let you know. I presume that the Sultan will amply reward the person
                     that finds her."
                  "Even to the half of his possessions," said Mesrour.
                  We must here inform the reader that Mesrour could speak English nearly as good
                     as Torinda.
                  "Phew!" whistled the captain, "I must try and get that reward." And as Mesrour
                     ascended the stairs he muttered to himself, "I have tasted the bowstring once,
                     and I would rather be devoured by a shark than get the cord around my neck
                     again."
                  While the search was going on, the schooner had been sailing slowly along at
                     the rate of five knots an hour. When Mesrour and the soldiers got into the boat
                     a sharp breeze sprung up, and filling the sails, caused the vessel to bound
                     through the water like a bird upon the wing.
                  "Come, Torinda," said the rover, as he opened the door. "all is safe. The fools
                     searched for you a long time, but they gave it up at last. Ah! they ought to
                     thank their Prophet that they found you not."
                  
                  "Why?" asked Torinda.
                  "Why, sooner than permit any one to take a bird from under my wing I would blow
                     up the vessel and all in it," replied the captain.
                  "Then your last deed would be worthy of your life," said Torinda.
                  "Aye, it would," said the pirate; "but I promised you my history. Set you down
                     beside me and listen.
                  I am, as you know already, a native of England. Some love the land of their
                     birth—I, the pirate chief, hate mine. Some look with joy over the history of
                     their country—over the deeds of her sons. I have no such feeling. Often have I
                     cursed the land of my birth, and with good reason, as you will learn hereafter.
                     There is but one flag that I love, and that is the cross-bones and skull. I am
                     wedded to a pirate's life, and who made me so? The poets of my—England. Oh!
                     Torinda, rememberest thou those lines by Byron so descriptive of a rover's
                     life? 
                        
                           O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,
                           Our thoughts as boundless, and our souls as free,
                           Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam,
                           Survey our empire, and behold our home!
                           These are our realms, no limit to their sway—
                           Our flag the sceptre all who meet obey.
                           Ours the wild life in tumult still to range
                           From toil to rest, and joy in every change.
                           Oh, who can tell? not thou, luxurious slave!
                           Whose soul would sicken o'er the heaving wave;
                           Not thou, vain lord of wantonness and ease!
                           Whom slumber sooths not—pleasure cannot please
                           Oh, who can tell, save he whose heart hath tried,
                           And danced in triumph o'er the waters wide,
                           The exulting sense—the pulse's maddening play,
                           That thrills the wanderer of that trackless way.
                           
                           No dread of death—if with us die our foes—
                           Save that it seems even duller than repose:
                           Come when it will—we snatch the life of life—
                           When lost—what recks it—by disease or, strife?"
                        
                     
                  
                  "I remember them well," said Torinda; "but proceed with your history."
                  "I will," said the pirate, "but I wish to repeat a few lines more—hear them." 
                        
                           "Set the canister ready, and then bring to me,
                           For the last of my dukes, the powder room key.
                           It shall never be lowered—the black flag we bear,
                           If the sea be denied us, we will sweep through the air."
                        
                     
                  
                  And now to my story. My father, as you know already, was very wealthy. He
                     traveled much, and merely for amusement. With him have I scaled the Alps of
                     Switzerland, the Mountains of the Moon in Africa, the Andes of South America,
                     the Rocky Mountains of North America, the Caucassian Mountains, the Ural
                     Mountains, that divide Europe and Asia. I have crossed the Pyrennees of France,
                     I have traveled among the green hills of Scotland, I have drank of the Geysers
                     of Iceland. Aye, I have traveled far and suffered much, more than some beings
                     that I know could bear.
                  When we bade adieu to your family, we set sail for England. We had a very quick
                     passage, and arrived there safe and sound. My father purchased a house in the
                     neighborhood of Hyde Park, London. He had it fitted up in the best style, and
                     there for some months we lived alone, contented and happy.
                  A few doors from us resided a family by the name of Sycamore. They were said to
                     be very rich, and of course, very respectable. A poor man in England, be he
                     ever so well educated, is thought nothing of—a fool with plenty of money and
                     little brains is courted and caressed. This family, no doubt, heard of my
                     father—heard of his great wealth, and they resolved to win his
                     acquaintance.
                  One morning, as my father was reading a paper, the servant entered and handed
                     him a note. It was an invitation from the Sycamores requesting him to attend a
                     social party at their house, and to bring his son with him. My father wrote a
                     suitable note in the affirmative. That evening we attended the party, and my
                     father was introduced to Julia Sycamore, the eldest daughter. To cut the story
                     short, I will say that he fell deeply in love—asked, and was accepted—and in
                     three months he married her.
                  Not many weeks passed before my step-mother began to treat me with unusual
                     severity. I was too proud to complain of it to my father, and bore her
                     ill-treatment in silence. Soon things began to be missed; and one day my
                     father's watch disappeared. My mother suspected that I was the thief, and told
                     my father as much. My father called me to him and bade me to confess the crime.
                     I refused, because I was innocent. My father flogged me, and then sent me,
                     supperless, to bed. As I passed by my step-mother, I saw a strange smile on her
                     lips. Boy, though I was, I understood it at once. I rushed up the stairs and
                     entered my bed chamber. In a few minutes my step-mother followed me. She closed
                     the door, locked it, and then advanced to my bedside.
                  "Edward," said she, in that low musical voice which Satan assumed when he
                     tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, "what have you done with your father's
                     watch?"
                  I made no reply.
                  "Oh! Edward," said my mother, as she clasped her hands, while the crocodile
                     tears rolled down her cheeks, "confess that you took it at once. Your father
                     will then, I am sure, forgive you; and when your conscience is eased of the
                     crime, your heart will be light once more.
                  "Madam," said I, for I could not call her by the sainted name of mother, "I do
                     not know where the watch is. Had you not better ask your brother where it is?
                     Perhaps you took it yourself."
                  On hearing this she uttered a loud scream and fainted. Instead of rising from
                     the bed, I watched her in silence. Her face was turned towards me. Suddenly I
                     saw her eyes open. When she caught mine fixed on hers, she closed them again.
                     Thus we lay for several moments. By and bye the door opened and my father
                     entered."
                  "What is the matter, Julia?" he asked, in astonishment.
                  My mother again burst into tears.
                  "I came to request Edward to confess that he took the watch, and to ask your
                     forgiveness for doing so."
                  "Well?" said my father, seeing that she paused.
                  "And he struck me."
                  "By the great God above us!" cried I, springing from the bed, "she lies! For
                     some purpose known only to herself and to God, she is seeking my ruin! Father,
                     I am your only child, can you believe what that woman says?"
                  "Woman!" cried my father, "call her mother!"
                  "Sooner would I perish than call her by that name!" I cried. "Mother! she's no
                     mother of mine. What have I done that she should try to ruin me?" and I stamped
                     with my foot upon the floor.
                  "Oh! husband," said the woman, with another burst of crocodile tears, "do not
                     whip him—he knows not what he says."
                  "Boy," said my father, pointing to the floor, "kneel down and beg your mother's
                     forgiveness."
                  "Rather let her kneel!" was my reply. "Let her ask my forgiveness, and all will
                     be well."
                  It was enough. My father raised his hand and struck me a blow that laid me
                     senseless and bleeding on the floor.
                  Three months passed. I was an outcast and a wanderer upon the wide world. The
                     woman had succeeded in her plans—she had made me homeless. Oh, God! it makes my
                     brain crush beneath the weight of agony to think of it—but ah! I thank Him who
                     made me that the hour of vengeance came!
                  I joined a party of smugglers. At the age of nineteen, I became their leader. I
                     was the most successful smuggler on the coast, and many attempts were made by
                     the revenue cutters to capture me; but they failed. My many successful trips
                     brought me enormous sums of money. The crew were delighted with their captain,
                     and they implicitly obeyed my orders. Months passed on; I grew rich. One day,
                     after making a very successful trip, I called my crew together, and told them
                     to find another captain. The news was received with consternation. Nowhere,
                     could they find so successful a leader as I had been. I silenced their murmurs
                     with a large sum of money and by promising them that I would soon return. As I
                     descended into the boat the poor fellows gave me three cheers. I could not
                     reply, for I was weeping. Aye! the pirate, of the Black sea could weep
                     then.
                  I entered the stage coach and set out for London. When I arrived at the
                     metropolis I went directly to my father's house. The blinds were closed, and
                     there was a gloomy silence. I rang the bell, and soon the door opened and a
                     servant appeared. I knew him at once for my father's favorite servant.
                  
                  "Monts," said I. He uttered a cry of surprise. "Hush!" said I, "I am Edward
                     Wilks. How is my father?"
                  The old man wiped the tears from his eyes, as he replied in a solemn voice—
                  "Dead!"
                  On hearing that single word it appeared to me as though a hot iron passed
                     through my heart. With a countenance blended with horror and astonishment, I
                     repeated the word—
                  "Dead!"
                  "Yes," said the servant, "he died yesterday."
                  "Ha!" said I, "then his body is in the house now?"
                  "Yes, in the drawing room."
                  "Can I see him without being seen myself?" I asked.
                  "Yes," replied the servant. "None of the family are at home excepting Mrs.
                     Wilks, and she acts as though she was afraid to stay in the room alone."
                  "Old man!" cried I, "think you that my father was—" I could not speak the
                     word.
                  "As I hope for eternal salvation," said the old man solemnly, "I do believe
                     that he was poisoned."
                  "Enough," said I, "take me to the drawing room."
                  The coffin was standing on two stools. I approached it, and saw the pale, noble
                     features of one I had so tenderly loved. Though cold in death, his eyes were
                     open and fixed on me, as I thought, with a cold, glassy stare. His features
                     were strangely distorted, as though he had died violently. The servant's
                     suspicion came over me, and I knew at once that he had been poisoned. A slight
                     noise in the room caused me to turn, and I beheld the object of my suspicions
                     standing near me.
                  "What do you want here?" she asked, for she did not recognize me.
                  "Look!" cried I, throwing off my cap, "do you know me now?" and I gazed at her
                     with that look which Satan bestowed upon the Archangel Michael when he
                     fell.
                  "My God! it is Edward!" she said, as she fell fainting in a chair.
                  "Aye, I am Edward Wilks! the son of the man you murdered! You triumphed over me
                     once! it is my turn now!"
                  The woman gazed on me with horror: her lips moved slightly, but she could not
                     speak; the fearful heaving of that breast showed the agony that was working in
                     her heart.
                  "My hour of triumph has come!" said I; "but fear not, you shall not die by my
                     hand. No! you shall die by the hand of the public executioner!"
                  "No, not that! not that!" she cried, in a voice of agony.
                  "My father's death demands it!" said I;—but why extend the tale. She was
                     arrested and thrown into prison. In vain they—her friends—bribed the judge and
                     the jury: she was found guilty, and sentenced to be executed. How I laughed
                     with joy when I saw her trembling form borne back to prison. As she passed me
                     she bent her face towards me for mercy:—mercy! I gave it! ha! ha! The same
                     mercy that she showed to my father, I showed her! "The measure that we mete out
                     to others, shall be measured unto us again."
                  The night before the execution I visited her. She was lying on a couch. Her
                     face once so redolent with the hue of health was now pale as death. Her
                     features were haggard, and she was worn away to a skeleton. As I entered, she
                     raised her head.
                  "I have come," said I, with a smile that Satan would have envied. "I have come
                     to bid you adieu. To-morrow you will be lying in the coffin which the
                     undertakers are now making for you;" and I laughed with savage glee. Oh! none
                     but those who have suffered as I have can tell the deep joy that reigned in my
                     bosom then.
                  "Yes," I continued, "as I passed through the prison yard I saw the scaffold
                     going up. I saw the trap door through which you are to fall; the rope with
                     which you are to be hanged."
                  "Oh! spare me! spare me!" she cried.
                  "Spare you!" said I; "oh! no, no. Think you that now the hour of vengeance is
                     come that I will not enjoy it?"
                  "Look on me," she cried. "See how I have suffered. The burning fires of agony
                     and remorse—of hell—are burning in my heart."
                  "The past is terrible," said I; "the future still more so. To-morrow comes the
                     execution: after death comes the judgment."
                  "Let me hear no more!" she cried. "What right have you to torment me thus?"
                  "What right!" I repeated. "Who was it that poisoned the mind of my father
                     against me? Who was it that turned me from the door; that ruined all the bright
                     visions of my childhood days? Who was it that branded me with the name of
                     thief? Who was it that poisoned my father? Who is it that will suffer to-morrow
                     on the gallows? Who is it that will ere to-morrow night be in hell? Can
                     you—dare you answer my questions?"
                  The woman made no reply, but fell back on the bed: she had fainted. I called
                     the jailer, and then left the cell.
                  That evening I proceeded to the executioner's house: he was at home. I offered
                     him a large sum of money if he would let me take his place the following day:
                     he consented. I remained at his house all night. The next morning the sheriff
                     came, and placing a mask over my face I set out for the prison, which I soon
                     reached. As the executioner had given me directions how to proceed, I went
                     immediately to the cell. The sheriff and some others belonging to the prison
                     were there. I tied the arms of the prisoner behind her, and we set out for the
                     scaffold. The chaplain of the prison walked on one side of her—I on the other.
                     The chaplain, a tall, fine looking man, was whispering what he called "Sweet
                     words of comfort," in her ear; but she heeded him not, for her thoughts were
                     far away. Soon we reached the gallows. We lifted her up the steps—for she could
                     not walk—and I placed the rope around her neck. The executioner had forgotten
                     to inform me how the rope was tied, and I, of course, tied it the wrong way.
                     The chaplain mumbled over a prayer or two, and I seized the axe to knock away
                     the drop. At this moment my mask fell off—was it by accident?—and
                     the woman saw my face. How I looked at that moment, no one can tell. I placed
                     the mask over my face, and raising the axe I gave the drop a blow. In an
                     instant she was struggling in the air. Generally, the struggle lasts two
                     minutes; in this it lasted thirty. The crowd stood paralyzed with
                     horror. Oh! it was a fearful sight to that dark, deep, moving mass, and that
                     woman on whom their gaze was fixed, struggling on the gallows. The sheriff and
                     his officers turned pale with fear. They had reason to be afraid, for that dark
                     mass was slowly moving towards them.
                  "For Heaven's sake end this," said the sheriff, while his whole frame shook
                     with terror.
                  "How—how?" I asked, wishing to prolong the struggle as long as possible.
                  "Any way," cried the sheriff—"quick, quick!"
                  Making one spring into the air, I caught her by the feet and hung on. The
                     people below uttered a cry of horror and indignation; but they saw it was the
                     only thing that could be done. In a few minutes the struggles ceased, and all
                     was over.
                  Months passed away. One day as I was passing near the Thames, I was seized by a
                     press gang and hurried on board H. M. ship Duke of York. In a week we set sail
                     for the Mediterranean Sea. While lying off the coast of Italy, I managed to
                     make my escape. I then resolved to visit the castle wherein I had passed so
                     many happy days. Accordingly I set sail for Turkey in a schooner. None of the
                     crew were good sailors; many of them—for they always carry three or four dozen
                     men to attack and rob other vessels whenever they get a chance—were drunk more
                     than half the time. The captain found out that I was a sailor and that I
                     understood navigation better than he did. He handed me his charts and ordered
                     me to take command of the vessel. I obeyed. Soon we passed the straits of
                     Messina. Hardly had the land disappeared from our view when we were chased by a
                     pirate. I ordered the crew to arm themselves and be prepared for an attack.
                     Instead of obeying me they fell on their knees and called on the holy Virgin to
                     help them. This made me so angry that I kicked the captain overboard, and
                     drawing my cutlass, I sprang among the sailors and drove them below. The pirate
                     vessel was now within hail.
                  "Have you surrendered?" cried a voice, that had something familiar in it, but
                     for the life of me I could not recollect where I had heard it before.
                  "Yes," I replied. "Come on board and take possession;" and seizing the flag I
                     pulled it down and threw it overboard.
                  "All hands prepare for boarding!" cried the same voice, and as the pirate
                     grazed the side of the schooner a dozen or more men sprang on board. One or
                     them—the captain—sprang towards me with a drawn cutlass. Perceiving this
                     movement, I drew my sword, resolving to sell my life dearly. Hardly had we
                     crossed blades when we both exclaimed in the same voice "Edward Wilks."
                     "Jonathan Williams."
                  
                  "Jonathan Williams," said I, lowering my sword, and holding out my hand, which
                     he shook warmly, "How came you here?"
                  "I am the captain of the pirate vessel," he replied.
                  "But why did you leave the smuggling business?" I asked.
                  "Why, all went wrong after you left us," he replied; "but, captain, what shall
                     we do with this schooner?"
                  "Blow her up—anything you wish," I replied.
                  "And will you join us?" he asked.
                  "Under what office?" I asked.
                  "As mate," he replied. "I was mate on board the Fire-fly—will you act as mate
                     on board of my vessel?"
                  I replied in the affirmative, and springing on board the vessel, I shook hands
                     with some few of the crew with whom I was acquainted. The schooner was then set
                     fire to, and we set sail in search of more prizes.
                  Years passed on. One day in an engagement with a frigate our vessel was
                     captured. Several of the crew, among them myself, managed to escape. Poor
                     Williams was shot, and the remaining pirates set at liberty. They soon joined
                     us. It was not long before we found another vessel, this one, and once more we
                     were sailing over the sea. Again our vessel was captured, again I escaped. My
                     name is a terror to all, from the sea of Azoff to Constantinople. Torinda, I
                     have finished my tale."
                  "Edward," said Torinda, "if you had a chance to win an honorable name would you
                     not accept if as a boon from Heaven?"
                  "Certainly," replied the rover; "but such a chance will never occur."
                  "It will," replied Torinda, "the chance is before you now."
                  "What mean you?"
                  "Join the army," replied Torinda. "You have a large crew—no doubt they would be
                     glad of such a chance to wipe away the stain upon their name. Were you to offer
                     yourself to Omer Pasha I have no doubt but that he would gladly receive
                     you."
                  "As a common soldier, yes," said the captain; "but, Torinda, I was not born to
                     obey, I was born to command."
                  "I too, was born to command," said Torinda. "No doubt the general will give you
                     a colonelship. He knows the daring of your men, and what a great acquisition
                     they will make to his army. Believe me, you have only to offer your services
                     and they will be accepted."
                  "But my schooner?"
                  "Do with her what you please," said Torinda. "If I were in your place I would
                     destroy her."
                  For a moment Wilks stood irresolute.
                  "I'll ask my men," said he suddenly, and by heavens! if they consent to it, I
                     will;" and he left the cabin.
                  In a few minutes three loud cheers announced to Torinda that the proposal was
                     accepted.
                  "I have done something to aid our cause," she said. "How delighted the general
                     will be when he finds that the pirates are to join him."
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE ARRIVAL—THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PIRATE
                     VESSEL—OLTENITZA—PREPARATIONS FOR THE BATTLE.
                  It was true. The pirates on hearing their captain's proposal accepted it at
                     once. In five minutes the black flag—so long the terror of the Black Sea—was
                     pulled down and thrown overboard, and the Turkish flag hoisted in its
                     place.
                  In six days the schooner reached Burgas. They remained here two days. On the
                     morning of the second day a boat pushed off from the shore towards the schooner
                     with a single man in it. On arriving near the schooner he hailed it and requested
                      that a rope might be thrown to him,
                     as he wished to come on board. In five minutes he was on board, and the crew
                     crowded about him.
                  "What do you want?" asked one of the sailors.
                  "I wish to see your captain," was the reply. "Where is he?"
                  "What do you want of him?" asked the other.
                  "What matters it to you, my man? I wish to see your captain. When I have seen
                     him I'll tell you my reasons for visiting the schooner," and he ground his
                     teeth as though not used to being contradicted.
                  "You'll find him in the cabin below," said one of the crew.
                  The man drew several gold pieces from his pocket and handed them to the man.
                     The fellow started back in astonishment.
                  "What is this for?" he asked.
                  "For answering my question," replied the stranger. "Tell your captain that I
                     wish to speak with him.
                  "With pleasure," replied the other. "Come with me and I'll show you the cabin,
                     sir" and he descended the steps followed by the stranger.
                  Torinda and the pirate were at breakfast, when the door was thrown open and the
                     sailor entered.
                  "Captain Wilks," said he, "here is a stranger that wishes to see you on some
                     very important business."
                  On hearing this, Torinda raised her head. On seeing the stranger's features her
                     face turned pale as death, and uttering a cry of alarm, she fell from the chair
                     to the floor.
                  "What is the matter?" cried the captain, springing from his seat and rushing
                     towards her.
                  "Take me in the other room—quick," she said, in a quick, hurried tone, yet so
                     low was it that the stranger heard her not. The captain obeyed, for he saw that
                     something unusual had happened. On reaching the other room, Torinda sprang from
                     his arms and closed the door.
                  "Edward," said she, in a voice that struggled with emotion, "know you who the
                     stranger is that is now in the other room?"
                  "No," replied Wilks, "neither do I care. If he is your enemy you need not fear
                     him, for I will protect you."
                  "He is not my enemy," said Torinda.
                  "Who then?"
                  "Bend your head—lower," said Torinda, and gazing fearfully around the room, she
                     added, in a quick, startling tone—"it is the—the Sultan."
                  "What!" cried the rover, in astonishment, "can this really be true?"
                  "Yes—but silence," said Torinda. "Do not recognize him unless he reveals
                     himself to you. Deal towards him as you would to any stranger. Think you that
                     he would recognize me in this dress?"
                  "No, I do not think he will," said Wilks; "but you had better change your sabre
                     for another."
                  "I will," said Torinda; and she did so. "You had better let me go out first,
                     for he will think it strange if we both return together."
                  Torinda opened the door and entered the other room. She Sultan was seated in a
                     chair. On seeing Torinda, he arose.
                  
                  "I wish to secure a passage in your vessel as far as the mouth of the Danube,"
                     said the Sultan. "I am willing to pay a good price—twenty thousand
                     sequins."
                  "I presume that you carry despatches to the army," said Wilks.
                  "You are right about the object of my journey," said the Sultan.
                  In a few minutes the sails were hoisted and they were sailing in a northern
                     direction towards the mouth of the Danube. In ten days they reached it.
                  Three days after they arrived at Oltenitza. It was with delight that Torinda
                     beheld the place where she was destined to play so important a part. To the
                     captain's great surprise, he learned that Omer Pasha was not with the army. He
                     therefore wrote to the commanding general, telling him who he was and that he
                     wished to join the army. The same day he received an answer which amply
                     satisfied both his men and himself. That night the pirate's vessel was
                     destroyed and the crew landed. The soldiers received them with joy. The
                     Sultan's surprise was very great when he learned that he had been traveling
                     with the renowned pirate. Little did he suspect that the captain knew who he
                     was and that his heart's idol was so near him.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  It is night. No moon shines in the sky, and there is not a star to be seen.
                     Nothing is heard excepting the heavy tread of the sentinels as they pace to and
                     fro in front of the tents. They must be watchful, for near them is an enemy
                     nearly three times their number. Suddenly one of the sentinels pricks up his
                     ears; he hears a noise, a noise as of many men coming towards him. He looks
                     carefully towards the river. He gazes but an instant—then comes the firing of a
                     musket—then the alarm of "The Russians! the Russians!"—then comes the loud
                     cries of men, the sudden blaze of torches—the call to arms—and the advancing
                     party encounters another—then comes the report of cannons, the clashing of
                     sabres, the loud shouts of the contending parties—another party from the
                     Russian camp comes up to aid their friends—these are defeated—soon the whole
                     army are there—and now the two armies are engaged together.
                  The moment the alarm was given, Torinda sprang up and drew her sabre. The
                     Sultan, who had not revealed his rank to any one, did the same. His example was
                     followed by the pirate chief. In obedience to his orders, the men formed
                     themselves into a large body and rushed from the tent. They were encountered by
                     a small but determined party of Russians, who, without a word, sprung upon
                     them. The conflict was long and well contested. Slowly, inch by inch, the
                     Russians moved backwards towards their camp. Suddenly another party came up,
                     and it was now the Turks' turn to retreat. Wilks, who had been attacking two or
                     three of the Russians at some distance, now came up. In an instant he saw that
                     the Turks were retreating and that a fierce and desperate charge alone could
                     save them. Waving his sword he shouted, as he sprang into the middle of the
                     contending parties, "Boarders, away!" In an instant every man felt that new
                     life was infused into him. With a loud cry the Turks threw themselves upon the 
                        Rusaians
                        Russians
                     , who, unable to withstand the impetuous charge, retreated. It was
                     then that Torinda appeared. In one hand she carried a small banner, in her
                     other a sabre dripping with blood. Placing herself at the head of the Turks,
                     she charged upon the retreating enemy. The Russians turned to defend
                     themselves, and gallantly did they maintain their reputation for courage.
                     Numbers fell, but the others, undismayed by the sight of their fallen
                     companions, fought on. They surrounded the Turks, and would soon have defeated
                     them if another party had not arrived. Soon the Russians retreated to their
                     encampment, and all, with the exception of the groans of the wounded, all was
                     silent once more.
                  At the hour of midnight, a man, dressed in a dark suit of clothes, left one of
                     the tents and with a rapid but noiseless step left the encampment. The thick
                     woods enabled him to reach the Russian camp unobserved. On reaching the central
                     part of the encampment, he paused and looked around him. Not hearing any one,
                     he advanced towards one of the tents over which the Russian flag was waving—a
                     sentinel stood at the entrance leaning against one of the posts. Drawing his
                     knife the man grasped him by the throat, and before he had time to speak, he
                     plunged his knife into his body. Without a groan the sentinel fell a corpse
                     upon the ground.
                  After listening a moment, the man grasped the canvas and pulling it towards him
                     peeped into the tent. No one was stirring. His quick eye caught the sight of
                     three or four men lying upon the ground. They were sleeping soundly. Drawing
                     his knife the man bent down on his knees and crept slowly towards the men. Soon
                     he reached them. Raising his knife he drew it across the throat of the man that
                     was nearest to him. He then listened attentively. Hearing no one, he crawled up
                     to the next and drew his knife across his throat. The remaining two shared the
                     same fate. With a quiet smile of satisfaction the man drew a large bag from his
                     pocket, and cutting off the heads of the men whom he had slain, he rolled them
                     into the bag. As he arose his eye fell on a small Russian flag with the name of
                     the Emperor of Russia on it. He tore the flag from the staff and flung it into
                     the bag. Then throwing his fearful load over his shoulder, he left the
                     tent.
                  In an hour he arrived at the Turkish encampment. Without speaking to any of the
                     sentinels he went directly to the tent in which the Sultan slept. Wilks was the
                     only one awake, and he was busily engaged in extracting a bullet which he had
                     received in the arm.
                  "Where is the Sultan?" he asked, as he gazed around the tent.
                  "Gone," was the reply. "He left for Constantinople five minutes since. But
                     where have you been?"
                  "To the Russian camp," was the reply. "When the sun rises to-morrow the
                     Russians will discover that their generals have been murdered."
                  "And who done it?" asked Wilks.
                  "I did," said Torinda—for it was indeed her—"I did. It was by my hand they
                     fell. Their heads are in this bag."
                  
                  "A daring, a noble deed," said Wilks.
                  The next morning the battle was resumed. Seven times the Turks retreated and
                     seven times did Torinda force them to return. The Russians were
                     beaten—thousands were slain, and many were taken prisoners.
                  Three months passed away. Torinda's daring deeds were on every tongue. The
                     Sultan heard of them and requested Omer Pasha to let him—for no one, with the
                     exception of Wilks and his crew, knew that she was a woman—visit
                     Constantinople.
                  "Young man," said Pasha, as he entered her tent, "the Sultan has sent for you.
                     This makes the third time that he has sent for you. You must visit him. I have
                     some important papers to send him, and you must be the bearer."
                  Two weeks later. It was a pleasant morning in February, that a large body of
                     men entered the city of Constantinople through the eastern gate. The streets
                     were crowded with people, and all of the houses were decked with flags,
                     banners, &c. As the soldiers approached loud cheers rent the air. The
                     object of all this attention was seated in the centre of the troops on a high
                     throne drawn by two white oxen. It was Torinda. As they drew near the palace
                     the gates were opened and they passed into the garden. The Sultan was seated on
                     a high throne near the gate. Around him were all the foreign consuls and his
                     officers in their robes of state. As the car approached the Sultan stepped from
                     his throne and extended his hand. On seeing her features, however, he started
                     back.
                  "Young man," said he "I have seen you before, but where I know not."
                  "It was on board the pirate vessel," said Torinda.
                  "Ah, so it was. I recollect you perfectly," said the Sultan.
                  "My lord." said Torinda, struggling to restrain her emotion, "I bring you
                     important despatches from the army," and drawing a large packet from her belt,
                     she handed it to him.
                  "Mesrour, take this," said the Sultan; "and now, young man, we are about to
                     reward you. Whatever you wish for is yours. To day, you are the Sultan, and I
                     am your slave. Name your wish; what is there belonging to me that you wish
                     for?"
                  "The 
                        minature
                        miniature
                      which hangs around your neck is all I ask," said Torinda, her voice
                     struggling with emotion.
                  "That," cried the Sultan, starting back, "that contains the portrait of one
                     most dear to me,"
                  "And may I be so bold as to ask whose portrait it is?"
                  "Yes," said the Sultan, sinking back into a chair; "it is the portrait of—of
                     Torinda."
                  At this moment the oxen started forward and Torinda's cap fell to the ground.
                     Her curls, which she had merely placed in her cap, fell around her beautiful
                     neck in luxurious profusion.
                  "It is Torinda!" cried the Sultan, staggering back.
                  "My lord," cried Torinda, and unable to restrain herself, she sprang upon the
                     platform and clasped the Sultan in her arms.
                  "Allah! I thank thee," cried the Sultan, as the tears of joy rolled down his
                     cheeks.
                  "My lord," said Torinda, timidly, "will you forgive me for leaving you?"
                  "Forgive you!" cried the Sultan. "Yes, the joy of this meeting amply repays me
                     for all that I have suffered."
                  "Come," said Torinda, "I have much to tell you. Let us retire into the
                     palace."
                  That evening the city was brilliantly illuminated, and a solemn thanksgiving to
                     Allah was made in the Mosque St. Sophia. All the inhabitants that could gain
                     admittance in the mosque, attended, and great was their joy when they beheld
                     the Sultan and his beauteous bride.

               THE LIFE AND CONFESSIONS OF DON HERNANDEZ ROMEZ DE ARAGO.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  DON MIGUEL.
                  The calm twilight of a summer's evening shrouded the city of Madrid; the work
                     of the day was over, and no sound was heard save the hum of voices and the
                     occasional laugh of some gay cavalier enjoying the promenade in the soft air,
                     puffing his cigaritto, and glancing at the fair forms on the balconies above
                     his head. Among these idling gentlemen none were more remarked, and none
                     received more approving glances from the bright eyes gazing down upon them,
                     than two young men who sauntered languidly down the street, dressed in the
                     richest style of the fashion of that period. They wore the gay velvet doublet,
                     slashed with gold, with puffs of white satin along the sleeves, the brilliant
                     embroidered waistcoat or jacket—fitting tight to the form—and the velvet
                     breeches, reaching to the knee, terminating in a garter of velvet, embroidered
                     curiously in gold. These rich and gorgeous costumes were completed by the
                     broad, low-crowned beaver, the rim fastened up on the left side of the head,
                     and a large plume drooping gracefully over the right shoulder. On their feet
                     they wore white morocco boots, the wide tops of which reached half way up to
                     the knee, disclosing silk stockings fitting neatly, which disappeared in the
                     lace that hung over the top of the boot.
                  The faces of these young men were entirely unlike, both in feature and
                     expression. The one was of a dark and swarthy complexion, with bright black
                     eyes, that revealed every sentiment, whether of joy or anger, that passed over
                     his heart. His long raven hair was
                     carefully curled, and hung in ringlets beneath his hat, swept by the bright red
                     plume that trembled and waved from side to side as the steps of its wearer
                     passed over the uneven pavement. His nose was straight and finely formed; his
                     mouth small, the upper lip concealed by a silky moustache as dark as the hair
                     that clustered over his forehead and temples. When he smiled, which he did from
                     time to time, he revealed between the half-parted lips, teeth white and
                     regular, though large and compactly set. His frame was strongly knit, his arms
                     large and muscular, and between the knee and the boot could be seen a finely
                     formed leg, which gave evidence of its abundance of muscle at every step he
                     took. He was above the medium size, and might have been called strikingly
                     handsome but for the expression of his face, which denoted a sensual and cruel
                     heart.
                  His companion was the opposite style of person. His hair was much lighter than
                     that of the one first described. His complexion was not of the same swarthy
                     hue, and his face was full of gentleness and kindness. Its winning expression,
                     aided by the glance of his soft blue eyes, had won for Don Miguel de Cazastro
                     more favors from the beauties of Madrid, than all the manliness and stern
                     beauty of his companion had secured for him, if the report spoke true that was
                     echoed around among the gallants of that superb city. He wore no beard on any
                     portion of his face except the slight moustache, which, though light and soft
                     as silk, contributed not a little to his good looks. His dress was of the same
                     fashion as the other's, only differing in colors—where the first wore red, the
                     costume of the latter was blue.
                  "Miguel," exclaimed the dark-haired cavalier, "the durance and the nature of
                     our friendship both determine me to apply to thee for the assistance that I
                     must procure for to-morrow morning."
                  "And what calls thee, then, friend Pedro; is it another affair with some
                     unreasonable brother or clamorous husband, who will not be quiet till he has
                     assuaged the loss of his honor by the loss of a little blood, or is it an
                     affair of play? Good faith, it cannot be a love affair, for they choose the
                     night time, and shun the broad noonday, which, indeed, is sadly trying to the
                     eyes!"
                  "A truce to thy joking, Miguel, it is neither a duello with a husband nor a brother, nor is it a love affair. In
                     short, it is—"
                  "It is—what?—for the Blessed Virgin's sake why keep me in this suspense!"
                  "Thou wilt swear thyself to secresy?"
                  "My hand on it!"
                  "Agreed. It is, friend Miguel, neither more nor less than an abduction."
                  "An abduction, Diavolo! and who is the fair subject of thy scheming?"
                  "It is not a fair subject!" answered Don Pedro.
                  "Ah!" continued Don Miguel, "she is old, then, and wrinkled, perhaps."
                  "Neither old nor wrinkled," carelessly continued Don Pedro, wilfully provoking
                     his companion's curiosity.
                  "Who in the d—l's name is she, then?"
                  "It is not a she, my dear Miguel—but look at those beautiful eyes
                     gazing down upon us!"
                  "The fiend take her eyes! "Wilt thou prolong my impatience still further? Who
                     is it that my assistance is necessary to carry away, I tell thee? I am dying to
                     know!"
                  "What a face and what eyes, by Cupid! 'Tis like gazing into the sky reflected
                     in the light of stars, for 'tis full as soft, and a thousand times as
                     beautiful!"
                  "May the fiend fly away with thy faces, and eyes, and stars, and thy love-sick
                     nonsense! Wilt tell me who thou art to carry off?"
                  "Aye, if thy curiosity is such that I can satisfy it by all that I know myself.
                     To be speedy, then, it is a man."
                  "Ah, an old man with a sweet daughter, I suppose, and the daughter will pay the
                     father's ransom!"
                  "There thou'rt wrong, good Miguel, for 'tis a young man, with no daughter in
                     the question; but his attentions to a certain donna Julia, that I wot of, are
                     of too serious a character to be allowed to proceed any further."
                  Don Miguel started, turned slightly pale, and inquired in a careless way—
                  "And will he be alone, Pedro?"
                  "By my faith, I hope so. Dost thou suppose, Sir Miguel Cazastro—thou a gallant
                     and a knight—dost suppose a youth requires company in his ladies' bower? How
                     should he be, if not alone?"
                  "Then I will none of it!" returned the other. "If thou canst not settle thy
                     affairs with a single man—thou a gallant and a
                     knight—(emphasizing the words) breast to breast, and blade to
                     blade, then I'll not play the part of the hired bravo, nor set upon a poor
                     youth two to one!"
                  "Hard terms thou makest use of, friend Miguel. Bravo is not an epithet for the
                     ears of a noble of Spain."
                  "I withdraw my words to no one."
                  "And yet methinks were I to forget how long we had been friends, I could easily
                     make thee."
                  "Aye, with thy band at thy back"——
                  
                  "My band!" echoed Don Pedro, starting from his companion's side, "what meanest
                     thou, Miguel, by my band?"
                  "Thy surprise is very well, and would do honor to a play-actor, but it dupes
                     not me."
                  "Hark ye, Sir Miguel, it is ill jesting on such subjects, and I pray thee dally
                     no longer with my patience——"
                  "It is my turn now, fair Sir Pedro," answered the light-hearted Miguel,
                     laughing at his companion's impatience; "it is my turn now. Then thou shalt
                     tell me the name of this young man thou proposest to carry away."
                  "Faith, I know it not," answered Pedro; "all that I know is, that he has been
                     seen to go there, and that he is of goodly mien; and that the fair Julia favors
                     him is enough for me to know to hate him."
                  "And now, my honest friend Pedro, I think, from various observations that I
                     have made, that the chieftain called Bernado, the Bandit, and my friend Pedro,
                     are one and the same person. Hist! no words, my gentle friend, and keep thy
                     hand from thy sword-hilt. I have but to cry aloud to the citizens passing in
                     this street, and they will not fail to earn the reward offered for thy
                     head!"
                  Don Miguel turned his eyes to the other side of the way, and when he again
                     turned towards his companion he found that he had disappeared.
                  "And now for the villa!" he muttered, as he turned down a street that led to
                     one of the gates of the city, and was soon out of sight.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE SERENADE.
                  In the midst of a richly cultivated garden stood a pavillion, built in the
                     gothic style of architecture, surrounded by flowers and shrubs on every side,
                     and shaded by the protecting branches of the large trees that waved over its
                     gabled roof. The care with which everything was arranged, the neatness of the
                     gravel walks, and the precise trimming of the hedges, all betokened the nature
                     of the spot. In fact, it was fitted up as the boudoir of one of the most
                     beautiful and haughty women of Madrid,
                      where she passed her leisure hours.
                     Often in the stillness of the summer evening a soft, sweet voice rose on the
                     air, to the accompaniment of the tinkling guitar, dying away in the silence,
                     waking the echoes of the little garden as it floated along o'er the heads of
                     the listening flowers. Once, when the song was finished, and the fair singer
                     had laid her guitar at her feet, a fine manly voice startled her from her
                     reclining position, and she listened attentively to catch the words. The voice
                     sounded near, and she judged that the singer must be concealed in the thicket
                     behind her pavillion.
                  The serenade was set to music of the most tender expression; the words might be
                     translated as follows: 
                        
                           "Oh, heart! that no pleadings can move,
                           I'd give up my hope of the skies
                           For but one word from thy lips, love,
                           Or but a glance from thine eyes!
                        
                        
                           Oh, would of the world I were king,
                           Surrounded by beauty and pride,
                           My all at thy feet I would fling,
                           And pray—be my queen—be my bride!
                        
                        
                           Ah, soft is the light of thine eye,
                           And maddening the touch of thy hand;
                           Thy face is as fair as the sky,
                           When summer shines over the land."
                        
                     
                  
                  The singer had proceeded thus far in his serenade when he perceived with
                     delight a small white hand protruding through the lattice window, which was
                     open only wide enough to give egress to the taper fingers and small wrist of
                     the fair Julia, for she was the beautiful goddess to whom this grove and
                     pavillion were consecrated.
                  The young man seized the hand and covered it with kisses, when it was withdrawn
                     and the lattice closed over it. The young man was our acquaintance, Don Miguel
                     de Cazastro, and this was the beginning of his passion for Julia. Every evening
                     found him near the pavillion, and it was himself that had been discovered by
                     the spies of Don Pedro, who had asked his aid in removing the unknown suitor
                     from his path.
                  Every evening, at the setting of the sun, the young and hand-some Don Miguel
                     found himself near the pavillion, and at last his constancy was rewarded; the
                     fair Julia, touched at his perseverance and patience, one evening sent out her
                     maid to invite him to come in and partake of a cup of some refreshment after
                     his ride, an offer which the young cavalier gladly availed himself of to become
                     acquainted personally with his beloved. He entered the little pavillion, and
                     was struck by the beauty of everything around him; the elegance and beauty of
                     the various tables and pieces of furniture, the taste displayed in the
                     selection of the pictures that adorned the walls, and by the loveliness and
                     grace of the lady who seemed born to grace such a terrestrial paradise. Don
                     Miguel partook of the fruit that was placed before him; never had he tasted
                     such superb grapes as clustered on the vines of this lovely garden. He drank of
                     the wine, and never had he quaffed such nectar before.
                  It is easy, when we are in love, to make a feast of a very simple repast,
                     provided it is shared with the object of our heart's affections, and thus with
                     the youthful and ardent Don Miguel; he drank in the smile of his mistress with
                     the ruby wine, and the one added to the effect of the other. Before he had
                     spent an hour in her society the young man was madly in love. He hesitated not
                     to avow his passion, and poured forth the burning avowal with all the
                     earnestness of his impassioned soul.
                  "And tell me, lady, I beseech thee," he concluded, "if in thy heart thou canst
                     find one grain of hope for me; give me but the smallest foundation for hope and
                     I leave thee not only satisfied, but delirious with joy. Speak, lady, speak,
                     and decide my fate, for death is preferable to life without thee—the one is
                     sudden and a sure remedy for my woes, and the other is a long and dreary road,
                     leading to the tomb, it is true, but fraught with misery on the way. Lady, I
                     would sooner die a thousand deaths rather than journey the dreary road of life
                     without thee."
                  And, dear reader, we must infer that he read in the tender eyes of his beloved
                     those gentle hopes for which he prayed, and that he saw in the loving smiles
                     that played on those rosy lips a language more eloquent than mere words, a
                     language which spoke to him of love returned, a language that whispered to him
                     in tones low, but thrilling as the throbbing of his own breast, welcoming him
                     to the citadel of her heart.
                  And that heart, that gentle, fluttering heart, was beating against his own, his
                     arms enfolded her in a close embrace, and their lips met, in the first,
                     long-lingering kiss of love.
                  How shall we describe what so many older veterans of the pen have failed to do?
                     How shall we describe the tender whisperings, the meeting hands, whose touches
                     thrill to the soul; the low-murmured words that are breathed softly on the
                     night air; the vows of constancy and ideal happiness floating through the dim
                     vista of the future? Alas! how often do we find that those whisperings are not
                     the breath of the true passion, but the promptings of the Evil one to the
                     innocent and pure. Those low-murmured words, how often the language of deceit;
                     those vows of constancy, how often made but to be ruthlessly broken; and those
                     visions of ideal happiness, perhaps false as the heart that prompts them, how often are they trampled
                     upon sternly and pitilessly until the poor fluttering heart lies torn and
                     bleeding in the icy coldness of the grave. No pitying hand will deck with the
                     flowers of sympathy the marble above her head, and none will be found so
                     careless of the world's opinion who will say an extenuating or a
                     sympathizing word for the lost victim of man's perfidy and deceit.
                  But in the case of Don Miguel and the lady Julia, sincerity and passion
                     prompted the words that sprang from their lips, fresh from the limpid fountains
                     of their pure hearts.
                  We draw a veil over that lover's first meeting, for we feel that we never could
                     do justice to the fervor of that interminable embrace at parting—that last kiss
                     and that "Adieu!" breathed from two young beings on the soft night air.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  THE LADY JULIA.
                  The lady Julia was seated on a softly cushioned divan, placed by the open
                     window, the light breezes playing around her fair face, and tossing the auburn
                     tresses, from time to time, over her white brow. Whether it was entirely for
                     the sake of the evening breeze, that came laden with the perfumed breath of the
                     flowers, which it kissed as it passed over their blooming heads, or whether she
                     was watching the silver fountain leaping up, its snowy spray sparkling in the
                     rays of the setting sun, or indeed what her real motive for choosing this
                     situation was we cannot inform the reader, but we shrewdly suspect that it was
                     not the fountain that attracted her gaze, nor the flowers that occupied her
                     attention.
                  She was looking up to the brow of the hill, behind which the golden sun was
                     sinking in all his splendor; her eyes were fixed upon the winding road that led
                     to the villa, and to the little village a few miles beyond. Expressions of
                     disappointment flitted across her face, when a horseman appeared over the brow
                     of the hill and passed quietly into the valley. The evening grew darker and
                     darker, but still Julia kept her position by the window, and at last her
                     patience seemed to be rewarded, for she started up from her reclining position,
                     and exclaimed, her dark eyes lighting up with pleasure and a joyful smile
                     playing around her mouth, "It is he! it is he! I knew he could not disappoint a
                     heart so true to him as mine!" And looking up to the hill she saw a horseman
                     galloping swiftly along, mid a cloud of dust which followed the hoofs of his
                     horse. She saw the blue cloak and scarf, and the rose-colored plume that danced
                     over his head. Nearer and nearer came the cavalier, until he was lost to her
                     gaze in the windings of the road as it hid itself in the valley. But a few
                     seconds elapsed and Julia was in vain trying to calm the beatings of her heart.
                     Her quick ear caught the sound of a footstep on the floor, and in another
                     moment she was clasped in her lover's arms. Don Miguel imprinted a kiss on her
                     sweet, small mouth, and her non-resistance was the welcome she gave him.
                  "My sweet love!" he exclaimed rapturously, as he seated himself on a cushion at
                     her feet, "how fares it with thee?—art thou not dull?—dost thou not feel the
                     want of a companion to thy loneliness?"
                  "I am never lonely, dear Miguel," answered she, smiling, "when I have thine
                     image before me, as it ever is; and how can I want any other companion but my
                     own thoughts when they are continually whispering to me of thee?"
                  The young man fondly pressed the hand which he held in his. After a moment of
                     reflection he turned his eyes on the face of his beloved, and said, in a low,
                     quiet tone—
                  "My own dear Julia, it is sad to be bearer of bad news, but I feel that I ought
                     to confide to thee what has come to my knowledge quite unexpectedly I assure
                     thee. This very evening, as I was walking in the public street with a man I
                     have known for a long time, an old schoolmate and companion of my earliest
                     boyhood, he confessed to me his passion for—for whom think you, my dearest?
                     Nay, you will never guess it, for it is none other than thine own sweet
                     self!"
                  "And yet, dear Miguel, I know not that I ever had speech with this friend of
                     thine," murmured the lady, pausing in deep thought.
                  "I am well aware, my sweet Julia, that there never has a word passed between
                     you, and therefore that he ne'er has dared to press his insolent suit."
                  "I know no suitor but thee, dear Miguel, and if Heaven will only vouchsafe thee
                     to me, I will pray for no other."
                  "My dearest and best," exclaimed the young man, kissing her hand as she spoke,
                     "thy prattle is so sweet to me that in hearing thee speak I forget all else; I
                     forget the world, all, and think of nothing but my own overwhelming happiness,
                     and my most ardent love for thee. But I should warn thee, dear Julia, against the machinations of this Don
                     Pedro, for he has threatened to remove thy lover from his path, and a man who
                     will carry away a fellow-being in the full blaze of noonday will not scruple to
                     treat thee in the same manner; and once in his clutches, my dearest, I shudder
                     to think what might befall thee!"
                  "Fear nothing, my own," answered Julia, as she stole her arm soothingly around
                     his neck, "thy Julia will ever be true to thee both body and soul. Seest thou
                     this, Miguel, 'Death before dishonor!'" and Miguel beheld in the
                     left hand of his mistress a small, keen and exquisitely worked dagger or
                     stiletto, which is so generally worn by Spaniards of both sexes. Don Miguel
                     shuddered as the fearful thought crept over him, that flashing blade might once
                     be buried in that soft and snowy bosom.
                  No more beautiful group for the painter's hand was ever offered to the eye. The
                     young and beautiful lady Julia leaned over from the sofa on which she sat, her
                     right arm, round and white, was thrown around the neck of Don Miguel, who sat
                     on the cushion at her feet. In her left hand she held the polished steel, and
                     on it his gaze was riveted. Her large black eyes flashed with the excitement
                     and the stern determination of her noble purpose, while his eyes gazed with an
                     involuntary expression of horror at so deadly a weapon clasped in so beauteous
                     a hand.
                  "God grant, my beloved, that nothing may happen to thee that may render
                     necessary even the thought of death, but I rejoice to see that
                     thou art prepared——"
                  "Aye, Miguel, I am prepared for a life of happiness and joy with thee, or I am
                     prepared for death away from thee. I sometimes think, my own, that whate'er may
                     be our fate in this world, that we will both meet again in the next, and when
                     that meeting shall come who will ever separate us again? Let us hope, my own,
                     let us hope!"
                  "Julia, we are sad this evening; thou art not as gay as usual; and I, too, am
                     sad. Sing to me, Julia, for thy voice is a cure for all my griefs."
                  "But why should we be sad, Miguel, who could harm me, surrounded as I am by
                     servants and dependents of the family? I have but to cry aloud, and one shriek
                     will call to my aid a hundred men; and yet, as thou sayest, I am sad, but 'tis
                     not a melancholy sadness, Miguel, since I can share it with thee."
                  Julia took up the guitar which stood near, and running her taper fingers over
                     the strings, her voice murmured rather than sang the following verses:
                        
                           "The air is full of gladness,
                           Bright clouds are in the sky,
                           Yet my soul is tinged with sadness,
                           Altho' I know not why.
                        
                        
                           'Tis not of grief or sorrow,
                           'Tis not of care or pain,
                           For it whispers that the morrow
                           Will bring my love again!
                        
                        
                           Ever they at the evening hour,
                           When the sun sets o'er the lea,
                           Come, love, to thy lady's bower!
                           She ever waits for thee.
                        
                     
                  
                  And here the manly voice of Don Miguel arose to the same air that his mistress
                     had sung. 
                        
                           And when the day is over,
                           And vanished on pinions fleet,
                           Thou shalt welcome thine absent lover,
                           As he lovingly kneels at thy feet."
                        
                     
                  
                  And thus in music and avowals of mutual affection the hours flew away, until
                     Don Miguel reluctantly bid his last farewell to his beloved, and tearing
                     himself away was soon flying on his way to Madrid. The sound of his horse's
                     hoofs had scarcely died away in the distance when the figure of a man emerged
                     from the thicket surrounding the pavilion, and crossing the garden was lost to
                     sight. He pursued his way into the valley, and when he found himself under the
                     shade of a large tree, isolated from the rest, he blew a blast on his horn that
                     hung around his neck. Almost immediately a cavalier galloped up to the
                     spot.
                  "Aye, aye! Juan, I have seen him with mine own eyes, and have marked him. We
                     shall see if this stripling shall cross the path of GUY ROMEZ with impunity!
                     Follow on foot. I shall now hie me to the cave, Juan, where thou shalt find me.
                     Adieu!"
                  So saying he set spurs to his noble horse, regained the high road, and was soon
                     on his way to the mountains.
                  Meanwhile, as Don or Guy Romez, for he it was, was spurring to
                     his mountain retreat, the lady Julia left the pavilion and regained the house
                     at the other end of the garden. Soon the light, that gleamed like a star from
                     her window, disappeared, and Julia was again with her absent lover in her
                     rosy-colored dreams.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  GUY ROMEZ.
                  "Ha! ha! ha! my good Sebastian, what a boon companion art thou! By the holy
                     rood! I have not laughed so heartily since the provost was going to hang me for
                     theft. I quaff this goblet to thy health, and mayest thou live long to cheer us
                     with thy ready wit."
                  These words, interrupted by laughter from time to time, were uttered by a large
                     and swarthy man, considerably past the prime of life, yet bearing great signs
                     of vigor and strength. His face, nearly hidden in his huge black beard, was
                     sinister and forbidding, though when he laughed as heartily as he was doing at
                     the time of his introduction to the reader, the expression was not at all
                     visible. His eyes were small, of a gray color, and set deep in their sockets,
                     which, taken together with his large nose and wide mouth, displaying a huge set
                     of wolfish looking teeth, and his abundant black beard, combined to render him
                     not in the least a pleasing looking object.
                  The company, consisting of from twenty to twenty-five persons, were seated
                     round a large oaken table, on which were the remains of a plentiful supper.
                     Flasks of wine, emptied of their contents, laid around the table, and others
                     that yet appeared to retain some of the precious fluid were standing near the
                     large cups and goblets of the men. They were men of all countries and climates
                     mingled together, banded in the brotherhood of crime, to escape the penalties
                     of the laws which they had outraged. The patricide, the murderer, the midnight
                     burglar, the ferocious slave-dealer, together with thieves and other
                     malefactors, here found a refuge, provided their courage and hardihood were
                     well tried and proven. They took an oath on entering the band to observe the
                     laws which bound them together, (for every community must have certain rules
                     and regulations to guide them,) and to preserve implicit obedience to their
                     commander, or leader, who was styled by his followers "GUY ROMEZ," to which was
                     sometimes added "THE GUERILLA!"
                  The apartment in which they were carousing was apparently hollowed out of the
                     solid rock, but it was one of those caves which abound in the mountainous
                     regions of Spain. It was lighted by torches, held by fixtures in the wall,
                     which threw a lurid glare over the scarred and savage faces of the robbers, as
                     they sat at their midnight feast, quaffing deep draughts of the intoxicating
                     cup, and laughing aloud in their conscious security. Security, say we, for at
                     every pause in the noise and confusion might be heard the measured tread of the
                     sentinel marching silently to and fro on his post above their heads.
                  "Ay! ay! my men, drink while we can and drive dull care away, for which of us
                     knows what awaits him on the morrow? A song! good Sebastian, 'twill enliven us.
                     Silence, down there, you roisters, silence for the song of Sebastian?"
                  And while the ribald jest and the coarse song echoed loud under the vaulted
                     roof, and the revelry and confusion was at its height, a mailed step was heard
                     without, the rude door was flung open, and a young man stepped proudly into the
                     apartment. At his presence every noise was hushed, every laugh was silent, and
                     the song of the drunken Sebastian stuck in his throat. The man whose presence
                     acted thus powerfully on those men so hardened by crime that no earthly
                     presence could seem to affect them, was attired in a scarlet riding coat, bound
                     in gold, a black plume bent proudly o'er his head, and the spurs on his heavy
                     riding-boots clanked as he strode, erect and haughty, to the head of the
                     table.
                  A grim silence reigned supreme where but a moment since all was uproar and
                     confusion. The intruder gazed around him with a piercing and scrutinizing look,
                     a ray of fire seemed to flash from his eye when he encountered anything that
                     displeased or any gaze that opposed. Beneath the fire of that flashing eye the
                     stoutest heart quailed and the boldest gaze fell abashed. He gazed around him
                     on the scene of debauchery and feasting, and a scornful smile curled his proud,
                     determined lip.
                  "Men!" he exclaimed, and the silence became, if possible, more oppressive than
                     before, "I require ten of you, the boldest and most expert riders in my band,
                     together with ten of the best steeds our stables can afford. See that they be
                     properly equipped, and that there remains no girth to tighten or no impediment,
                     for every foot shall be in the stirrup at sunrise. You have still two hours for
                     sleep, and now away—and look you that my orders be attended to!"
                  Without waiting any longer he ordered his lieutenant to pick the men, and
                     attend to the execution of his orders, upon which he withdrew, and the heavy
                     door closed once more behind him as his armed heel strode firmly through a long
                     corridor in the rock which led to some other division of the cave.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  NINA.
                  Passing hastily along through a vaulted hall, lighted by torches fixed in the
                     wall, Guy Romez entered a large circular apartment, which served for the
                     guard-room. Here men were lounging, awaiting their turn to watch; some were
                     sleeping soundly on the benches, others were playing with dice, and others were
                     standing in groups, passing the time in gossiping and conversation. Guy passed
                     on, unheeding all there save to acknowledge by a motion the salute addressed to
                     him by his men, and passing through another corridor, he applied a key to a
                     massive door at the extreme end, and swinging it on its creaking hinges, he
                     entered, closed it carefully after him, and opening another smaller door, he
                     stood in a small, exquisitely furnished room. A silver lamp was suspended from
                     the ceiling; a thick carpet prevented his footsteps being heard. On an ample
                     couch, o'ershadowed by curtains of damask and crimson silk, lay the form of a
                     young and beautiful girl. Her beautifully moulded arm was thrown negligently
                     over her head, as white as the pillow on which it rested. Soft brown eyelids
                     threw a shade over the upper part of her face, and her parted lips showed her
                     teeth regular and white, as the snow in the rays of the sun. A straight Grecian
                     nose and a small dimpled chin completed the beauty of her features; thick
                     tresses of curling auburn hair clustered around her temples and bathed the
                     pillow which supported her head. Her well developed breast heaved gently in the
                     unconscious slumber in which she lay. The bandit paused for a moment to gaze on
                     this form, so light, so graceful, and glowing with youth and beauty. The blue
                     veins were distinctly visible through the white polished skin that covered her
                     symmetrical arms, and in those azure veins the life-stream of youth was leaping
                     impetuously along, as you have seen some rivulet in the grim old woods, flowing
                     rapidly over here a pebble, and there another impediment, but overcoming them
                     all from the mere velocity of its course. The clouded brow of the chieftain
                     relaxed its frown which had gathered there, and its stern severity faded away,
                     leaving a smile in its place, as the sun, emerging from the black storm-cloud,
                     brightens up with its heavenly light the face of nature, which was dark and
                     scowling but a moment before. Guy Romez advanced softly to the
                        HOLTON & JARDINE N.Y.
                     
                      side of the couch, the fierceness of
                     the lion had melted into the gentleness of the lamb, and touching his lips to
                     the brow of the sleeper, she awoke with a slight start.
                  "My Nina sleeps," said he in gentle tones, so unlike those in which he had
                     addressed the band of revelers, that it sounded not like the same voice.
                  "My Nina sleeps."
                  "Nina sleeps," answered the girl, turning her large brown eyes full upon him,
                     the red blood mantling in her cheek as she spoke. "Nina sleeps, for she is
                     weary with watching for the return of her chief, and weary with sighing that he
                     comes not. But her sighs are not heard by the absent one, and they cannot bring
                     him back to her arms!"
                  "Nay, nay, my gentle Nina, thy sighs have proved all-powerful, for behold me
                     here at thy side. I come to tell thee, Nina, my beautiful, that our prospects
                     are growing brighter, for this night I shall take two prisoners whose ransom
                     will be a fortune in gold to us. Then, sweet heart, you and I will away from
                     this mountain retreat, and with our wealth we will seek thine own fair land—the
                     land of sunny France—and there, amid her blooming fields and vine-clad hills,
                     we'll pass our lives away together and alone. Thou shalt have diamonds, and
                     jewels, and satins, and lace, and all that thy heart can desire, and the queen
                     in her palace shall not be as happy as thou!"
                  The poor girl had raised herself on her arm during these bright words of the
                     fair-spoken Guy, and the happiness of the future thus pictured to her
                     imagination lit up her oval countenance with the glow of hope; her eyes flashed
                     proudly, and she listened, with parted lips and head thrown back, to the
                     enthusiastic promises of the crafty chief. In that one moment of credulity she
                     forgot all the promises that had been made and broken, all the vows that had
                     been trampled upon; all the past faded away from her sight, and she gazed on
                     the bright picture of the future painted by the fairy-like pencil of Hope. She
                     forgot the man, in the happy promises he made; she forgot his perjury, his
                     desertion, and her own heartless betrayal. For the ruthless Guy Romez had taken
                     advantage of her helpless condition to ruin her forever. Nina was but half a
                     woman; beautiful as she was physically, yet she was but half-formed mentally.
                     She was half-witted. Gentle and harmless, she wandered to and fro, and no one
                     would dream of harming so helpless and so unfortunate a being. But the
                     helplessness which even the savage Indian on the endless prairies of the West,
                     and the untutored Turk, and the Arab on his native sands respect and protect,
                     was no safeguard against the fiend-like designs of Guy Romez.
                  The wild snatches of song echoed over the mountain tops, as the unfortunate
                     young girl wandered beneath the shade of the lofty pines, gathering the wild
                     flowers and wreathing them in her flowing hair, to welcome the return of the
                     chieftain. But often he came not, and Nina was forced by very weariness to
                     return to her couch, after nights of watching for him, 
                        
                           "Whose bride shall await,
                           Like a love-lighted watch-fire all night at the gate."
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE DEPARTURE OF THE ROBBERS.
                  The gray light of the morning had scarcely tinged the rugged rocks with its
                     leaden light, before Guy Romez, leading by the bridle a large and powerfully
                     built black steed, which was to bear him amid the perils of the day, issued
                     forth from an aperture in the rock, which closed up almost as soon as he had
                     emerged in safety from its shade. He traversed the little pathway leading round
                     the top of the rock, and soon stood in a circular meadow, around which the tops
                     of the mountains rose on all sides, concealing the field from the view beyond.
                     This had once evidently formed the basin of some little lake on the mountain,
                     but the water had long ago dried up and disappeared, leaving about an acre of
                     ground, in the form of an amphitheater, with a level gravel bottom, in some
                     places showing signs of stunted shrubs and dwarfish grass. Into this arena
                     walked the robber-chief, still leading his gallant steed; he was the first man
                     on the ground; he sat down on a large round stone, and was soon lost in silent
                     meditation. His horse began to nibble the few blades of grass that sprung up
                     around the rock, from which pleasant occupation he suddenly desisted, for he
                     threw up his head with a jerk that nearly tore the bridle from his pensive
                     master's hand; his spread nostrils snuffing the wind, his listening ears erect,
                     he stood as if awaiting some impending danger. Guy, however, scarcely noticed
                     his horse's fear, for he stood silently awaiting the arrival of the cause of
                     the noise and clattering in the distance. He had not long to wait, for with a
                     wild cheer, a horseman dashed round the point of the rock, and galloped swiftly
                     up to where the robber stood unmoved. The sight of a horse and rider bearing
                     down at full speed upon a man would,
                     very probably, cause him to get out of the way, but the impassible Guy moved
                     neither to the right nor to the left, and the rider continued his furious pace
                     until within a few yards of where he stood, when he swerved gracefully and
                     rapidly as an arrow that is turned from its course, and passing around, he at
                     length stood still at the right hand of the robber chief, who bestowed on him a
                     glance of approval. The rider who merited this encomium upon his horsemanship
                     was a tall and slender youth, over whose head the dews of twenty summers had
                     not yet fallen; his handsome face, and large, moist eyes, sparkling with the
                     praise of his chief, his curling locks, all combined with his picturesque
                     costume, rendered him strikingly beautiful to the eye of the beholder. He wore
                     the common felt hat, or sombrero, of Spain, a velvet jacket, covered with
                     buttons and ornaments, his vest of fancy colors disappearing in the wide, red
                     sash, and his high horseman's boots, with his jingling spurs, proclaimed him a
                     young guerilla, had not the brace of pistols in his belt, and the sword at his
                     side, unmistakably attested the fact.
                  He lifted his sombrero proudly in the air and saluted, with a perfect grace and
                     ease, his chieftain, who still stood gazing at him.
                  "Well done, Alfonso! thou art ever the first on the field when thy chieftain
                     calls—and the others of my band, why tarry they behind?"
                  "My lord," answered Alfonso, respectfully, "so please you, we are before the
                     time; it lacks yet some minutes to the rising of the sun," and pointed with his
                     hand to the crest of a neighboring mountain, behind which the approaching
                     luminary was lighting up the eastern heaven with his soft and golden rays. Guy
                     Romez looked in the direction indicated by his young lieutenant, for such was
                     the youthful Alfonso, and gazed with admiration on the beautiful scene.
                  "Alfonso, look at the rising sun! Mayhap 'tis the last sun that may rise on thy
                     vision. I have prophetic forebodings of ill-fortune, which have clouded my
                     waking senses and blotted sleep from out my earthly luxuries. This night I
                     closed my eyes, I slept, 'twas but for a moment; methought I stood upon the
                     rock o'erhanging that black abyss where men e'er this have found a tomb and
                     none have been the wiser! Suddenly as I gazed into its fearful depths, I felt
                     the moss on which I trod slipping gradually beneath my feet. The cold sweat
                     stood out in huge, great drops upon my throbbing forehead, my brain reeled, I
                     held my breath for very horror! Yet still I kept on in my slippery pace, I
                     reached the brink; my ashy lips could not breathe the fleeting prayer that
                     rushed to them for utterance; I reached the brink; I saw the dark, yawning
                     chasm, and I felt myself precipitated, living, into my tomb! The
                     frightful feeling of falling! falling! falling! awoke me to consciousness; and
                     look ye, Alfonso, if there is a hell, I visited it in my dream
                     this night!"
                  The conversation of the two was interrupted by the same sound that Guy had
                     heard alone. The two steeds pricked up their quick ears, snuffed the air, and
                     as they did so, first the head of one horseman was visible over the point of
                     rock around which he was coming, then another and another, and following in
                     quick order, they galloped recklessly into the arena and formed into line
                     before their leader.
                  A gallant and a daring band they formed, and a wild, picturesque group they
                     presented. Every variety of costume and dresses, according to the taste of the
                     owner, from the small, shining steel cap to the peaked hat of the Italian
                     bandit; from the cuirass of the dragoon to the gaily decorated jacket of the
                     hussar. Every style and every material figured in that strange group. They
                     silently dismounted to receive the orders of the chief, one or two were left to
                     take charge of the horses, and the rest gathered around him in silence and
                     alacrity. He detailed to them his plan, and as the sun rose on their glittering
                     forms, his order of "To horse!" had been echoed back by the neighboring rocks
                     and caves.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  NINA'S EARLY LOVE.
                  Nina stood on the mountain, gazing at the prospect spread out before her. She
                     saw the wide and fertile plain stretching far away on each side, its grassy
                     surface appearing like a field of rich green velvet, and the river that flowed
                     peacefully through, on its way to the sea, reminded the poor girl of another
                     river, not unlike it, in its winding course, far away in a land of hill and
                     dale, more beautiful and fertile than this. There, on the hill-side, from the
                     clustering vines, peeped out the blushing grape, there in that valley, far
                     away, stood the little village, with the cot where she was born. Did the vines
                     still bloom? did the grapes still cluster in the sun? did the village still
                     remain? Such were the various questions she asked herself, for she had no companion, no kind bosom friend, with
                     whom she could interchange her thoughts. Once again, in fancy, the poor, lone
                     girl stood in that oft-remembered valley, the evening song of the peasant
                     struck familiarly on her ear, and from the distance, mingling with the
                     whispering of the breeze, came the rippling music of the stream. The
                     honeysuckle still clambered o'er the rustic thatch, and the flowers breathed
                     fragrance on the air, while from the lattice window her mother's voice was
                     heard, and the voices of the children filled the garden with their glee. Nina
                     sat herself down on the moss beneath the pine tree, and her imperfect memory
                     reflected her past life, as the troubled lake reflects the blue vault
                     above.
                  She was born and bred in the little village of Belle-rive. At the age of
                     sixteen, Nina was almost a woman; her form was beautiful, and her reason then
                     was perfect. Beneath the sunny skies of France love grows more rapidly than
                     elsewhere, and indeed had the ancient mythologists not fixed the birthplace of
                     Venus in some other land, we might suppose that it was in the bosom of some of
                     the streams of France that the goddess of Love and Beauty rose refulgent from
                     the wave. Nina, one cool evening in June, had wandered some distance from the
                     little hamlet, lost in her thoughts and reflections. She was crossing a field
                     to return home, when a low, threatening sound struck upon her ear, and turning
                     in the direction from which the sound proceeded she saw a large and ferocious
                     wolf, whose deep growl it was that had attracted her attention. These animals
                     at that time infested the south of France, living in the woods, and sallying
                     out by times in search of food when hunger drove them forth. Nina, terrified
                     and bewildered, turned to fly, which the fierce animal perceiving, sprang after
                     her, with a howl which curdled the blood in her veins. He was almost upon her,
                     she could hear his panting breath close behind, she breathed a prayer and gave
                     herself up for lost. But at that moment a form sprang from the thicket close by
                     and intercepted the progress of the wolf. The furious animal turned upon the
                     stranger, and a struggle ensued, which was short but decisive, for the knife of
                     the young man had pierced his heart and breast in many places. So quickly was
                     this done that Nina had not time to speak a word. The wolf once motionless, the
                     intrepid young man drew the knife from its sheath in the animal's breast, stuck
                     it to the hilt in the ground once or twice, to cleanse it, wiped it on the skin
                     of the slain adversary, and quietly replaced it in its sheath at his waist. He
                     then stood before Nina, revealing the strong, well-knit frame of a young man of
                     twenty-one, with an honest and pleasing face and a form abounding in
                     muscle.
                  "Oh, sir!" exclaimed Nina, at length, her cheek suffused with blushes, which
                     only rendered her the prettier in the admiring eyes of the young man, "Oh, sir,
                     how shall I ever thank you for your noble conduct? Without you I should have
                     surely been torn to pieces by that furious animal, for hunger had rendered him
                     over bold."
                  "Mademoiselle," answered the youth, "I need no thanks, for the pleasure of
                     doing you a favor more than compensates for the risk attending it.
                     Mademoiselle, it is Providence that sent me to your deliverance this evening,
                     for seeing you walking out, I involuntarily followed your footsteps. I have
                     been here but for a few weeks, my father is the new blacksmith, and I am his
                     son, Gaspar. It is useless for you to tell me your name, for since I have been
                     here that name has formed the subject of all my thoughts and all my dreams. I
                     have watched you often in the evening, and been nearer you than you could
                     imagine at the time. Oh! Nina, I love you better than my own life, and all I
                     ask is that you can love me a little in return. I should then be the happiest
                     fellow in the village. Speak to me, then, Nina, may I hope?" And the blushing
                     Nina bade him hope, and sealed her mandate with his kiss upon her pure
                     forehead.
                  For those two young hearts the hours were no more numbered, they flew away so
                     rapidly, and Gaspar and Nina were affianced. The village priest had made all
                     ready. Gladness and rejoicing filled the village; flowers were gathered, and
                     wreaths were made, the feast was prepared, the wine stood in the bottles on the
                     old mantel-piece, and Nina and Gaspar, the objects of all these preparations,
                     walked around, perfectly unconscious of all these arrangements, for they were
                     perfectly wrapped up in each other.
                  E'er another sun had set, the one was destined to fall a sacrifice to the
                     barbarous laws of his country, and the other was destined, in one day, to be a
                     maiden, wife, and widow!
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  THE MAIDEN, WIFE, AND WIDOW.
                  My dear reader, does my description of the humble life of the peasant weary
                     your patience? Forgive my swerving from the direct course of my story, but I
                     think that we sometimes love to escape from the noise and bustle, and gayety of
                     the crowded city, and steal a few
                     days of quiet enjoyment in the country. One wearies of the constant rush and
                     tumult of the town, and sighs for the quiet nook beneath those old trees where
                     we played and sported in our infancy. And thus, I hope, dear reader, that you
                     may find this chapter not totally uninteresting, as it describes what is
                     happening every day in France.
                  The wedding day had come, the little bride had donned her wedding dress; she
                     wore no diamonds nor jewels of any description, but I will defy any one to find
                     a prettier and more graceful bride. The jewels she wore were nature's freshest
                     flowers, plucked that morning in the garden, the dew still sparkling on their
                     heads. She wore no lace nor satins, but the simple snowy dress, fit emblem of
                     purity and innocence, fitting tight to her lovely form, showed the perfect
                     proportions of her heaving breast, her tapering waist, and buttoned loosely
                     round her sculptured throat. Her little hands, not squeezed in little gloves,
                     bore no rings nor jewels, and no satins nor velvets decked her form. But,
                     reader, I have found that it is not always beneath satins, and velvets, and
                     costly lace, that beat the truest and the fondest hearts, nor is it always the
                     hand that is glittering in diamonds and in precious stones which you would do
                     well to clasp at the altar.
                  The day had come—the sun shone with its brightest rays, and nature bloomed and
                     smiled beneath the unclouded sky, as if she had put on her best holiday attire
                     to celebrate the happy scene. The village bell had scarcely ceased tolling, the
                     first of the little procession had not issued from the small gothic church,
                     after the ceremony which bound those two young hearts together for evermore,
                     when, coming nearer and nearer, louder and 
                        londer
                        louder
                     , came the sound of the beating drum! A grim terror, more awful,
                     because so undefined, seized upon all present, and the new made wife clung to
                     Gaspar's arm more tightly still. The wedding train passed from the church; they
                     were met by a band of troops marching through the village, to recruit men for
                     the war. They were ordered to halt; the men of the party were led out; the lots
                     were cast; the first one fell to Gaspar; he was ordered to stand in the rank;
                     with a heavy heart he obeyed, and tore himself from his wife's embrace. The
                     rest shared the same fate—that is, those to whom the lots fell—and they were
                     marched off to the tavern, to give rest to the troops, who were fatigued by
                     their long march. Nina was led home by her sorrowful bridesmaids.
                  About three hours afterwards Gaspar escaped from the guard that had the care of
                     the recruits, to bid a last farewell to his weeping bride. It was evening, and
                     he stole noiselessly to the house, but hearing voices in the garden, he pushed
                     open the gate and strode in, and there he saw in the little arbor a scene that
                     drove the blood leaping tumultuously to his heart and temples. Nina, his love,
                     his life, his all, was struggling in the grasp of an herculean trooper, whose
                     hand on her mouth prevented her screams from being heard. Passion and revenge
                     fired his brain, and drawing the sword that now hung at his side, he rushed to
                     the scene, and catching Nina from her assailant's arms, he grasped him by the
                     throat, and shook him with his whole force, and only released him when he had
                     become black in the face.
                  "I had thought to kill thee, thou traitorous wretch, but as it is I'll but
                     degrade thee. Here and here—and now begone!" Saying which he tore from each
                     shoulder the epaulettes of his rank and flung them at his feet, trampling them
                     in scorn into the dust; after which he actually kicked the would be ravisher
                     out of the garden gate, and across the way, to the great delight of the
                     villagers attracted by his cries. He then returned to his bride, whom he found
                     fainting on the rustic seat. Her spotless dress was torn, profaned by lustful
                     hands; her hair was disordered; her beautiful neck bruised in the struggle she
                     had undergone. She opened her eyes at length to gaze upon her husband, and with
                     a scream of joy she buried her head in his bosom.
                  Their conference was interrupted by a file of soldiers, who came to the arbor
                     and claimed him as their prisoner. They placed chains on his feet and wrists,
                     and thus manacled he was led through the village, amid the sympathy of all.
                  
                  The next morning, at day-break, the inhabitants were notified that Gaspar was
                     to be shot! The fatal volley that deprived him of life deprived the wife of
                     reason. He was shot for defending her from insult, but the sentence passed upon
                     him by the court-martial was—"To be shot for striking a superior officer!"
                  Nina was never more seen in her native village, she wandered away into Spain,
                     where she fell a prey to the fiendish designs of the implacable Guy Romez.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  MIGUEL AND JULIA IN THE ROBBER'S CAVE.
                  Dear reader, the story which we have just related is not totally a fiction.
                     Conscripts are drawn from their homes every day, and especially lately, since
                     the bloody hand of War has stirred up the smouldering embers, and incited the
                     grasping avarice for
                     territory of a crowned tyrant on a foreign throne. The fat merchant, as he
                     looks in the newspapers for the prices of the markets and the state of the
                     consols, little recks he for the misery and wretchedness produced by the war,
                     provided he can fill his pockets with the proceeds of his speculations. Verily,
                     the blood-thirsty NICHOLAS, on his throne, is not more of a tyrant than is the
                     almighty dollar in this free republic of America!
                  Dear reader, when you read of battles and struggles which are shortly to come
                     to our ears, think of the lonely, anxious hearts waiting by the window, in the
                     native village, waiting and watching for the courier who shall bring the news
                     of the battle; how eagerly they peruse the list of killed and wounded, and how
                     despairing is the shriek when the oft repeated name meets their eye.
                  Battles are glorious and soul-stirring, but the huzzas and shouts of victory
                     drown the groans and cries that are torn from the despairing hearts of mothers,
                     and orphans, and sisters, and wives!
                  Reader, the writer of these chapters once saw four thousand newly recruited
                     troops marching through a village in France, in which he was residing for his
                     health, on their way to Africa. Out of that band, he afterwards learnt, only
                        seven hundred ever returned home! What the enemy had failed to
                     conquer, the poisonous fever had laid low.
                  
                  We left Nina seated beneath the shade of one of the mountain pines, gazing down
                     into the valley spread out before her. The next morning found her again in her
                     accustomed place, and ere long her patience was rewarded, for she saw the file
                     of men moving slowly along in the distance. But an hour had elapsed when they
                     arrived at the cave. They bore in their midst a litter, out of which, to the
                     surprise of Nina, there stepped a beautiful and elegant woman, much taller and
                     much darker than herself. She watched this beautiful personage with the eye of
                     a tigress, for she beheld how devoted and how respectful Guy appeared to be to
                     her. She mechanically followed at a distance, as the captive Julia was being
                     led along by the chief to the apartment devoted to her safe keeping. Don Miguel
                     followed slowly between two guards; he had no sword at his side, nor other
                     arms, for they had been removed by order of the robber-chief.
                  Had Miguel's good sword been then hanging at his side it is probable that Julia
                     would not have been long a prisoner. The two lovers, the evening before, had
                     gone to attend a peasant's festival, held at a neighboring village. They had
                     watched with pleasure the gayety and rejoicing of the honest villagers, and the
                     darkness had already set in ere they started on their homeward
                      way. They were obliged to pass
                     through a little patch of woodland, where the branches and leaves were so thick
                     overhead that a complete darkness wrapped its folds over and around them as
                     they passed beneath. They had reached the middle of this little wood when Don
                     Miguel felt himself suddenly seized from behind by two stalwart men, the bridle
                     of his steed was held fast by another, and he was dragged from his saddle,
                     without the power of moving hand or foot. The lady Julia felt the bridle of her
                     horse pulled gently but firmly from her hand, and she saw the plumes of two men
                     who were walking, one on each side.
                  In this manner they reached the open ground, where the twilight showed them
                     their captors. They consisted of a band of twelve, headed by a large and
                     stern-looking chieftain, whom, when he turned around, Don Miguel immediately
                     recognized as Don Pedro.
                  Don Miguel appeared perfectly passive, but he was watching with eagle eye, the
                     opportunity to escape.
                  "Sir Miguel," said Guy Romez, approaching him, extending his hand, "It grieves
                     me to meet you thus, and to be obliged to speak such words as those which are
                     now on my lips. But, fair sir, duty is duty, and I have to warn you that if you
                     give not your knightly word of honor not to attempt to escape from our hands,
                     we shall be compelled to bind you hand and foot, and bring you with us by
                     force. Choose, sir, and name to me your choice. Fair means or foul?"
                  Don Miguel sternly and scornfully refused the proffered hand of the bandit, and
                     seeing the utter hopelessness of escape at present, besides, not wishing to
                     incur the degradation of being tied before the very eyes of his mistress, he
                     gave his parole of honor not to attempt his escape, and to follow where his
                     conductors might lead.
                  When this conversation had been gone through with, Guy Romez mounted his horse,
                     and taking the head of the escort, by the litter of the lady Julia, he gave the
                     orders to march. The men sprang into their saddles with alacrity. Don Miguel's
                     steed was restored to him, and the party traveling slowly all night, reached
                     the cave early the next morning.
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  THE BANDIT'S REVENGE.
                  The lady Julia sat in the gorgeous apartment 
                        alotted
                        allotted
                      to her; her head drooped mournfully on her breast. The hopelessness
                     of her desolate situation came upon her with terrific force; she felt herself
                     in the power of a man relentless, remorseless, and an outlaw to his country, on
                     whose head a price was set. The beauty and gorgeousness of her prison did not
                     occupy her attention; she tried the door, she sounded the walls with her
                     knuckles, she tried the fastenings of the little door on the side of the room,
                     but all in vain. She was still ruminating on the hopelessness of escape when
                     the side door opened noiselessly and slowly. Julia's heart beat high, she
                     grasped the poignard in her bosom, but quickly replaced it on seeing who was
                     the intruder. The visitor entered stealthily, seeming to glide rather than walk
                     into the room. It was Nina. She was very pale; her long, fair hair fell over
                     her marble shoulders; her tiny feet, thrust into embroidered slippers, were
                     naked and white as snow. She seemed to have just risen from her couch and
                     thrown on her dressing gown in great haste. For one moment the two women gazed
                     upon each other in silence.
                  The next Nina advanced towards Julia, and clasping her beautiful hands
                     together, she exclaimed, with an imploring expression beaming from out her dark
                     eyes, her quivering lip and pale cheek betokening the anxiety with which she
                     awaited an answer, "Why comes the beautiful stranger to the mountain girl's
                     home, to rob her of her only treasure? Why should they take from her everything
                     that she loves? They murdered her husband—poor Gaspar—and now thou art come to
                     take my chief from mine arms; he is all I have left me now to love. Oh, lady,
                     go away to thy home and leave the chieftain to his bride."
                  And Nina knelt at the feet of Julia, her clasped hands and tearful eyes raised
                     towards her pitying face. A bright idea shot through her brain, and she smiled
                     a joyful smile.
                  "Yes, child, I will promise thee that I will leave this place if thou wilt
                     promise me to do whatsoever I shall tell thee. Thou knowest the youth that came
                     here with me?"
                  "The fair-faced young man with the rosy plume, with the soft blue eyes, that
                     speaks to Nina of the youths of her native France? Right well I know of whom thou speakest,
                     lady, and I can have speech with him if such be thy pleasure, for here all
                     doors open to me."
                  "Go, then, Nina, fly as swift as thy little feet can patter along these gloomy
                     halls. Go thou, and by some means which thou shalt invent, give him this note."
                     And Julia rapidly tore a leaf from her tablet, and writing a few words in
                     pencil, she gave it to Nina, who disappeared, and in the space of a few moments
                     returned.
                  "Lady," said she, "the youth is no longer there; Juan, the sentinel, is lying
                     on the floor asleep, and they have changed their clothes. He is gone!"
                  "He sleeps the last sleep, then, and ere this Miguel is on his way to Madrid,"
                     muttered Julia to herself, adding aloud, "Speak not a word of this to any one,
                     dear Nina. Stay thou with me; thou shalt give me thy history, sweet girl, and
                     we will while the hours away together."
                  Nina, surprised at this outburst of kindness from one in whom she had expected
                     to find an enemy, burst into tears, and threw herself into Julia's arms. Julia
                     mingled her tears with those of the lost, betrayed maiden, who, happily for
                     herself, could not know the degradation to which she had fallen. The hours
                     passed on thus in mutual confessions and confidences, and night spread her
                     pinions over the drowsy world. Nina was about to withdraw, when footsteps were
                     heard hurrying to and fro in the corridors. Shouts, and cries, and
                     exclamations, mingling together, gave signs of the commotion and tumult
                     without. The next moment a mailed footstep was heard rapidly approaching the
                     room in which the two young women were seated. The door was flung open with a
                     crash, and Guy Romez stalked furiously into the apartment. He advanced towards
                     Nina, and catching her by her long, flowing hair, he drew the dagger from his
                     belt and plunged it, with a savage execration, in the breast of his victim. The
                     poor murdered girl gave one shriek and fell to the floor. Raising herself on
                     her arm, she exclaimed, feebly, "Take me in thine arms, Guy, thy Nina is dying.
                     Let me lay my head upon thy breast and I am content."
                  "Aye, die there, traitress as thou art. Never shalt thou touch the breast of
                     Guy Romez. Thus, madam," he continued, turning to the horrified Julia, "thus,
                     madam, we punish treason, and when you become what that thing is now, then take
                     warning from her fate!"
                  The unfortunate Nina was seen to go to the room of Don Miguel and to return. It
                     was supposed that she had liberated and guided him from the cave. The brutal
                     words of Guy Romez cut far deeper into that bleeding breast than did his
                     murderous dagger. At that moment his quick ear caught the sound of conflict
                     without, and he hastened from the cave.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  THE END.
                  Julia supported the head of the dying Nina on her breast. Now that death was
                     hovering over, with wings ready for flight, the light of madness that shone in
                     her soft brown eyes faded away, and reason beamed once more from those pure
                     orbs. Julia bent over her, weeping bitterly; her gentle heart was suffused with
                     pity for the gentle being who, though so young, had yet suffered so much.
                  Nina's pale lips tried to utter a prayer for her sinful soul. Julia bent down
                     her head and whispered in the dying girl's ear, "Nina, remember, dearest, that
                        He pardoned Mary, who had much sinned, because she had much
                     loved!"
                  It was as the breath of spirits on the heart of Nina; it seemed to her that
                     angel voices were whispering in her ears and angel wings were fluttering around
                     her to carry her to Heaven. What were the sights she saw that brought that
                     heavenly smile to her lips, what were the whispered promises that bathed her
                     soul in the sunlight of hope, it is not for mortal pen to write, nor mortal
                     mind to determine. There, unconscious of the strife and tumult without,
                     dreaming only of the holy calm within, with no agony and without pain, the
                     spirit of the gentle sufferer escaped from earth, and let us hope, dear reader,
                     Nina sleeps on her Gaspar's bosom once again.
                  The lady Julia fell upon her knees, and burning, earnest prayers went up to
                     Heaven from the pure fountain of her virgin heart. A step echoed behind her;
                     she turned her head and she was seized in the arms of Guy Romez; his drawn
                     sword, still in his bloody hand, was smeared and dabbled in gore, his dress was
                     torn and disordered, and everything told of the dreadful struggle through which
                     he had just passed.
                  "All is lost!" he exclaimed, as he wound his arms around her form—"all is lost;
                     but thou art still left to me; though I am conquered by his superior force,
                     still I'll leave him something to regret during a long life of misery!"
                  Julia slipped from his grasp, but she was again seized, and his hated embrace
                     closed round her. In vain she implored and
                      threatened; he heeded her not; her velvet dress was loose; her raven
                     hair, unbound from its tresses, fell around her form; her pallid face and wild
                     appealing eyes had no effect on the bandit save to push him still more
                     determinately to his purpose. His breath was on her cheek, his foul lips had
                     been pressed to hers, and Julia's strength was well nigh exhausted when a sabre
                     waved in the air and fell on the head of Guy Romez. He released his prey,
                     seized his sword and rushed furiously on his antagonist. The gallant Miguel met
                     his attack with calm, determined bravery, for he knew that he was not only
                     fighting for his life, but for the honor of her whose life was much dearer to
                     him than his own life. Sparks flashed from the clashing blades, which leaped to
                     and fro like living things; now high, now low, now covered with blood and
                     flashing high again. Guy Romez lunged desperately forward; his foot slipped in
                     the blood of Nina, and as he fell forward the sword of Don Miguel pierced his
                     heart. A hellish curse, and a shriek of baffled revenge and lust broke from the
                     bloody lips of the robber, and with the echo of that demoniac cry fled the
                     spirit of the terrible GUY ROMEZ.
                  READER, our tale is done for the present, when we inform you that Don Miguel
                     and Julia were united but a short time after the scenes herein related. Of
                     their offspring and their achievements in the war which has lately attracted
                     the attention of the whole civilized world, we will speak in a book which will
                     shortly follow this one, and in which, dear reader, if this tale has amused a
                     leisure hour or two, we shall only be too happy to meet you again.

                  CHAPTER I.

                     MURRELL—THE OATH—"THIS COUNTRY SHALL BE AN EMPIRE!—ITS PEOPLE MY SLAVES"—THE
                     TWIN BROTHERS.
                  In the north-western part of the state of Alabama, and not far from the city of
                     C——e, there is a high mountain, the sides of which are covered with rocks and
                     small dwarf-like trees. The mountain rises in an almost perpendicular position
                     from the ground; and few if any persons have ventured to climb up the sides.
                     Those who have dared to surmount the many difficulties which lie in their way,
                     speak with delight of the almost endless view of the surrounding scenery which
                     may be had from the top. Far in the distance may be seen the river which gives
                     the state its name; the white steeples and roofs of the city; the cattle
                     grazing in the meadows; the white sails of the many vessels which glide up and
                     down the river, and which add wealth to every place they visit. There may be
                     heard the singing of the birds, the sighing of the wind among the trees, and
                     the low rumbling murmur of the distant waterfall. It is a beautiful place, and
                     if you once reach the peak of the mountain, you leave it with a sigh.
                  This mountain is known by the name of "Murrell mountain," the reason of which
                     will be seen hereafter.
                  It was a dark and stormy night in November, year 18—, that two men might have
                     been seen riding slowly along the road that led from the city to the mountain.
                     One of them was a short, thin man, whose features were strongly marked with
                     mildness and benevolence. He was dressed in a suit of black. In a belt around
                     his waist were stuck a pair of pistols and a huge knife, made celebrated by its
                     bearing the name of the gallant Col. James Bowie, of Texas. In the holsters of
                     his saddle were a pair of large horse pistols, the barrels and handles of which
                     were splendidly mounted. Hanging by a strap over his back was a rifle, the bore of which was scarcely
                     larger than a pin's head. To protect his arms from getting wet he wore a cloak
                     over his shoulders, which almost concealed his features from view. His horse
                     was of that small breed more noted for swiftness than strength. Every movement
                     of this man, even to the lifting of his rein, was done in a studious manner.
                     Few looking at him would have thought that he was one of the greatest villains
                     that ever lived.
                  His companion was full seven feet in height; his breadth across the shoulders
                     was enormous; his eye was bright and piercing; his hair of a bright chestnut
                     color; his forehead high and noble; his nose Roman. His face had that dark
                     shade which indicates constant exposure to the sun. His clothes, though not
                     very neat were yet clean. The bosom of his shirt was thrown open, exposing the
                     broad bosom which lay beneath it, and which was of the same color as the face.
                     He was armed like his companion, with the exception that his pistols were not
                     ornamented, and his knife was somewhat larger. He also carried a huge axe in
                     his belt.
                  "Well," said the smaller of the two, "we have not much farther to go."
                  "Glad to hear it," said the giant; "my clothes are wet through, and the
                     moschetoes bite so that I can't stand it much longer."
                  "Aye, you say truly," said the other; "this place is noted for its moschetoes,
                     if nothing else. But hush! we are close to the mountain, and the sentinels may
                     fire at us through mistake."
                  The caution was not unnecessary, for hardly had the word been spoken, when a
                     vivid flash of lightning revealed the figure of a man standing on one of the
                     crags within fifty feet of them.
                  "A gloomy looking place," said the giant, in a low voice. The other smiled.
                  "Little do the inhabitants of yonder city," said he, "dream that I, the terror
                     of the south-west, am so near them. They have spies scattered all over the
                     country to catch me; but it is in vain. 'The Land Pirate,' as they delight to
                     call me, is not to be caught so easily. Fools!" he exclaimed, shaking his
                     clenched fist towards the city, "ye do not know that this country was made to
                     be my empire; its people my slaves. Ere a year shall have passed, ye shall be
                     slain, your houses destroyed; and by whom? The slaves of——"
                  He paused suddenly, and fixed his dark eyes on the face of his companion, who,
                     with head bent forward was eagerly listening to what he was saying.
                  "You are not yet a member of our band," he said.
                  "But I soon shall be," said the giant.
                  "True, but our secrets cannot be told to any one but the members."
                  "Who goes there! who goes there!" shouted the sentinel, as a vivid flash of
                     lightning revealed to him the two men. Without giving them time to reply, he
                     raised his musket to his shoulders and fired. The bullet whistled between the
                     two men without doing any mischief. "Friends!" shouted the smaller of the two;
                     "friends! You are too quick with your gun;" he added, in a stern voice. "Lower
                     the ladder."
                  The sentinel obeyed. Both men sprang from their horses, and after tying them to
                     a tree, they mounted the ladder, the smaller one leading the way. As soon as
                     they reached the top, the sentinel spoke.
                  "You bring a new man with you, captain."
                  "Yes. Are the men assembled?"
                  "Yes."
                  "All?"
                  "I believe so."
                  "Keep a good look out. Come;" and taking hold of his companion's hand he
                     plunged beneath a rock and touched a spring. Part of the rock immediately flew
                     open, revealing a small entrance which had been cut through the solid rock. The
                     captain drew the other into the passage.
                  "Show a light within there," he said, in a loud commanding voice.
                  The glare of several torches flashed along the walls. The captain again moved
                     forward, followed by the other. After walking several rods he stopped.
                  "Give me your hand," he said. "See you this narrow plank? Keep your eye on it;
                     look neither to the right nor left. A false step and you are lost."
                  "Why do you 
                        not not
                        not
                      cover it over?" asked the other.
                  The captain laughed.
                  "You do not understand," he said. "When we are apprehensive of an attack from
                     the police, when we are afraid that they have discovered our cave, we merely
                     draw this board to the other side, and they, not knowing it, will fall at least
                     fifty feet before they stop."
                  His companion shuddered.
                  "A happy contrivance, is it not?" said the captain. "But come; we have but a
                     short distance to go."
                  Both men stepped cautiously over the plank. On reaching the other side the
                     captain clapped his hands three times. Scarcely had the echoes died away when
                     an iron door flew open, and they found themselves in a large room, which was
                     brilliantly illuminated by numerous torches stuck in the wall, and by an
                     immense chandelier which hung from the ceiling.
                  
                  For a moment the captain's companion closed his eyes: the light was too
                     dazzling for him to bear. When he again opened them he started back in
                     astonishment at the scene which met his view.
                  The cave was filled with men; all of them, with the exception of the captain,
                     wore dark cloaks and masks, which concealed their features from view. There
                     were at least five hundred men in the cave. At the upper end of the cave was a
                     raised platform, with three chairs on it. Two of these chairs were occupied;
                     the middle one was empty. To conceal the bare walls, and to make the place look
                     as comfortable as possible, large curtains hung from the ceiling to the ground.
                     All of the men had their eyes fixed on the platform. For an instant the captain
                     enjoyed the other's astonishment, and then waving his hand, he spoke:
                  "I have brought a new man to join our league," he said. "Stand on that
                     platform," said he. "Has any man anything to say against this man joining
                     us?"
                  For an instant the men silently surveyed him through their masks. One of them
                     rose.
                  "I know nothing against him," he said; and he seated himself.
                  "If any man has anything to say against him," said the captain, "led him rise
                     and speak."
                  All remained seated.
                  "Good," said the captain. "Are you willing to take the oath?"
                  "Yes," said the other, boldly.
                  "Kneel," said the captain. The other obeyed.
                  "Are you willing to be branded?" asked the captain.
                  For a moment the other hesitated.
                  "Where?" he asked.
                  "On the breast."
                  Without a word he bared his bosom. The captain waved his hand. A red-hot iron
                     was brought him. For an instant he pressed it against the giant's breast, and
                     then flung it into a tub of water which stood behind him.
                  "Your name?" he asked.
                  "Charles Demmon," was the reply.
                  "Read the oath," said the captain.
                  One of the men rose and read from a paper which was nailed on the table.
                     Without faltering, the other pronounced the words after him.
                  "Rise," said the captain, extending his hand. "You have known me under the name
                     of Phillips; know me now under my real name—John A. Murrell."
                  Demmon grasped his hand.
                  "I knew you from the first," he said.
                  "Charles Demmon," said Murrell, "you are now a member of our band,—the dreaded
                     banditti of the West. Soon you will know all our signs and pass-words. Do you
                     know why this band is leagued together?"
                  "I do not."
                  "To promote the interests of its members; to make this country an empire; to
                     make me its emperor. We count much upon the slaves of the South and South-west.
                     Men of wealth and respectability, and even ministers of the gospel, belong to
                     the band. Our influence is extended all over the States, from Maine to Texas.
                     Our agents are in every place. Our wealth is immense, for we number among our
                     members several of the best forgers and counterfeiters in the country. Your
                     duty is, to do everything in your power to increase our influence. Remember you
                     are ours, body and soul, and you must obey me. You will be surrounded with
                     spies, who, if you attempt to betray us, will strike you dead. If you are in
                     danger, you will only have to make this sign," and the captain made a sign with
                     his finger, "and aid will come to you. If you are arrested, fear not to make
                     the sign to the judge. Woe unto you if you attempt to betray us, for our power
                     is great; our agents are everywhere."
                  "You shall never have cause to regret my joining you," said Demmon. "Few equal
                     me in strength; in all exercises I am a master."
                  A few words more passed between them, and then the captain motioned Demmon to
                     seat himself.
                  "Men," said Murrell, "it is six weeks since our last meeting. What have you
                     done to aid our cause?"
                  One of them rose.
                  "Speak," said Murrell.
                  "I have gained thirty members," he said, with a look of pride.
                  "Good," said Murrell.
                  "And I," said another, "have passed all the money you gave me. I sold it all to
                     one man, and he paid me in cash eighty thousand dollars."
                  "Who is he?" asked Murrell.
                  "A broker," was the reply; "his name is A——t Z——g."
                  "Is he rich?" asked Murrell, quickly.
                  "He is said to be a millionaire."
                  "Good," said Murrell; "he is in our power. Think you he will join us?"
                  "He dare not refuse," replied the other.
                  Murrell drew a book from his pocket, and wrote the broker's name therein.
                  "I will visit him to-morrow," he said. "What have you done, L——x?"
                  "Not much," was the reply.
                  
                  "Have you gained any members?"
                  "No; but I have got my eye fixed on two persons."
                  "Who are they?"
                  "Brothers, twin brothers. They are so like each other that no one can scarcely
                     tell them apart. They formerly resided in Baltimore, but have lately removed to
                     the city near by. They work in a dry goods store."
                  "Are you acquainted with them?"
                  "I am."
                  "Are they honest?"
                  "They appear to be."
                  "That is unfortunate."
                  "It will not stand in the way."
                  "No; I will visit them to-morrow."
                  In an hour the meeting broke up. As Demmon entered the city, he exclaimed, "I
                     shall find her yet! I shall find her yet!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE DRY GOODS STORE—THE TWIN BROTHERS—THE SISTER—THE BLOW—THE
                     ARREST—THE TRIAL—W. . . . R AGAIN—JOHN A. MURRELL—THE OATH—THE PARDON—THE
                     RING—THE DEPARTURE.
                  In Weslyn street, near Caroline, stands a large and handsome brick building.
                     The lower part is used as a dry goods store; the upper part, as a dwelling
                     house. The store is fitted up in a superior manner. It is full one hundred feet
                     deep, by twenty-five wide. Two large marble counters run from the front to the
                     back. Behind the counters are numerous shelves, filled with dry goods. Behind
                     one of these counters stands a tall, finely-formed young man, apparently
                     between twenty-five and twenty-six years of age. His pale and intellectual
                     countenance wears an air of sadness. His features are beautiful, and formed in
                     the classic mould. His name is Albert B. Eganus.
                  At the upper end of the store stands another young man, the exact counterpart
                     of the other. He is dressed in the same manner;—his features wear the same air
                     of sadness. No one can mistake him. His name is Cornelius D. Eganus, the twin
                     brother of Albert.
                  Seated on a stool, at the upper end of the store, is a tall, portly looking
                     man. His face wears a smiling expression, which never leaves it. He is dressed
                     in the most fashionable style. His name is W——r; he is the proprietor of the
                     store.
                  "Business is rather dull, to-day," said Mr. W——r.
                  "Rather so," said Albert.
                  At this moment the door opened, and a young lady entered. Her features were
                     very beautiful. Her face wore a winning smile, which added another charm to her
                     features. She was attired in a close fitting silk dress; every movement was
                     graceful; her teeth were pearly white, and her lips of a cherry red. As she
                     entered, Mr. W——r raised his head.
                  "By heavens!" he muttered to himself, "there she is again, and Oh! beautiful,
                     more beautiful than ever. The fairest flower of Paradise would not equal her.
                     Be still, thou throbbing breast, and let me hear her voice."
                  "Ellen," said Albert, casting at the same time a glance to W——r, "you here
                     again?"
                  Ellen blushed deeply.
                  "I could not help stopping to see you," she said. "A gentleman—a clergyman, I
                     think—stopped at our house this morning."
                  "What did he want?" asked Albert, quickly, and turning pale.
                  "To see you," replied Ellen. "He left this note for you;" and she handed him a
                     small, neatly folded note.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Sir: I wish to see you this evening—say at eight o'clock. I have
                                 something of importance to say to you and your brother. Do not go
                                 out this evening.
                              
                                 Yours,
                                 JAMES PHILLIPS."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "Phillips! Phillips!" said Albert, musingly, "the name is unknown to me. What
                     does he want with me?"
                  "I do not know," replied Ellen. "You will not fail him. I think I have seen him
                     before, but where I know not;" and with a pleasant smile she left the
                     store.
                  Mr. W——r rose from his chair and walked rapidly to and fro. There was a deep
                     flush on his forehead, and his form trembled so that it required a violent
                     exertion on his part to prevent the two clerks from noticing his agitation.
                  "God help me!" he muttered to himself, "but I have tried in vain to subdue this
                     passion which is now consuming my heart. Would that we had never met! "Would
                     that the family had remained in Baltimore! I love her madly, and would make her
                     mine; but my wife! Fool that I was to throw myself away upon her. But what has
                     she to do with this new passion? Does she stand in the way? No! the brothers
                     are poor, and Ellen is an orphan. I am rich and respected. Money is power. To possess Ellen I would
                     be willing to give one-half of my wealth. Were it not for her brothers I'd soon
                     make her mine. Would that I could get them into my power. But a truce to these
                     thoughts;" and he seated himself.
                  Suddenly he spoke:
                  "Did I not say yesterday that to-morrow we must take an account of stock?" he
                     asked.
                  "Yes," replied Albert, in a faint voice.
                  "Get down the books," said W——r.
                  In five hours they had taken "an account of stock," at the conclusion of which
                     Mr. W——r manifested the greatest surprise.
                  "Several very valuable things are missing," he said. "Hand me that book.
                     Perhaps they were sold."
                  "Strange," said he, a few minutes after; "I purchased three very valuable
                     shawls last year. They are not among the stock, neither do I see them marked
                     down in the sale-book."
                  "Mr. W——r," said Albert, in a faltering voice, "the shawls were sold. I sold
                     them."
                  "But the money, where is it?"
                  "It paid my father's funeral."
                  A smile of joy passed over W——r's features.
                  "Hear me," said Albert; "when we first came to the city we were poor, miserably
                     poor. My mother was taken ill and she died. My father was taken ill; the
                     weather was very cold, and he suffered greatly. Our wages were insufficient to
                     support us. We owed the doctor a large sum. He refused to visit us again unless
                     we paid him. What could I do? What would any one have done if he had been in my
                     place?"
                  "So, with the money you received for the shawls you paid the doctor?" said
                     W——r.
                  "Part of it paid him. I intended, as soon as my father got better, to return
                     the money as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, he died, and the remainder of
                     the money went to the sexton."
                  "And so I am to lose that money?" said W——r, in a cold tone.
                  "Not so," said the young man; "I will return it to you as soon as I can get
                     it."
                  W——r smiled grimly.
                  "What if I were to bring an officer here and have you arrested?" he said.
                  "Oh, you will not do that," said Albert, entreatingly.
                  "You would be tried, convicted, and sent to prison."
                  Albert clasped his hands.
                  
                     
                  
                  
                  "You would be pointed at, scorned—your reputation would be blasted
                     forever."
                  "Why torture me thus?" said Albert.
                  "Your sister—how would she feel to see her brother in the felon's dock?" and
                     the man bent his still smiling face upon the almost broken-hearted young
                     man.
                  "You will not do it!" said Cornelius.
                  "I will;" and he rose.
                  "Stay," said Albert, grasping his hand and sinking on his knees; "you surely
                     will not do this."
                  "But one thing will prevent me!"
                  "And that is—what?"
                  "Your sister."
                  Albert turned pale.
                  "Make her mine and"—
                  With the quickness of lightning Albert raised his fist and dashed him to the
                     floor. Then planting his foot firmly on his neck, he seized a stool, and raised
                     it high above his head. Ere he could give the blow, Cornelius wrested it from
                     him.
                  "Rise," he said.
                  Almost choking with passion, W——r obeyed, and shaking his clenched fist at
                     Albert, he left the store.
                  The two brothers looked at each other with dismay. Before they had time to
                     speak, W——r returned, accompanied by an officer.
                  "Arrest that man!" he said, pointing to Albert. The officer sprang forward and
                     laid his hand on his shoulder. Albert did not resist him. In an hour he was in
                     prison.
                  Two hours after, he was visited by his sister, who attempted to console him,
                     but it was in vain.
                  Three hours after, he was tried and found guilty. The next day he would receive
                     his sentence.
                  The clock was just striking the hour of six when the door opened and W——r
                     entered the cell. For an instant the young man glared at him, and then covered
                     his face with his hands.
                  "What do you want here?" he asked suddenly.
                  "To-morrow," said W——r, "you will be brought up to receive sentence."
                  The young man shuddered.
                  "Five years in prison."
                  "Five years!" shouted Albert, springing from his chair. "Do you know what five
                     years in prison are to the young heart? Five years! Good heavens! Three years
                     will kill me."
                  "I can save you."
                  "How?"
                  "The judge is my friend; he will do whatever I wish. Your sister—what say
                     you?"
                  "I," said the young man, hardly knowing what he was saying, "I——"
                  "Refuse your offer," said a voice, and John A. Murrell, the land-pirate,
                     entered the room. His features were concealed by a cloak.
                  Albert and W——r gazed at him with astonishment.
                  "What want you here?" cried W——r.
                  "To converse with this young man," was the reply.
                  "Leave the room," said W——r, angrily.
                  "Leave it yourself," said Murrell. "What! dare disobey me;" and Murrell threw
                     open his cloak and exposed his features. W——r staggered back.
                  "Go!" said Murrell, pointing to the door.
                  Without daring to say a word, he left the place. When the noise of his
                     retreating footsteps had died away, Murrell locked the door.
                  "Your name is Albert B. Eganas," said he. The young man bowed his head. "My
                     name," continued the other, "is Murrell."
                  Albert half darted from his chair.
                  "Sit still," said Murrell. "I have not long to stay, and when I begin a thing I
                     always like to finish it as soon as possible. A few minutes ago I heard of your
                     arrest and trial. To-morrow you will be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
                     I can save you."
                  "At the same price W——r demanded?"
                  "No; an easier one."
                  "The price! the price?"
                  "That you and your brother join my band."
                  "But how can you save me?"
                  "The judge, before whom you were tried to-day, belongs to my band. He has taken
                     the oath, and is therefore bound to obey me in everything."
                  "Enough," said Albert; "I am yours."
                  "Think you that your brother will join us?"
                  "I do!"
                  Murrell was overjoyed.
                  "You must take the oath now."
                  "If you wish it—yes."
                  Murrell administered the oath, and the young man slowly repeated it after
                     him.
                  "And now hear what you have to do," said Murrell, and he repeated, word for
                     word, what he had told Demmon the last evening. The young man was
                     horror-struck.
                  
                  "Good heavens!" he exclaimed, "this is horrible."
                  "Too late now," said Murrell, with a sardonic smile. "Better to live a life of
                     pleasure than to die in prison."
                  "Woe to the man who brought this upon me," said Albert. "W——r shall die a most
                     horrible death."
                  "Do as you please to him," said Murrell. "He is not a very valuable member;
                     besides he is old. We want young men. Here are ten thousand dollars. They are
                     counterfeits, yet no one can tell them from the real. When you have passed
                     them, you must return me five thousand dollars in good money."
                  Albert took the bills and thrust them in his pocket.
                  In a few minutes the door opened and Cornelius entered. In a few words Albert
                     informed him of what had occurred.
                  "Since you wish it, dear Albert," he said, "I will join the league. Speak the
                     oath, sir, I will repeat it after you."
                  In a few minutes Cornelius was a member of the league.
                  "Do you wish to leave the prison now?" asked Murrell.
                  "No; to-morrow will be time enough," was the reply; and seeing that his brother
                     looked surprised, he added, "I wish to brood over my wrongs and think of
                     vengeance."
                  "It will be the best for you to leave the prison to-night," said Murrell.
                     "Remain here till I return. I must get a pardon from the judge;" and he left
                     the room.
                  In a few minutes he returned. In his hand he held a paper.
                  "Here is the pardon," said he. "Remember, in four weeks we meet at the cave. I
                     will give you a sign by which you can gain admittance;" and he moved his hands
                     in a peculiar manner. "Take this ring, and whenever you need help, show it;"
                     and he left the room.
                  A few words more passed between the brothers, and they both left the place.
                     Soon they were walking swiftly towards their residence.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  ELLEN AND W——R—THE BROTHER'S RESCUE—THE MURDER—THE ARREST—THE
                     JAILER—THE LAND-PIRATE—THE ESCAPE—THE TRAITOR—THE OATH—THE TRAITOR'S REWARD—THE
                     PURSUIT—HO FOR THE NORTH.
                  On leaving the prison, W——r hailed a cab. As it drew up to the sidewalk he
                     sprang in. After receiving his orders, the driver drove at a smart pace towards
                     the center of the city.
                  "Curses on Murrell!" muttered W——r to himself; "he defeated me at the moment of
                     success. What does he want with Albert? Ah, I have it—to join the league.
                     Albert will refuse him; of that I am certain;" and he closed his eyes. Suddenly
                     he started up.
                  "What a lucky thought!" he almost exclaimed. "She lives alone, and no one will
                     interrupt us. Yes; I'll do it. Driver, turn your horse's head the other way.
                     Drive to 56 W——m street. Stop at No. 30. She may be looking out of the window,"
                     he said, "and if she should see me, she would flee," and W——r rubbed his hands
                     with glee.
                  In a few minutes the cab stopped. W——r got out, paid the driver his fare, and
                     dismissed the cab.
                  "So far so well," said he; and in a few minutes he stood in front of the young
                     lady's house. For a moment he hesitated, but mastering his fear, he mounted the
                     steps, and turned the handle of the door. It was locked. He then rang the bell,
                     and impatiently awaited for it to open.
                  In a few minutes he heard steps descending the stairs. Another moment and the
                     key was turned. Without giving the young lady time to open the door, he turned
                     the handle and sprang in, closing the door after him. On seeing him Ellen
                     uttered a slight scream, and leaned against the wall for support.
                  "Well, Ellen," said W——r, with a triumphant smile, "you are now mine. No
                     brother is here to save you."
                  "Leave the house," said Ellen.
                  "When you are mine—not before," was the reply.
                  "Yours!" said Ellen, proudly, "I shall never be yours. Leave the house, or I
                     will call for help."
                  "Your cries will avail you nothing," said W——r; and rushing forward, he caught
                     the young girl by the neck and covered her mouth with his hand. She struggled
                     to free herself from his grasp, but it was in vain. Opening a door, he dragged
                     her into a room and closed it. All this occupied several minutes.
                  "You see you are in my power," he said.
                  "God help me," murmured the poor girl. "Oh, Albert! would that you were
                     here."
                  "Albert is in prison," said W——r. "To-morrow he will be free. He has sold you
                     to me."
                  "Liar!" shouted a voice, and Albert sprang into the room, followed by his
                     brother. For a moment the young man glared at W——r with a look in which joy and
                     hate were intermingled together. W——r appeared like one paralyzed. Ellen
                     uttered a scream of joy.
                  The tableau lasted but a moment. With one
                     bound Albert caught the ruffian by the throat and bore him heavily to the floor. At the same
                     instant Cornelius snatched up an axe and raised it over his head.
                  "Move your body a little, Albert," he said, for the young man stood in such a
                     position that he could not strike without injuring his brother.
                  "Spare me!" cried W——r, vainly endeavoring to rise, and holding up his hands
                     entreatingly. "My God! you will not kill me! Spare—Oh! spare my life! For God's
                     sake, spare——"
                  The axe descended with such force that it buried itself in his brains. W——r
                     half rose from the floor, clasped his hands together, as though entreating for
                     mercy, and then fell dead upon the floor.
                  "Good God!" cried Ellen, "what have you done?"
                  "Sent the villain to where he belongs—to hell," said Albert.
                  Cornelius dropped the axe, and for a moment stood terror-stricken at the deed
                     he had committed.
                  "Come! be a man," said Albert, laying his hand on his shoulder.
                  "Oh! brother! brother! how could you do it?" said Ellen, Sobbing.
                  'Hush! would you alarm the neighbors by your cries?" said Albert. "What shall
                     we do, Cornelius?"
                  His brother made no reply to the question, but slowly raised his finger and
                     pointed to the body.
                  "He moves! he moves!" he cried. "Is he alive yet? Has his soul returned from
                     hell to confront me?"
                  "Hush!" said Albert, shaking him violently. "You know not what you say. He is
                     dead. Ellen, a glass of brandy! quick!"
                  "Drink," said Albert, when it was brought to him.
                  His brother obeyed.
                  "This is dreadful, Albert," he said.
                  "It cannot be helped," said Albert. "What shall we do with the body?"
                  Before Cornelius could reply, the door was dashed open, and several police
                     officers rushed into the room. The body of W——r at once made them comprehend of
                     what had occurred. The two brothers were seized, bound, and in another hour
                     lodged in prison.
                  "Our doom is sealed," said Cornelius, gloomily.
                  "Not so," said Albert, who was the bolder of the two. "See," and he held up his
                     finger. "I hold a ring which is almost as powerful as Alladin's lamp."
                  Cornelius' features brightened up.
                  The next morning, when the jailor entered the room, Albert asked, "Do you know
                     Murrell?"
                  
                     
                        BUNE
                     
                  
                  
                  "What of him?" inquired the man.
                  "Do you know him?" and Albert held up the ring.
                  "I see you belong to the league," said the man. "I am also a member of it."
                  "And by your oath you are bound to aid me."
                  "Willingly. Do you wish to see Phillips?—our leader goes under that name in
                     this city."
                  "Yes."
                  "He will be with you in an hour;" and the man left the room. In an hour Murrell
                     entered.
                  "A bad business," said he, "a very bad business. I saw your arrest in the
                     papers."
                  "We must escape," said Albert.
                  "That can be easily arranged," said Murrell. "The jailer belongs to our league.
                     We must bind him."
                  "Bind him!" repeated Albert.
                  "Yes; we do matters in such a way that suspicion falls on no one. To-night, at
                     nine, everything will be prepared."
                  "But Ellen—what will become of her?"
                  "She shall be attended to; fear not for her."
                  "Whither shall we go?"
                  "To the North. You can make a handsome living at the watering places. There you
                     will not be recognized. Two fleet horses will be ready for you at the end of
                     the city. I have a large number of counterfeit bills in my pocket, amounting to
                     over one hundred thousand dollars. Had you not better take them? You can
                     combine business with pleasure."
                  "Let us have them," said Albert.
                  Murrell drew a large roll of bills from his pocket, and handed it to
                     Albert.
                  "You will write to me often," said Murrell; "farewell; tonight we shall meet
                     again."
                  "We have no arms," said Albert.
                  "I will supply you to-night," said Murrell, and he left the room. Evening came.
                     At nine Murrell entered the rooms. The jailer suffered his arms to be bound
                     behind him, joking all the time with the men. When this was done, they
                     descended the stairs and left the prison. Soon they were mounted; the arms
                     which Murrell had provided for them placed in their belts; and in an hour they
                     had left the city far behind them.
                  At noon they reached a small country tavern. Several men were lounging about
                     the door. The two brothers threw themselves from their horses and called for
                     wine. As they were something tired, they resolved to remain there all night.
                     After drinking their wine, they requested the landlord to show them to their
                     rooms.
                  "Don't make a noise," said the landlord. "A sick gentleman, as has lost his
                     darter, is in the next room. The partitions are made out of boards, and o'
                     course the least noise made in one room can be heard in the next."
                  When night came, the two brothers undressed and went to bed. Through the cracks
                     they saw a bright light shining in the next room. Suddenly they heard a door
                     open. Albert motioned to his brother to keep silent, and springing from his
                     bed, he applied first his ear and then his eye to one of the cracks.
                  "Have you succeeded?" asked a voice.
                  "Beyond my utmost expectations; so far as to gain an admittance into the cave,"
                     replied the other.
                  "But my daughter—have you seen her?"
                  "Not yet; but I hope to see her soon."
                  "Is she in the cave?"
                  "She must be; where else would Murrell put her?"
                  "How are we to find out whether she is there or not?"
                  "That is the difficulty. My plan is to get a large number of men together—this
                     we can easily do by offering so much to every man—and to attack the cave."
                  "Think you that you'll succeed?"
                  "I should not attempt it if I were not sure of success."
                  "Poor M——a," said the other.
                  The sigh was echoed by his companion.
                  This companion, as our readers may have suspected, was Demmon.
                  "But how did you gain admittance into the cave?"
                  "I am a member of the league."
                  "Have you taken the oath?"
                  "Yes; but an oath made to such men is valueless;" and he informed the other
                     what had occurred at the cave.
                  "This is indeed a terrible plot," said the other. "The government must be
                     informed of it at once."
                  "This is sheer rashness," said Demmon. "If the leader is slain the league is
                     destroyed."
                  "'Tis lucky that our house is so near the cave," said the other.
                  "Perhaps your negroes have been tampered with."
                  "It may be so, but I'll soon find out. Do you intend to remain here all
                     night?"
                  "A few hours," replied the other. "Before daybreak I shall be up and far away.
                     I will collect all my friends and you must collect yours. As Murrell says,
                     'every man helps.' Is the adjoining room occupied?"
                  "I believe that the one on the right is."
                  "You should have told me so when I first entered the room. I'll sleep in the next room. If anything
                     happens, call me;" and he left the room.
                  For several moments the gentleman remained seated, with his face leaning on his
                     hand, and his elbow resting on the table. At length he rose and went to bed.
                     The lamp was extinguished, and all was darkness.
                  "Cornelius," said Albert, bending over his brother, and speaking in a hurried
                     tone, "did you hear their conversation?"
                  "Every word."
                  "What is to be done with him?"
                  "Let Murrell settle with him."
                  "Remember our oaths. We have sworn that if any suspicion rests on a member, to
                     slay him."
                  Cornelius shuddered.
                  "What have we to fear," said Albert. "Remember that we are in Murrell's power,
                     and if he should hear that we suffered this man to escape, he will say, 'behold
                     the murderers of W——r."
                  "And must we kill him?"
                  "Yes; have you not the heart to do it? You have only to hold him, and I will
                     strike the blow."
                  "Oh! Albert, every murder makes Heaven recede from us, and brings us nearer
                     Hell,"
                  "Let us do the deed," said Albert. "Come; he is in the next room. My knife is
                     sharp; a moment will finish the work."
                  "And send a soul before its Maker."
                  "Pshaw!" said Albert. "Get up; we will dress ourselves."
                  In a few minutes they were dressed.
                  "Put your shoes in the pocket of your great-coat," said Albert, as he opened
                     the door. A few steps brought them to the door of Demmon's room. Albert
                     listened attentively.
                  "He is sleeping," he said; and he opened the door without making any noise. A
                     lamp was burning on the mantel-piece. Demmon lay asleep upon the bed. In one
                     hand he held a small locket, the lid of which was open. Albert examined it. It
                     was the picture of a young lady of the most surpassing beauty. Cornelius sighed
                     as he beheld it; it reminded him of his sister. Demmon's features wore a smile;
                     he was dreaming. His chestnut locks waved over his high and noble forehead.
                     Both hands were folded over his broad bosom. His arms lay upon the table beside
                     the bed. He was a very model of Hercules; he looked like a lover dreaming of
                     his mistress.
                  "Poor fellow," said Cornelius, "and must he die?"
                  "Yes," said Albert, who, since the murder of W——r, appeared to have a delight
                     for blood, "he must die."
                  "Then strike?" said his brother. "If I remain here a moment ment longer, pity
                     will take possession of my heart, and I shall awaken him. Strike, I say, for
                     the angel of mercy is hovering over me with his wings."
                  Without hesitating a moment, Albert raised the knife and plunged it into his
                     heart. Demmon did not move, nor even groan. That one blow had freed his spirit,
                     and he was—where?
                  "The deed is done," said Albert, as he coolly wiped his knife on the sheets of
                     the bed. "Let us see if he has any money about him;" and taking up the clothes
                     which were lying on the foot of the bed, he emptied the pockets of their
                     contents. There was a large purse filled with gold, and a pocket-book stuffed
                     with bills. Albert chuckled over his ill-gotten gains.
                  Hearing a noise, both turned toward the door. There stood the landlord, his
                     features expressing both astonishment and fear. In his right hand he held a
                     lamp; in his left a glass of wine, which it appeared the deceased man had sent
                     him after.*
                     Albert fixed his eye on him and moved slowly toward him. The landlord was too
                     terrified to speak; his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth. He attempted to
                     move—to raise his hand—but it was in vain. Slowly Albert approached his
                     intended victim. His eyes did not wink, nor his hand tremble, even when he
                     raised the fatal knife. Like a bird fascinated by the snake, the landlord
                     suffered him to approach him. Albert gave him a blow in the breast and removed
                     his eyes. The charm was broken.
                  
                     *The landlord's wife stated to the Coroner that her husband was subject to fits, and that he always brought a glass of wine with him when he retired to his room. Many witnesses, who were acquainted with the landlord, stated the same. As but a few drops of wine were found, it is supposed that the murderers drank it.—M——g Tribune,
                     
                  
                  "Help! help! they murder me!" shouted the landlord. Repeatedly the assassin
                     plunged the knife into his body. Suddenly his cries ceased, his eyes closed,
                     and with a low moan he fell back—DEAD.
                  The work was done, and the murderer rose. The glass of wine was lying upon the
                     floor, and, strange to say, not a drop had been spilled. He stooped down and
                     emptied the glass of its contents.
                  "Let us escape," said Cornelius.
                  Albert threw open the window; it was but twelve feet from the ground. He leaped
                     out; his brother followed him. Hurriedly they made their way toward the stable.
                     Suddenly a huge dog sprang up and caught Albert by the throat. One blow with
                     his knife, and he was freed from this new enemy. The stable door was dashed
                     open and the horses brought out. It took but a few minutes to place the saddles
                     upon their backs. Hardly had they mounted them, when the door of the tavern was thrown open, and several men
                     came forth. By the light of the moon they beheld the brothers.
                  "Shoot them down!" shouted one of the men; and drawing a pistol from his belt
                     he fired. The ball passed through Cornelius' cap. Revenge prompted him to draw
                     a pistol and fire in return. The man sprang several feet into the air, and fell
                     dead.
                  "Forward!" shouted Albert; and pressing his spurs into the animal's side, he
                     leaped over the fence in gallant style. For an instant Cornelius' horse refused
                     the leap, but a sharp cut over the neck with his whip caused him to make
                     it.
                  "Follow them!" cried one of the men; and the two brothers had not proceeded
                     more than a mile, when they heard the sound of pursuing footsteps behind them.
                     Each drew up at the same instant, and each held a cocked pistol in his hand. As
                     they were standing in the shadow of a tree, the horsemen did not see them until
                     it was too late. The two brothers fired at the same instant, and two saddles
                     were empty. Then, again putting spurs into their horses' sides, they rode
                     swiftly forward.
                  When day broke, they had left the tavern far behind them.
                  Reader, tales of blood are hateful to us. Would that this story were merely a
                     fiction, but, alas! it is true, and we must give it as told to us by the
                     brothers. Young man, master your passions while young, it cannot be done when
                     old. Do not let your passions master you, but master them. Remember this.
                  On reaching the city of Bornton, the young men went to the first hotel in the
                     place, and ordered the finest apartments in the house to be placed at their
                     disposal. As they were afraid that their resemblance to each other would betray
                     them, they bought false beards, wigs, &c.; and also ordered the landlord to
                     send for Mr. H—, the merchant tailor. As soon as he came, they ordered him to
                     measure them for several suits of clothes. They gave a short account of
                     themselves to the landlord, in which they stated that they were cousins, and
                     that their father had sent them to the city to inquire after an uncle by the
                     name of Martyn. The landlord brought them a directory, and on opening it, they
                     found that several persons in the city were named Martyn. They requested the
                     landlord to send their meals up in their rooms, as they were bashful, and were
                     not used to dining in a hotel. They also stated that they wished to sell their
                     horses, and that they would let them go out of their hands for one half their
                     value. The landlord, who suspected nothing, offered to purchase them, and to
                     pay for them in cash, one thousand dollars. Albert saw a sprightly young negro
                     boy playing about the floor, and he offered the landlord two hundred dollars
                     for him. After a little wrangling about the price, the landlord consented, and
                     Albert paid him in counterfeit money.
                  As soon as their clothes were finished, they purchased tickets for New York,
                     and having entered the cars, they were soon on their way to that far-famed
                     city.
                  It was several weeks after their departure before the landlord discovered that
                     the money he had received from them was worthless. He raved and stormed, but it
                     was of no use. He offered a large reward for their arrest, but years passed
                     before he saw them again.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  NEW YORK—THE TWIN BROTHERS LOSE THEIR MONEY—THE INVITATION—THE
                     BALL ROOM—PICKING POCKETS—THE LOAN—THE BRACELET—THE BREASTPIN—THE DISCOVERY—THE
                     ALARM—HOUSE BURNING—THE ESCAPE.
                  New York City! Great thou art in riches, great thou art in crime. Many a young
                     man hast thou ruined, many a felon hast thou made. Well worthy thou art of
                     being called the "Empire City," for an empire thou art in crime and
                     wretchedness.
                  It was noon when the twin brothers reached New York. They were astonished at
                     everything they saw; but as soon as they had somewhat recovered, they ordered a
                     cab and were driven to the Astor House. On reaching it, they gave out that they
                     were British noblemen, traveling for health and pleasure. Before night had
                     drawn her curtain over the sky, numberless cards and invitations had been
                     received. The two brothers were overjoyed at their success.
                  "All goes well," said Albert. "That was a good thought of yours, the making out
                     that we are lords. At any rate, we have more money than most lords have."
                  "Let us visit the theatre," said Cornelius.
                  "With pleasure. Waiter, call a carriage."
                  A carriage was called and the two men stepped in. In an hour they reached the
                     theatre. Neither of them had ever visited a place of amusement before. They
                     were astonished at the large number of lights, and the splendor of the stage.
                     The play was Macbeth, one of the most thrilling tragedies of the immortal
                     Shakspeare. During the performance of the piece, Cornelius' agitation was
                     excessive. When Macbeth made his exit to murder the king, it reminded him so
                     forcibly of the murder of Demmon, that he was obliged to leave the theatre and
                     return to the hotel.
                  The next day they removed to a private house. That same evening they again
                     visited the theatre, and when they returned, they found that their house had
                     caught fire during their absence, and that nothing remained but a heap of
                     smoking ruins. Unfortunately, they had left their money in their trunks, and,
                     of course, it had been burned.
                  "Altogether we have but fifteen dollars," said Albert, "and that, in a city
                     like this, will last us but a few days."
                  "What are we to do?" asked Cornelius.
                  Before Albert could reply, he felt a touch on the shoulder which caused him to
                     turn round.
                  "What do you want with me?" he asked, of a man who was dressed in livery.
                  "Please, sir," said the man, with a low bow, and holding up a gilt-edged note,
                     "my mistress told me to deliver this 'ere note to Lord Stanhope. Be that your
                     name?"
                  "Yes."
                  Albert took the note, and breaking open the seal he read it. A smile passed
                     over his features.
                  "I will be there," he said to the servant, who immediately left him, after
                     bowing several times.
                  "What is it?" asked his brother.
                  "Merely a note to attend a fashionable party this evening," said Albert
                     carelessly. "It may be the means of putting money in our pockets," he
                     added.
                  That evening a carriage was ordered, and the two brothers entered it. In an
                     hour they stopped before a large and handsome mansion on F—h avenue. Albert
                     rung the bell, and the same servant who had handed them the note in the morning
                     came to the door. On seeing them, he bowed to the floor, and bade them enter.
                     When they had done so, he closed the door and led the way up a wide pair of
                     stairs to the second story. Then, throwing open a door, he cried in a loud
                     voice, "Lord Stanhope and his brother!"
                  The room was filled with ladies and gentlemen, all of them dressed in the most
                     fashionable style. On hearing the name, several of them made a rush toward the
                     door. Among them was a lady of the most commanding beauty.
                  "Back!" she exclaimed, waving her hand with the air of a queen. "Welcome, my
                     lord. Make way there for Lord Stanhope;" and taking both their arms, she led
                     them to the middle of the room.
                  "You are Mrs. M——d?" said Albert, interrogatively.
                  The lady bowed.
                  "I have heard of your arrival and the destruction of your house by fire," she
                     said, "and, as you are a stranger in a strange land, I could do no better than
                     to invite you to my house."
                  Albert smiled.
                  "How like they are to each other," said a young lady, in not so low a tone but
                     that Albert heard her.
                  "This is Miss M——d, my daughter."
                  Albert bowed; and as the music was striking up, he requested the honor of her
                     hand for the next dance, which happened to be a waltz. She graciously
                     consented. While they were dancing, Albert observed that she wore a very
                     beautiful gold watch.
                  "I may as well begin my career as a pickpocket here;" he muttered to himself;
                     and watching his opportunity, he drew the watch from her neck without being
                     observed by any one. Soon the dance was ended, and both seated themselves.
                  "How do you like the country?" said Miss M——d, who wished to engage him in
                     conversation.
                  "Very well, considering the short time I have been in it," was the reply; and
                     he fixed his fine dark eye on her face. It was then that he noticed that she
                     was very beautiful.
                  "How long do you intend to remain here?" she asked.
                  
                  "I did intend to remain here a year, but I lost all my money and drafts by the
                     fire last evening, and I must return to England for more."
                  The young lady blushed slightly as she said,
                  "My mother will lend you money to any amount."
                  "Just as I expected," said Albert to himself; "but," he added aloud, "I am a
                     stranger to your mother, she knows me only by name."
                  "That will make no difference," said the young lady.
                  "Really, my lord," said a fine, matronly looking woman, approaching, "you
                     occupy yourself too much with Miss M——d."
                  "Excuse me," said Albert, with a smile, and rising; "her conversation was so
                     interesting that I quite forgot myself," and he made a low bow.
                  As to Miss M——d, she looked daggers at the lady, who returned her look with a
                     smile. Albert noticed it, and his heart beat with joy.
                  "Let me introduce you to my niece, Miss Anna H——; Anna, this is Lord
                     Stanhope."
                  The young lady rose.
                  "Be seated," said Albert, seating himself in a chair by her side. They had not
                     conversed long when the mistress of the house approached.
                  "I wish to speak with you in private, my lord," she said.
                  Albert rose from his chair, and walked with her to an inner room.
                  "You had a short conversation with my daughter a few minutes ago," she said.
                     "You lost all your money by fire last evening. Oblige me by accepting this. It
                     is a check for five thousand dollars."
                  "How can I thank you for this unexpected kindness?" said Albert, as he placed
                     the check in his pocket-book.
                  "By saying nothing about it," replied the lady.
                  "Madam, the generosity of the Americans is proverbial all over the world," said
                     Albert, "but little—"
                  The lady covered his mouth with her hand.
                  "No thanks," she said with a smile. "You can repay me when I visit
                     England."
                  "Ah! then you must visit my castle," said Albert. "I shall have great pleasure
                     in showing you over London."
                  "Your arm," said the lady as she opened the door. "What do you think of our
                     American ladies?"
                  "I think they are very beautiful," said Albert; "and, moreover," he added, as
                     he subtracted a splendid bracelet from her arm, "I think they have a great
                     taste for jewelry."
                  "You flatter us," said the lady, smiling.
                  "Upon my honor, no," said Albert. "My words come from the heart."
                  At this moment a short, pompous looking gentleman came up. His clothes, though
                     fashionable, sat awkwardly upon him, and he had that nervous air belonging to
                     persons who are not used to good society. On his fingers he wore several
                     magnificent rings, and in the bosom of his shirt was a splendid diamond
                     breastpin.
                  "This is my husband, Mr. M——d," said the lady. "This is Lord Stanhope, my
                     dear."
                  "Very much delighted to see you, my lord," said Mr. M——d, extending his hand,
                     and speaking in a hurried manner, as though he wished to get over the form of
                     introduction as soon as possible. "Bad affair, that of your house;—very
                     sorry—wife could speak of nothing else all day long."
                  "How proud I am to make your acquaintance," said Albert, laying his hand on his
                     neck. This appeared to delight the other extremely, so much so that Albert
                     managed to slip the breastpin from his shirt, and put it in his pocket.
                  "Excuse me a moment," said Albert, "I wish to speak with my brother;" and he
                     left them. Cornelius was standing near a window, conversing with Miss M——d.
                     Albert approached him, and made a sign that he wished to speak with him.
                  "Have you done anything?" he asked.
                  "Yes," replied his brother—"three gold watches."
                  "Good; we are getting along famously," said Albert. "We are worth at least ten
                     thousand dollars now. What a handsome breastpin your partner has got."
                  Cornelius took the hint.
                  "I will get it," he said. "Let us separate: see how the people are eyeing
                     us."
                  Albert again approached Mr. M——d and entered into conversation with him. Soon
                     he managed to ease him of his watch.
                  "Is it not supper time, my dear?" said Mrs. M——d.
                  Mr. M——d put his hand in his vest pocket to feel for his watch, but it was not
                     there. At the same instant he heard his daughter's voice exclaiming,
                  "My watch is gone. Somebody's took my watch."
                  "D—n me!" exclaimed Mr. M——d, "if I know where my watch is gone to."
                  "My bracelet!" cried Mrs. M——d; "I've lost my bracelet!"
                  Albert thrust his hand into his pocket.
                  "Somebody's picked my pocket!" he exclaimed.
                  "And mine!" cried his brother.
                  Mr. M——d sprang to the door, and leaned with his back against it.
                  "No one shall leave this house without being searched!" he exclaimed.
                  Albert turned pale, but he still retained his self-possession. He sprang to Mr.
                     M——d's side. Cornelius managed to slip through a side door into the hall.
                     Knowing that everything depended upon himself, he entered the ladies'
                     dressing-room, and seizing a lamp, he set fire to the curtains. In an instant
                     the room was filled with smoke, which passed through the hall into the
                     ball-room.
                  "Fire! fire! the house is on fire!"
                  The ladies screamed, and several of them fainted. Several of the gentlemen
                     opened the window and leaped out. As to Albert and his brother, they showed
                     their agility by leaping through the window, and running up the street. A cab
                     was passing by; they hailed it and sprang in.
                  "Where to?" asked the driver.
                  "The Astor House."
                  In an hour they reached it.
                  "We must leave this city as soon as possible," said Albert. "How did the house
                     catch fire?"
                  "I fired it," replied his brother.
                  "It was well done—just in the nick of time, too. I hope the house is insured:"
                     and he laughed heartily.
                  "Do you intend to visit Saratoga?" asked Cornelius.
                  "Yes," replied Albert. "We will take the cars for that place to-morrow. Let us
                     go to bed. Good night."
                  The next morning they were en route for
                     Saratoga.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  SARATOGA—THE SPRINGS—THE COTTON PLANTER—THIRTY THOUSAND
                     DOLLARS—THE ATTEMPT—THE FAILURE—THE MURDER—THE DISCOVERY—HARRIET C.—THE
                     SEDUCED—THE DUEL—THE DEPARTURE—THE DISGUISE.
                  In ten hours they reached Saratoga. The hotels were all crowded, but a few
                     extra dollars secured them rooms at the United States hotel—the largest hotel
                     in the place. Although somewhat fatigued, their curiosity to see the springs
                     was so great that they resolved to visit them that evening. Accordingly, as
                     soon as they had finished their supper they walked down Broadway to the
                     Congress spring. After drinking several glasses of the water, they walked to
                     the Indian encampment at the lower end of the village. Then they visited the
                     Iodine spring, the Empire spring, the Putnam spring, &c., and then visited
                     the Pavilion theatre situated in front of the Pavilion spring. Then, feeling
                     somewhat tired, they returned to their hotel.
                  The next morning the rain poured down in torrents, and this, of course,
                     confined them to the house. Albert entered into conversation with a young man,
                     and discovered that he was the son of a wealthy planter in Georgia. His father
                     had sent him to the North to purchase railroad stock—some thirty thousand
                     dollars worth—and he had the money in his pocket. Albert's eye watered on
                     hearing this, and he resolved that the money should change hands. At noon the
                     rain ceased, and Albert invited the young man to go with him to the Indian
                     encampment. He consented, and in company with Cornelius they set out. After
                     remaining a short time at the encampment, they walked toward the open country.
                     Soon they had left the village several miles behind them. Albert looked around
                     him. No one was in sight. Cornelius engaged the young man in conversation,
                     while Albert, watching his opportunity, thrust his hand in his pocket and drew
                     forth a well 
                        fillen
                        filled
                      pocket-book. Before he could thrust it into his pocket the young man
                     turned round, and seeing his pocket-book in Albert's hand he drew a Bowie knife
                     and held it high above his head.
                  
                  
                     
                  
                  "Would you rob me?" he exclaimed. "Return me my pocket-book."
                  "Take it; I was merely joking," said Albert, throwing the pocket-book on the
                     ground; and, as the young man stooped to pick it up, he caught him by the hair,
                     and twisted the knife from his hands. Then, before he could utter a cry, he
                     drew the knife across his throat with such swiftness, that it completely
                     severed the head from the body.
                  "It is done," were the murderer's first words.
                  "Yes! it is done, and retribution has yet to come!" shouted a voice near them;
                     and a man on horseback dashed past them. For an instant their eyes met, but
                     that one instant served to engrave his features on the murderer's heart.
                  "Let us leave the place," he said, as soon as the man had disappeared.
                  That evening they left the village and journeyed toward Montreal. The next
                     morning they reached it.
                  Reader, it is not our intention to detail all their adventures. Even if we
                     wished it, our pen would refuse it. Our soul is already sick at the many scenes
                     of horror we have been obliged to delineate. Would to heaven that the work were
                     merely a fiction, but alas! it is not.
                  In Montreal, Cornelius made the acquaintance of a young lady by the name of
                     Harriet C——. Under a promise of marriage he seduced her; and, in a few weeks,
                     growing tired of her, he gave her fifty dollars and set her adrift upon the
                     wide world. Her brother, hearing of it, challenged Cornelius, and a duel was
                     the consequence. They met, and the young man fell. As there were some
                     suspicions of foul play, the brothers were obliged to leave the city. In two
                     weeks they landed in Boston. They remained there but a few days, and then set
                     out for Murrell's Mountain. To reach it they were obliged to pass through the
                     city in which they had committed their first murder. In order to do this
                     without being discovered, they disguised themselves so effectually that even
                     their nearest friends would not have known them if they had met with them.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE NEIGHBOR—A TALE OF HORROR—PHILIPS AND JOHN A. MURRELL ONE AND
                     THE SAME PERSON—THE OATH OF VENGEANCE—THE GAMBLER—THE MURDER—THE TERRIBLE
                     DISCOVERY—THE FIRE—THE ESCAPE.
                  On entering the city their first thought was a visit to their sister Ellen.
                     Accordingly they rode over to her house, but to their astonishment they
                     discovered that she was not there—that the house was empty and destitute of
                     furniture. A lady in the next house who saw them, beckoned to them, and as they
                     entered her room she asked,
                  "Are you looking for Miss Ellen Eganas?"
                  "Yes," replied Albert, "she is my cousin, and I wish to see her very much. Can
                     you tell me where she has gone to?"
                  The lady requested the two brothers to be seated, and then informed them that
                     Ellen's two brothers had murdered a man and fled the city. That a few days
                     after they had left, a man who appeared to be a minister called at her house,
                     and stated that her brothers had sent him to take care of her. That he took her
                     to balls and places of amusement, and under a solemn promise of marriage
                     seduced her. That in a few weeks he abused her, and to escape him Ellen fled
                     with a gentleman she was well acquainted with, and who was one of the richest
                     men in the city; and that was all she knew about her.
                  "But this clergyman—his name?" asked Albert.
                  "Philips."
                  Albert grasped his brother's arm and dragged him into the next house.
                  "Brother," he murmured in a hoarse voice, while a strange light beamed from his
                     eye, "know you not that Philips and John A. Murrell are one and the same
                     person?"
                  "My God! can it be possible?"
                  "It is more than possible—it is true. Cursed be the arm that struck my sister
                     low. But I will avenge her;" and he took a fearful oath. "Aye! I swear to
                     follow him, if need be, to the end of the earth, and wreak my vengeance on him.
                     Murrell, beware, a bloodhound is upon your track. You have escaped the
                     officers; you cannot escape him."
                  
                  That evening they left the city and proceeded to the mountain. On reaching it,
                     Albert gave the password and entered the cave. It was crowded as before; but
                     Murrell was not there. The members gave them all the signs and passwords; and
                     one of them who acted as captain when Murrell was absent, gave them a large sum
                     in counterfeit money. After waiting several hours they left the cave. For three
                     months they remained in the city, hoping to hear from their sister Ellen, but
                     she did not appear. Albert forged a check for ten thousand dollars on a rich
                     merchant and got it cashed. At length, growing tired of the city, they left it
                     and proceeded south. On their way they stole several horses and negroes, and
                     sold them for a large sum in New Orleans. The brothers were men no longer; they
                     were fiends—devils in human shape. Well worthy were they of belonging to the
                     dreaded Banditti of the West."
                  On reaching New Orleans they lost all their money at the gambling table. Albert
                     discovered that one of the gamblers lived in a house near the levee. He also
                     discovered that he was worth several hundred thousand dollars, and that he kept
                     the enormous amount in an iron box under his bed. He resolved to enter the
                     house that evening, to kill the gambler, and to make off with the money.
                  That night both brothers armed themselves, and set out for the gambler's house.
                     It required but a few minutes for them to cut a pane from the window and crawl
                     in. Albert carried a dark lantern in his pocket, but he did not light it. They
                     drew off their boots and mounted the stairs. Each carried his Bowie knife in
                     his hand. Soon they reached the top of the stairs. Then, feeling their way
                     along the wall, they stepped lightly forward! Soon they reached a door. They
                     softly opened it and entered. The moon cast a dim light through the window into
                     the room. They saw the gambler lying on the bed, and by his side a female.
                     Albert stepped lightly across the room, and raising his knife, he aimed a
                     tremendous blow at his breast. At that instant the gambler stirred, and the
                     knife passed through the bed-clothes into the wood. The shock jarred the bed
                     with such force that it awoke the gambler. He saw a dark figure standing at his
                     bedside, holding an uplifted knife in his hand. The gambler comprehended all.
                     Thrusting his hand beneath the pillow, he drew a large Bowie knife, and made a
                     thrust at Albert with it. Albert sprang one side, and before the other could
                     again raise the knife, he brought his own with terrible force on his head. With
                     a groan the gambler sank back. At the same instant the female uttered a cry for
                     help. "Strike her!" cried Albert, thrusting his hand over her mouth. His
                     brother made a pass at her with his knife, but the blade missed its object and
                     buried itself among the bed-clothes. Again Cornelius raised the knife, and this
                     time the blade passed through her heart. Albert drew the dark lantern from his
                     pocket, and throwing up the side he lit it.
                  "Let us see who the female is," he said, and he turned the lamp upon her face.
                     He had hardly done so when he uttered a piercing cry, dropped the lantern, and
                     staggered back.
                  "Gracious God!" he exclaimed in a voice of horror—"we have murdered our
                     sister!" and he covered his face with his hands.
                  Oh man! man! well may you say, "Crime meets with its own reward." God has
                     punished you. No more shalt thou be happy. Thy career of crime is almost over.
                     A few days more and thou shalt perish on the gallows.
                  When Albert raised his head, he discovered that the lantern had set fire to the
                     bed. His brother was gazing on the corpse with an expression of terror. Albert
                     was the first to recover from his astonishment.
                  "Come," said he, laying his hand on his shoulder, and speaking in a husky
                     voice, "let us leave the house."
                  Cornelius drew a flask of brandy from his pocket, and passed the contents down
                     his throat.
                  "Shall we take the money with us?" asked Albert.
                  "No!" almost screamed his brother; "it would burn my fingers; 't is made of my
                     sister's blood."
                  A wild light gleamed from his eye as he spoke.
                  "Fire! fire!" shouted a voice from the street.
                  "Let us leave the place," said Albert; "quick, or we shall be discovered."
                  They left the house without being discovered, and without taking the money with
                     them.
                  Three days afterward, and they landed at S——h, Ga.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  THE TWO RUSSIAN NOBLEMEN—GAMBLING—THE DISCOVERY—THE MURDERED
                     BROTHER—THE ARREST—ANOTHER DISCOVERY—THE STRANGER—THE LANDLORD—THE WIFE—"MURDER
                     WILL OUT"—THE PRAYER—THE PRISON.
                  At S——h they gave out that they were two Russian noblemen. As usual in such
                     cases, the aristocracy of the city sent them numerous cards, and invitations to
                     attend balls, parties, etc. Of course the brothers took advantage of this, and
                     not a day passed without bringing them a large amount of money. As fast as they
                     made money they gambled it away. They did not care whether they won or lost;
                     they gambled for the mere intoxication it produces. Often they would sit down
                     and gamble away fifty or even a hundred thousand dollars, and then rise and
                     leave the table with a smile.
                  Soon it was rumored through the city that the brothers were worth fifty or
                     sixty millions of roubles. Invitations poured in upon them. They strove to
                     forget their murdered sister, but it was in vain. She was ever before them.
                     Conscience, that still, small voice, troubled them, and remorse was gnawing at
                     their hearts.
                  One evening the brothers received an invitation to attend a ball. They went.
                     The rooms were crowded with the beauty and the elite of the city. All crowded around the two Russian noblemen,
                     and many were the toasts drunk to their health. Albert's partner was a handsome
                     young lady, the daughter of a wealthy cotton planter. As soon as the dance was
                     over, Albert led her to a sofa, and seated himself by her side.
                  "Dis be a ver fine cite," he said, in broken English.
                  "You should visit our watering places," said the young lady.
                  At this moment a gentleman came up and introduced the Russian embassador.
                  "Speak to me in de English tongue," said Albert, smiling. I no speak my native
                     language dis night. I be an American dis night."
                  The gentleman suspected nothing and after a short conversation, he left him.
                     Suddenly the music struck up.
                  "Will you dance?" asked the young lady.
                  "No; I feel ver tire," replied Albert; and he gazed around the room. Suddenly
                     his eye fell on a face that had haunted him for years. It was the man who had
                     witnessed the murder of the planter's son at Saratoga. At the same instant the
                     man's eye met his, and he made a movement of surprise. Without a word, he
                     turned and left the room.
                  "He did not recognize me," said Albert to himself.
                  "Look at your brother," said the young lady, pointing to Cornelius, who was
                     staggering about the room.
                  "He be vat you call inebriated," said Albert. "Vere you live?"
                  "In the city;" and she handed him a card.
                  "You got a brother?"
                  "I had a brother once," said the young lady in a mournful tone.
                  "Vere is he?" asked Albert.
                  "Dead," replied the young lady, raising her handkerchief to her eyes. He was
                     murdered."
                  "Murdered!" repeated Albert, slightly starting; "where? where?"
                  "At Saratoga—three years ago."
                  Albert sprang from his chair, and darted to the window, which he threw
                     open.
                  "Oh God," he muttered, "thy vengeance is pursuing me."
                  At this moment the door opened, and several police officers entered. They were
                     followed by the stranger.
                  "Where is he?" asked one of the officers.
                  "There," said the stranger, pointing with his finger to Albert.
                  One of the officers approached him.
                  "In the name of the law, we arrest you for the murder of Henry——at Saratoga,
                     three years ago."
                  "Arrest that man also," said the stranger, pointing to Cornelius. Several of
                     the officers sprang toward him.
                  "It was I that done the deed!" shouted Cornelius, as he leaned against the
                     wall. "Back! back! thou gory phantom!" he exclaimed. "Art thou returned from
                     the grave to pursue me?"
                  
                  "Arrest him!" shouted the stranger.
                  "Back!" cried Albert, drawing his Bowie knife. "The first man who approaches
                     me, dies."
                  "At him!" cried one of the officers. Several of them precipitated themselves
                     upon him, and in spite of his struggles, he was secured and bound. Cornelius
                     made no resistance, but suffered his arms to be bound behind him.
                  "There must be some mistake here," said the gentleman of the house.
                  There is none," said the stranger. "What his name is, I know not; but of this I
                     am certain, and that is, that he murdered Henry——at Saratoga."
                  "The proof!"
                  "My own eyes. I saw him do it."
                  Albert hung down his head.
                  "Hold up your head," said one of the officers. "Ho! he wears a wig, does he,"
                     he added; "and a false beard, too, as I live."
                  At this moment, one of the men passed through the crowd.
                  "If I am not mistaken," he said, "this is the man that passed a large sum of
                     counterfeit money on me several years ago. Yes, I am certain of it. I purchased
                     a pair of horses of him for one thousand dollars, and got no good out of them,
                     for they were stolen."
                  Another man pressed forward.
                  "I recognize this man," he said. "I knew him well in the city of C——e. He is
                     one of the far-famed twin brothers. He murdered Mr. W——r. His name is Albert B.
                     Eganas; the other is his brother, and his name is Cornelius D. Eganas."
                  "And I," said a woman, stepping forward, "recognize him as the murderer of
                     Charles Demmon, and of my husband, Nicholas D——."
                  Albert covered his face with his hands.
                  "Come," said the officer, laying his hand on his shoulder.
                  "Where?" asked Albert, faintly.
                  "To prison."
                  "God have mercy on me," he said, and fell senseless on the floor.
                  In an hour the brothers were lodged safely in prison.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  THE PRISON—THE TWIN BROTHERS—REPENTANCE NEVER TOO LATE—THE
                     EXECUTION.
                  A few days passed, when the brothers were brought out to the court house for
                     trial. They were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to be executed.
                  When taken back to prison, I visited them. Albert was lying on his bed, his
                     face covered with his hands. Cornelius, who appeared to be very ill, was lying
                     upon the floor. As I entered, Albert sprang up.
                  "What do you want here?" he asked, as though angry at being disturbed.
                  "To do God's work," I replied.
                  "God!" exclaimed Albert; "there is no God! I do not believe it! There is
                     none—none!"
                  "Wretched man," said I; "you do not believe in Him who is now punishing
                     you."
                  "Peace!" cried Albert. "I tell you there is none; and if there were, why did he
                     bring me here? Why did he make me what I am?"
                  "To bring——"
                  "Silence!" exclaimed Albert.
                  "I must do my duty," said I; and I seated myself upon the bed. With a curse
                     Albert sprang toward me, and raised his hand to strike. I folded my arms and
                     looked him calmly in the face. There was something in my eye that appalled him.
                     His uplifted hand fell, and he trembled violently.
                  "In a few hours you will be dead," said I.
                  "Why remind me of my condition?" cried Albert. "Is it to torment me that you
                     are here?"
                  "In a few hours," said I, "you will stand before your Maker."
                  Albert turned pale.
                  "Remember, unless you repent, you will be in a place of torment forever."
                     Albert extended his hand.
                  "Your mother—"
                  "My mother," said Albert, the tears dropping from his eyes as he spoke. "Man,
                     my mother's name has conquered me. Speak, and I will listen."
                  Long and earnestly I conversed with him. When I left him he appeared much
                     affected. He was on the road to repentance.
                  "God will thank you for this," he said; "I cannot."
                  That evening I again visited him. During my absence he had conversed with his
                     brother Cornelius, and had brought his mind to a sense of repentance. He gave
                     me a long account of his career in crime, beginning with the murder of W——r,
                     and ending with his last robbery. When he spoke of his sister Ellen, he wept. I
                     shuddered at the awful recital.
                  "Young man," said I, "your sins have been great, but not too great but that God
                     will forgive you. Pray to Him who hath said, repent, even if it be at the
                     eleventh hour, and I will forgive thee."
                  "I do repent," said Albert.
                  "And do you not fear death?" I asked.
                  "No; we wish to die," replied both.
                  After presenting each of them with a Bible, I left them.
                  The day on which they were to be executed came at last. I had remained with
                     them the whole preceding night. Both requested me to accompany them to the
                     scaffold. Soon the sheriff entered, and proceeded to bind their hands behind
                     them. As he appeared to be a little harsh to the prisoners, I requested him to
                     act as gently as possible. Soon the bell struck, and they were led forth. The
                     houses around the prison were crowded with people, who wished to view the
                     coming execution. I walked by the prisoners' sides, whispering words of
                     consolation in their ears. Soon we reached the scaffold. I offered Albert my
                     hand to lift him up the steps, but he refused it. Soon we stood on the
                     scaffold. For an instant Albert's eye wandered to the housetops, and then
                     around the prison yard till it rested on the scaffold. He shuddered slightly as
                     he beheld it, but it was not with fear, it was at the manner in which he was
                     about to die.
                  "If you have anything to say," said the sheriff, holding up his watch, "say it.
                     You have five minutes before you."
                  "I have only this to say," said Albert, stepping to the edge of the scaffold,
                     and slightly elevating his hand as he spoke: "I die guilty of all the crimes
                     which have been laid to my charge. May God have mercy on my soul."
                  "Have you anything to say?" asked the sheriff of Cornelius.
                  "Nothing, except that I die guilty of all the crimes which have been laid to my
                     charge. May God have mercy on my soul. Remember me, good people, in your
                     prayers to-night, and pray God to have mercy on me."
                  "Mr. Ransom," said Albert, "beneath the pillow of my bed you will find a
                     manuscript. Will you please publish it to the world, and show the young men the
                     rock on which I have fallen."
                  "I will," said I, much affected.
                  "God bless you," said Albert; and turning to the sheriff he added: "I am
                     ready." The sheriff placed the ropes around their necks, and seized the
                     axe.
                  "Adieu," said Albert.
                  "Adieu," echoed his brother.
                  The drop fell. For a moment they struggled in the air; the next, their
                     struggles ceased, and the twin brothers were dead.
                  God have mercy on their souls.

               THE TWO SISTERS.
               
                  
                     
                        "I mean to show things as they really are,
                        Not as they ought to be; for I avow
                        That till we see what's what in fact, we're far
                        From much improvement."
                     
                  
               
               
                  The above truthful lines, from Byron, exhibit the purpose of this work. It is
                     to aim at reform, by relying upon truth for our examples. Fiction may be
                     powerful, but we verily believe that one grain of truth is more fruitful of
                     good effects, than bushels of romance. A career of good, penned upon paper, may
                     sound well to the youthful aspirant; but when he tries to pursue the course
                     thus pointed out for him by the novelist, he finds himself pursuing a
                     will-o'-the-wisp, a chimera or bugbear. And very often the youth, ardent and
                     sanguine, and unused to defeat and discomfiture, turns away with a sick heart,
                     having in vain sought after good, upon the romancist's model; and then he may
                     fall into vice after vice, saying that there is no good, nor road to good, in
                     this sinful world. But take A. B., or C. D., for example, who are living in the
                     next street, and have accumulated wealth by industry, and established a good
                     name by their own honest efforts; and such a picture will establish more
                     solidity and purpose in the mind of a youth, than all the fanciful paintings of
                     the romancist's brain. Having faith in these views, we have selected two
                     characters—twin sisters; one of whom, it will be painfully remembered, was very
                     recently executed for the dreadful crime of murder; the other prematurely
                     finished a career of sin. And we shall show, in as graphic a manner as we are
                     competent of, consistent with the facts in the case, how, step by step, these
                     young and beautiful girls fell into the depths of wickedness and shame; so that
                     their lives, if of no use to themselves, may be productive of that result which
                     our great Maker designed, a warning, a reproof, and a lesson abounding in
                     wholesome, honest truths. In the course of these pages, we shall give some
                     scenes repulsive to the reader, as well as to ourself; but we are pledged
                     strictly to follow our text. We shall avoid everything which might sound
                     harshly upon the most fastidious ear. We shall not imitate the romancist, who
                     panders oftentimes to the passions and vitiated tastes of his readers. No, our little work shall contain
                     nothing which may be construed into licentiousness; but rather, all that may be
                     considered moral. We aspire to making our simple narration of these two young
                     girls, a class-book of truth, a companion book for young men, and a reference
                     of consequences for young women. We hope that it may be admitted to the
                     domestic fireside, and that the rich tones of the father may read it aloud to
                     his family; and that its fruits may be told in the righteousness of future
                     generations.
                  Once more we urge you to 
                        rememember
                        remember
                      that all herein contained is truth, "the whole truth, and nothing but
                     the truth;" and, in Eliza Cook's words, we speak to every youth in this vast
                     country: 
                        
                           "First, I would have thee cherish truth,
                           As leading star in virtue's train;
                           Folly may pass, nor tarnish youth,
                           But falsehood leaves a poison stain."
                        
                     
                  
                  And now, commending our humble efforts to pen the lives of two notorious
                     characters, teeming as they do with incident, to your lenient consideration;
                     hoping that our errors will be overlooked, in your appreciation of the aim we
                     have in view, to establish our literature upon a foundation of facts; to teach
                     morals from serious truths, and not from fiction;
                  
                     We remain, your obedient servant,
                     THE AUTHOR
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  PHILADELPHIA, on a light and brilliant day, when the dome of heaven is clothed
                     in blue, deeper in tint as it reaches to the far-off horizon, and bright and
                     clear o'er our heads, relieved by scattering clouds, that appear as golden
                     feathers along the sky; what a sight art thou! with one of thine arms resting
                     upon the heaving bosom of the delicious Delaware, and the other extending to
                     the serpentine Schuylkill, who revel in and partake of thy charms, and whose
                     unmatchable beauties contribute so much to thy fair fame, and envied position
                     among sister cities in the old and new worlds. Thine holiday charms, the
                     banners streaming from the house-top and the mast-head; the marches of
                     patriotic citizen soldiers upon thy proud streets; the rush of well-dressed and
                     handsome persons through thy midst; thine avenues, shading the passenger
                     luxuriously from the genial sun, by thy majestic groves; the echoes of luscious
                     music dying upon the ear; the pleasure steamboat, with its gay colors, and
                     still more gay and light-hearted passengers, who are off to the sylvan heights
                     of Florence, or to taste of the voluptuous scenery of Delaware's banks,
                     immortalized and beloved for having borne across her bosom the faithful
                     warriors of liberty; Newcastle rising to their eye from the western shore, and
                     fair Wilmington, too, with its modest grandeur, retiring down yonder creek,
                     shielding itself from the rude gaze, and yet contributing to the glory of
                     Delaware's scenery.
                  But to return. Gloucester, the hive of industry, the delicious village pedantly
                     named city, with its loom and shuttle music; and how does the glorious
                     Philadelphia look from this point? In solemn, quiet grandeur reposing upon the
                     mighty river; no hovels, nor misery, appears to the view; nor strife, nor
                     bustle, nor rush, nor shouting of voices, nor angry words greet our ear; but
                     one immense line of roofs, of steeples, of masts and tree-tops, stretching far
                     and wide; and as for noise, there is none—the city is, from the distance, a
                     necropolis, as noiseless and motionless as a vast burial place. But once
                     treading upon its docks, what angry looks, what anxious faces! how thousands
                     rush to and fro. Whither are they going? whence have they come? Barrels are
                     rolling in myriads on to a hundred vessels; goods in boxes and bales are piled
                     up, now dragged down, then rolled along. Here a rush of porters; there horses
                     dashing along, to the terror of squalling children and old age. Carts,
                     omnibuses, coaches, are dashing about with affrighted beasts and maddened Jehus. All is chaos,
                     confusion, noise, bustle. What a change to thy far-off quiet look, and
                     dead-like silence and inactivity. A ringing of bells; the roaring steam
                     deafening the shouts of the bawling captain; the noise of wheels, and the din
                     of commerce, make the sounds upon the ear almost amount to bewilderment. That
                     is Market street; the depot of commerce, the mart of trade, the focus of
                     enterprise. There is Chesnut street; the parade of beauty, the scene of
                     fashion, and the abode of luxury. Yon is Walnut street; a land of lawyers,
                     millionaires, idleness and woman. And each of these straight avenues, walled in
                     by red brick, contains some feature of the Quaker City's glory or shame. These
                     compact lanes, alleys and narrow streets, south of us, where houses are neither
                     brick nor stone, but old and crazy, of rotting lumber made, are filled with the
                     refuse of this civilized society; the ignorant, the pernicious, the lazy, the
                     drunken and the refractory. North of us lies the neighborhood whereto our steps
                     are now bent—S G. This majestic street, one of Philadelphia's broadest, is
                     tenanted by the sinew of the city, its middle class; the storekeeper, the
                     professional man, and the merchant; but all of second-rate power. This neat
                     residence, with its pretty red brick, and tasteful green blinds, and white
                     door, and marble steps, is the place where we shall rest the traveling
                     reader—at the residence of Mr. Stephen Y. L—.
                  The gentleman alluded to, sits in his easy chair, dandling upon his knee one of
                     his children, a young and beautiful girl of not exceeding nine years, who
                     crushes in her tiny hand his favorite newspaper, the Pennsylvania
                        Enquirer, a privilege in the way of destruction not even extended to
                     Mrs. L. Another girl, equally as beautiful, is teasing a small, barking lap-dog
                     on the rug; and Mrs. L— is very industriously employed in hemming a pocket
                     handkerchief, but occasionally directing the fond attention of the father to
                     the babes' playing. He is a man of some forty summers, while the mother has not
                     exceeded her thirty-fifth year. He is a tall, dark-complexioned man, tanned by
                     Atlantic suns, vigorous in frame, and intellectual in appearance; while she is
                     a light-complexioned woman, with auburn hair, blue eyes, full red cheeks, and
                     rich ripe lips, with a rounded, matronly form, still portraying symmetry and
                     grace in figure.
                  It is not essential, in our brief work of editing these lives, that we should
                     detail to our readers all the particulars of the studies, classes, and troubles
                     of the youthful sisters, from their cradle upward; nor any elaborate exposition
                     of the children's minds. Such a course would be tedious and unnecessary.
                     Suffice it to say, that they were of about the same size, each having blue eyes
                     and auburn hair. They were also, in all other respects, sisters and twins; and
                     all that distinguished them was a slightly different expression about the
                     mouth.
                  We will now leave the children to their tuition and training, while we engage
                     the reader with a brief synopsis of the lives of Mr. and Mrs. L—.
                  Matilda Weston, now Mrs. L— was the daughter of a wealthy farmer, of
                     Wilmington, in the state of Delaware. She became acquainted with her husband
                     from meeting him at a party, at a friend's of their parents, he, at that time,
                     being on a visit to that small and splendid city. He soon made proposals of
                     love to Matilda, which were accepted, and they became man and wife. But over
                     speculation in some mining operations reduced Mr. Weston, senior, to the lowest
                     state of dependence; till at length we find him, not alone stripped of his
                     estate, and incapable of contributing to the worldly comfort of his beloved
                     daughter, but obliged to become a recipient of the bounty of his son-in-law,
                     and a resident under their roof. This, with the old people's high notions of
                     independence, did not end happily; for Mr Weston died shortly after, and his
                     poor wife followed speedily. Mr. L— was a native of Scotland. He came to this
                     country at an early age, and got a situation as errand boy in a stock-broking
                     firm of Walnut street. Thence, through his acuteness, business tact, and fine
                     education, obtained under the most inauspicious circumstances, he was elevated
                     to a clerkship, and, at the time we find him, was a junior partner in the
                     house. It was simply a business partnership; L—, entering without any capital,
                     had to devote his labors for a mere moiety of the profits of the concern. Hence
                     it was quite as much as L— could accomplish, to keep up appearances, in the
                     eyes of the world, befitting his financiership. Not having received any
                     assistance from home or foreign sources, his position was much to his credit,
                     as an active, energetic, self-made man.
                  The twin sisters, as they grew up, developed great beauty, combined with rare
                     abilities, and became not alone the admiration of their parents, but a source
                     of conversation and admiration to all persons of refined taste, who chanced to
                     know them.
                  The firm with which Mr. L— was connected, became embarrassed, and its affairs
                     soon closed up, leaving Mr. Stephen L— burdened by debt, to commence battling
                     once more with the hard circumstances of city life. His integrity and
                     shrewdness soon won for him a situation of trust in another house of the same
                     character. But this, of course, was a serious blow to the laudable ambition of
                     leaving his daughters well provided for in his old age, or at his demise. But
                     his misfortune came heavily upon him, and, notwithstanding the advice and
                     retrenchments of his wife, it preyed sorely upon the man. Added to this, a fire
                     broke out in his residence, and left L— in the world, without a home. This,
                     with his previous troubles, and other embarrassments, led him, one morning, to
                     the committal of suicide. Mrs. L— had gone down to breakfast, at the hotel
                     where they were staying, leaving her husband in the act of shaving; when she
                     returned to his bed-room she found him weltering in his blood, with his throat
                     cut from ear to ear. For several days, the poor woman was crazed; but
                     recovering herself, she removed from her expensive quarters, and took up her
                     residence in the neighborhood of her first home in Philadelphia, occupying
                     cheap and decent apartments. She was obliged to withdraw her daughters from
                     school. They, by this time, were fifteen years of age, and certainly noble
                     girls; either, in stature, was above the middle height, of erect form, carriage
                     most queenly, and yet not verging into the pompous walk of pride. Their step
                     was light and aerial, as they tripped along upon the prettiest, neatest, and
                     yet plumpest little feet man ever delighted to look upon, or sculptor
                     transferred to marble. Their busts were not yet fully developed into womanly
                     fullness, but were most beautiful in their contour; their necks were
                     sufficiently long, and from the poll curved in the most graceful manner till it
                     formed the back; their shoulders shone with the gloss of semi-polished marble;
                     their arms were round, plump, pale, soft, and curved into two most tiny wrists,
                     and from thence their hands, so tender, with such gracefully long fingers, that tapered off, and
                     exhibited nails of filbert-like shape. Their faces were so much alike that it
                     is quite impossible to make a distinction, for no difference existed. When they
                     were together, it is true, Charlotte features were somewhat the larger, her
                     eyes a trifle the bigger, and her form, mayhap, rounder; but divided from each
                     other, it required the discriminating eye of one who was very familiar with the
                     fair gazelles, to make a difference; and indeed, while at school, they were
                     often taken for each other. The melody of their voices differed: not, indeed,
                     that they were either harsh; but Charlotte's partook slightly of the contralto
                     degree, while Helen's was a soprano. Their faces were of the oval shape,
                     surmounted by a brow of dazzling paleness, developing some intellectuality, but
                     not to that extent to make a strongly contrasted countenance. Their hair was so
                     soft and rich, so light and undulating, as it hung around their beauteous
                     temples, that it looked like locks of golden, rather than human hair. Their
                     eyebrows were arched as with the accuracy of an artist's skill; and their eyes,
                     so gentle, so expressive, like two mild orbs content to rest in their spheres,
                     and revel in the rest that the golden fringes afforded them. Then their cheeks,
                     so round, yet not fleshy; and upon these blushed two sweet pink roses; and
                     their mouths, so small and prettily shaped, opening upon a row of brilliant,
                     white, regular teeth; ears so pale, and when viewed from the profile, how
                     transparent. Indeed, their whole physical being seemed to be a combination of
                     nature's perfections. It looked as though they had been turned out of nature's
                     studio, better conceived and executed works than any hitherto. We have done
                     them injustice: 
                        "Those who paint them truest, praise them most."
                     
                  
                  The author being an unpoetical man, is sorry that he cannot realize upon paper
                     the twin sisters' charms; not that he has any immodest aim to serve, but their
                     beauty is the moral of this work, and well might we say of them, so love-like
                     were they, in the words of Byron— 
                        
                           "Whose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,
                           Would shake the saintship of an anchorite."
                        
                     
                  
                  But no more of this. We must dispel angelic charms, "to pursue the even tenor
                     of our way," among the features of our narrative.
                  Mrs. L——, upon the death of her husband, or as near after it as she could
                     command her energies, waited upon one of the principal tailoring
                     establishments, and procured work as an embroideress, upon vest patterns. As
                     her work was very superior to what they had been having, they gave her full
                     scope to introduce new patterns, which her genius enabled her fully to perform;
                     and thus she made from seven to eight dollars per week, while, as a worker upon
                     other tailor's work, she could not have earned over four dollars a week, by the
                     most intense labor. She then determined upon keeping Helen at home, to assist
                     her in her few household duties, and learn her business at her hands; while the
                     mother prudentially sought to give Charlotte another business, knowing that two
                     of a family often disagree, when engaged in precisely the same business. How
                     many brothers' love has this rivalry broken up? how many houses has it turned
                     into a scene of contention? So Mrs. L—— soon found employment, as a fancy
                     gaiter binder, for Charlotte.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  Mrs. L——, in a few months more, became reconciled to the loss of he husband,
                     and her work steadily improved; while her daughters continued each to earn some
                     four dollars weekly. Her situation, pecuniarily and mentally, was not so bad
                     after all. Their earnings, for the three, at all times, equaled fifteen dollars
                     weekly; and this, with the cautious hand of Mrs. L——, was made to contribute
                     largely to a respectable position, and necessary comforts. So that the twin
                     beauties were not destitute of the essential additions to good looks, in the
                     way of superior attire; and there were few girls that dressed like the
                     embroideress and the binder, to whom raiment lent so many charms, or, upon the
                     other hand, who made dress so becoming. Their choice of style was marked by a
                     fine eye for taste, elegance and neatness. While they desired to be
                     fashionable, it was not their aim to outdo fashion; but they never selected
                     anything for their wear, without a particular regard to its adaptability to
                     their order of beauty. This made their dress all the more becoming; while other
                     young ladies were spending much more money for clothing, they were making
                     themselves ridiculously outre, and robbed
                     themselves of that dignity which should attend a woman of taste. Having said
                     thus much, conceiving a useful lesson to be embodied therein, we shall
                     proceed.
                  Charlotte's employer was a man of some thirty-six years, a fine-looking
                     specimen of a gentleman; and, by his remarkable generosity, ingratiated himself
                     into the graces of the young ladies who worked for him, and by this means, and
                     his insinuating manners and polished address, succeeded in procuring the
                     downfall of many beautiful and gentle girls, to satisfy his own depraved
                     appetite. Charlotte, not being acquainted with the nefariousness of his designs
                     upon her, drank in all the gentle, but well-directed flatteries he plied her
                     with. His compliments were refined and even poetical, and his manner of
                     applying them so fanciful, and regulated by the bonds of etiquette, that they
                     could not fail to attract the admiration of a young, beautiful, and, of course,
                     somewhat vain girl of sixteen. He gave her the best work to do, and would
                     accompany that favor with another, of a superior price to what he paid the
                     other hands; so that Charlotte soon was earning five, and occasionally six
                     dollars weekly. He would often—accidentally, of course—meet her in various
                     places, when he would pay her the most decided attention; till at length, they
                     were upon terms of great intimacy, and Mr. Bellair, her employer, attended
                     Charlotte in her evening walks, at church, at private concerts; and Bellair may
                     be said to have introduced the young lady to "the world." At length he
                     overcame, by dint of perseverance, her mamma's scruples against balls and
                     theatres; and Miss L—— soon shone in the brilliant festive scene, at the feasts
                     of Terpsichore and Thespis. Her graceful manners and winning ways told, with
                     her beauty, in securing her many admirers; and flattery became pleasing to her
                     ear, and her thoughts became dazzled with the brilliancy and pride of her own
                     position.
                  
                  Bellair had now been acquainted with Charlotte six months, and by this time she
                     had assumed the manners of a most consummate coquette; she used her smiles for
                     wiles, and her charms to attract the notice of young gentlemen. When first on
                     the floor of a ball-room, she was frightened and dazzled, excited and
                     exhilarated, transported and retiring. But now, instead of cleaving to the arm
                     of Bellair, with the tenacity of a beautiful girl afraid of all around, she
                     would leave him so soon as she could perceive another acquaintance whom she
                     thought more available than her "chaperon." She could with complacency
                     criticize the arrangements, and find flaws in that music which she once
                     believed was more harmonious than any she had ever known. Her conversational
                     powers improved, or, we should say, deteriorated; for she could talk sprightly
                     things, appreciate good jokes, and beyond all her worldly accomplishments, she
                     was a most excellent whist player, a splendid singer, a faultless waltzer, a
                     perfect pianist, and a good player upon the guitar. All these contributed to
                     her attractions, and brought the young men buzzing, like bees around a flower.
                     She rewarded them equally, with smiles and tender looks, till Bellair felt
                     himself almost sorry for having taken the trouble to introduce one who thought
                     so little of him; or, at least, one whose affections he could not monopolize.
                     But when they were alone, she bent upon him her soft looks of affectionate
                     love, and Bellair forgot her faults. Indeed, we may say, that he retained more
                     of Charlotte's attention than any other mortal; but her heart was divided among
                     a hundred beaus.
                  Helen, brought up at home, under the strict surveillance of her parent, was not
                     so soon lost as Charlotte, and certainly displayed less of what the world calls
                     force of character. One morning Charlotte returned from a ball, and had her
                     sister locked in her arms, as she was recounting the adventures of the last
                     rout, and of her triumphs there, first asking her sister's opinion of which
                     young man she would most prefer, and then would follow an extatic description
                     of all her favorites; then came names, and she would repeat off a whole list of
                     names, asking her sister which she thought was romantic and pretty. Helen
                     interrupted her sister, by asking her opinion how the name, Gerald Vernon,
                     sounded.
                  "O, charmingly!" said Charlotte; and raising herself above her sister, and
                     reclining her splendid head upon her arm, continued she, "Why, do you know such
                     a one?"
                  "I do," said Helen, blushing deep carnation; "it's a pretty name, that's all,"
                     and she tried to draw her sister's attention off; but Charlotte remarked,
                  "A lover, I guess, Helen."
                  Her beautiful sister, finding herself cornered in her endeavor to conceal the
                     name of Vernon, remarked,
                  "Not exactly."
                  But Charlotte was not to be thrown off so easily. She kissed her sister, and
                     catching her luxurious locks, curled them around her taper fingers, and
                     said,
                  "Now, dear sister Helen, you do not use me well. I have told you all of my
                     affairs; every secret of my inmost heart. I have reposed many secrets in your
                     keeping, and have not asked even a pledge for their security; and you now have
                     some little love affair which you keep like a suspicious little miser, safely
                     locked up. O, it is too bad. At' least we ought to exchange civilities, or
                     withhold them altogether."
                  "Well, well, I believe you are right," said Helen; "but, Charlotte, I have kept
                     my secret from you, not from any desire to keep you uninformed of my actions,
                     but really because I felt you would laugh at me, and I almost entertain the
                     same opinion now;" and she covered her blushing face with her hands.
                  "Why, what's the matter with the girl?" said Charlotte, pulling her sister's
                     hands from her face. "Don't you think I know you must have a husband, and,
                     before that, lovers? Why, you are now seventeen years old, and it is not
                     unusual for girls to get married at that age. So now, dear Helen, tell me all
                     about it; how you became acquainted with your swain; what's the color of his
                     hair; who he is; what he is; and what he looks like, and all the other
                     information you can furnish. Come, be quick; I am dying with anxiety."
                  "Now, don't you laugh," said Helen, looking into her sister's face, smilingly.
                     "There, lay your head so;" and she took her sister's face, and turned it toward
                     the wall, and then said—
                  "Well; one night I was returning from: shop, and seeing some fountains play,
                     amid some majestic trees, enclosed by a splendid iron railing, I thought, as
                     the night was exceedingly warm, that it would be a delicious place to take a
                     promenade in, previous to returning home; and as I saw several other ladies,
                     and many gentlemen, seated and walking, it prompted me the more to join them;
                     and I went in accordingly, and sat upon, one of the seats, and enjoyed the
                     going down of the sun, the pleasant shade, and the music of the waters gushing
                     from the fountains; and when I went near to the falling waters, and felt the
                     cool spray dashing in my face, I was indeed happy. I saw a young man—O, so very
                     handsome!—observing me. I felt that he was about talking to me. I was much
                     afraid, so I hurried out of the enclosure, and looking up to the corner of the
                     street, as I was emerging from the portal, at one of its four corners, I read
                     the name—Washington Square. I then went home, and dared not turn round until I
                     reached our steps, which I hurried up, knocked at the door, and as I, askance,
                     cast my eyes, I beheld the figure of the young gentleman, who had followed me.
                     I slept uncomfortable, lest he might visit the house, now that he knew where I
                     resided. I went to the same place the very next night, as I had occasion to
                     visit the shop at about the same time on the ensuing day; and there was the
                     same gentleman, in precisely the same position, as upon the previous evening. I
                     did not know what to make of it. I was filled with curiosity. I staid a short
                     time, and returned; and as I approached the house, I turned round, and there
                     was my relentless tracker at my back. Well, I did not go to shop for five days,
                     and although this time elapsed, yet there I found my pursuer, ready to follow
                     me home when next I went to the square. In three nights after, I went again,
                     and the same scene was enacted over again. The next night, something occurred
                     which gave a change to the matter. I had taken my seat opposite to the
                     fountains; my gentlemanly pursuer was disposed of, I know not where, when, just
                     as I was returning home, a man, in age, I should guess, about twenty-eight,
                     with red hair saturated with grease, and a great fiery-looking beard, dressed
                     very gaudily, was parading very pompously around the
                      grounds, swinging a cane very swiftly. He seemed to me to be trying
                     an experiment, of how near he could bring it to one's face, without absolutely
                     striking you; and just as I turned round, he approached me, and lifting, in a
                     most ridiculous manner, his white hat from his head, scraped a kind of how to
                     me. I was lost in astonishment, and let down my veil to express my indignation
                     at his salute. Finding himself foiled in his attempt to force an acquaintance
                     upon me, he tried to complete his audacious effrontery, by saying, 'Why,
                     Martha, you surely do not forget me.' I could see what this was intended for;
                     to mislead the few spectators who had witnessed with pleasure the rebuff.
                     'Sir,' said I, almost crying, at being forced to hold direct converse with him,
                     'my name is not Martha, nor do I know you, never having seen you in my life
                     before,' and was proceeding upon my return homeward, when he caught hold of my
                     arm. 'Come,' said he, 'it's of no use; we 're old friends; what's the use of
                     enacting scenes for the gaping multitude; let's shake hands, and be friends.'
                     This was said with such an air of nonchalance, that I felt as though those who
                     had been witnesses of the scene would believe him, and I lost all confidence in
                     my ability to answer him with coolness, and I burst out into tears, and was
                     fast relieving myself of my heart-rending vexation. At this moment, my
                     mysterious pursuer suddenly emerged from somewhere, and said, in a rich manly
                     voice, to the fellow—'Pray, sir, do you strive to insult this lady?' 'No, sir,'
                     replied the rude fellow; 'she's an old flame of mine, and I don't want any of
                     your interference.' 'Sir,' replied my defender, 'I tell you to begone; you are
                     an impudent impostor; if not, I shall give you into the charge of the police;
                     or perhaps,' said my welcome friend, 'I shall take the law into my own hands,
                     and give you a sound thrashing.' Here the other grew mighty angry, and my
                     friend whispered to me—'Leave this fellow to me; I pray you, make quick home.'
                     I glided from the place, he following soon after; having disposed of my
                     intruder by breaking his fancy cane into a thousand splinters, and dashing them
                     in the red man's face, and quietly walking off, soon came up at the side of me;
                     and I must confess, since I have confessed so much, that I did not walk home so
                     quickly that night as hitherto. I thanked him for his gentlemanly conduct, and
                     expressed myself under never-ending obligations for his manly vindication of
                     myself in so marked a manner, and in so peculiar a contingency. He replied to
                     me, that he was proud to have rendered me a service. He was sorry that it was
                     under such disagreeable circumstances; lamented the occasion, and ended by
                     felicitating himself upon having an introduction to me, one he had watched with
                     so much attention. He then apologized for his rudeness, but excused himself in
                     a most sensible manner; but what he said, I entirely forget. However, as he was
                     a very splendid looking young man, I permitted him to walk home with me, and as
                     he took my hand, and asked permission to see mamma, I felt compelled, through
                     fear, to refuse him, but promised to meet him the next night; and then he
                     repeated, in a melodious voice, Watson's lines: 
                        
                           "But, O! whate'er my fate may be; 
                           And time alone that fate can tell;
                           May you be happy, blest, and free
                           From every ill Lady, farewell!'
                        
                     
                  
                  "I was charmed with the appropriateness of this quotation; his manners, his appearance, his chivalry. Of
                     course, I dreamed about him; and when the next night came, although I emerged
                     from my home conscious of having done wrong in not acquainting Ma with all that
                     had occurred, I went forth with a heart beating quickly, and with certain
                     emotions which it would be impossible for me to give expression to. He was
                     there. We passed a pleasant evening together. In form, he is of the middle
                     height, say five feet seven, to speak by rule. His hair is very black, very
                     glossy, and very curly. The form of his face is oval; his complexion the most
                     clear that you ever beheld on a man. His eyes are coal-black; his small, neatly
                     trimmed whiskers are also black, and a healthy color blooms upon either cheek.
                     His hands are small and well-shaped; and he is altogether a fine-looking young
                     man. I should say his age is not exceeding twenty-one. And now I have given you
                     a faint outline of my beaux; a young man to whom I am growing more and more
                     attached, and whom I am going to meet this evening again. But, hark! here's
                     Ma."
                  The door opens, and the mother enters; and, going to the bedside, she gives
                     each daughter a kiss, and embraces them.
                  "Well, my children," said she, "are you about to rise; it is near six,"
                  The beauties, in a few minutes, made their toilet, and each departed upon their
                     separate daily avocations. It was plain that the seeds of consumption,
                     engendered by over work, was fast reducing the vigorousness of Mrs. L——'s
                     constitution.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  Bellair still continued his favors toward Charlotte; and, notwithstanding her
                     coquetry and flirtation, she continued industriously at work. In fact, we might
                     say, that she was more inclined to work than before she was introduced to
                     society; for she found her expenses for dress increasing every day, and it
                     required an extra exertion, even at her high wages, to keep pace with the
                     increasing demands for wardrobe and jewelry. One day, Mr. Bellair, dressed in
                     his usual careful and genteel manner, waited upon the gentle charlotte, and
                     requested her to accompany him upon an excursion party to cape May.
                  It was a beautiful day; the party was a large and respectable one, and the ride
                     upon the majestic Delaware was most exhilarating and delicious. They remained
                     over night, and had a ball in the meantime. We should mention, that, as Bellair
                     sat beside the beauteous Charlotte, in a dark corner of the magnificent saloon
                     of the Kennebec, he placed around her neck a beautifully wrought Indian gold
                     chain, to which was attached a lady's beautiful watch, of most consummate skill
                     and workmanship. She was eloquent in her praises of his munificence, and in
                     expressions of admiration of his taste. As a return, she danced almost
                     exclusively with him during the whole night; and kept her eyes more than
                     usually fixed upon him. To keep the eyes of a coquette centred upon one man is
                     a work of so much difficulty that we are constrained to mention to
                     circumstance. She saw, We do not know how many Misters So-and-so, and
                     So-and-so, that she knew, and was in the practice of flirting with, but whom
                     to-night she scarcely noticed. The lights shone brilliantly in the crowded
                     ball-room of the principal hotel, and Bellair, encouraged by Charlotte's
                     preference for him, grew more and more familiar. She did not rebuke nor rebut
                     him. The young lady felt overcome by the heat, and proposed a walk; so they
                     left the magnificent scene of art for the more sublime work of nature, and
                     rambled in the garden at the rear of the building. The flowers had gone to
                     rest, and their beauties were not visible; but the moon, large and brilliant,
                     and the gorgeous sky, reveling in mountain upon mountain of light ether clouds,
                     was a study—a sight. Bellair conducted the splendid woman to the arbor, where
                     she drank in, with almost stupor-like reverence, the honey of his words; till
                     at last, after delivering a long rigmarole, he concluded by making her a base
                     proposal; at which she started to her feet, and, cast her eyes staringly upon
                     the base rascal, as if doubting what she had heard. He, of course, expected a
                     storm, and commenced wheedling her in a maudlin manner. But this was not
                     adapted to her present frame of mind. She wrenched the guard from her neck, and
                     throwing the bauble watch upon the ground, stamped upon it with ferocity and
                     madness.
                  "You base scoundrel! leave my sight. You miscreant! you wretch! you worse than
                     dog!" said she, straining her voice to an almost terrible height.
                  "For God's sake, speak lower!" urged Bellair.
                  "O, you ruffian! you wily wretch! begone, or I shall instantly have you put in
                     the hands of the police."
                  He entreated; but all Charlotte's answers were scorn. Then rushing upon her, he
                     put his hands over her mouth; and after a brief but desperate struggle, he gave
                     up his hopes of ruining Charlotte. She used invectives of the most desperate
                     character, betraying passionate indignation of no mean order. Her rage was like
                     the ocean; when calm, how placid, how gentle, how harmless, as on its broad and
                     polished face, it reflects the beauty of the sun; but when troubled, how
                     fearful, how desperate is it—a foaming, lashing, roaring, yawning gulph of
                     death and destruction. The more Bellair entreated, horror-stricken at the
                     tempest his vileness had raised, the more did Charlotte grow angry and violent,
                     as thought after thought rushed upon her fevered brain, and recalled in more
                     hideous characters the perfidy of Bellair's heart; till at length, overcome by
                     her excitement, she gave one loud, long, and piercing shriek, and fell lifeless
                     upon the sward. This brought persons but from the hotel; and coming to the
                     point from whence they heard the female cry of agony proceed, they discovered
                     Charlotte in hysterics, with Bellair vainly trying to restore her to sense and
                     life. A doctor being among the visitors to the hotel, soon came, and, by his
                     systematic mode of procedure, brought Charlotte back to reason and feeling. Her
                     very first words, upon her recovery, were—
                  "I desire to give this man, Bellair, into custody; he has used violence or the
                     meanest character toward me," said Charlotte, coolly.
                  "Why, the woman's mad," returned the astonished Bellair.
                  She did not heed his remark; but seeing no one willing to arrest him, said—
                  "Are there no gentlemen here, who will befriend a lady in distress, and see that her desire to preserve her
                     honor unsullied at the law's palladium, is fulfilled?"
                  This appeal soon brought the spectators to a sense of duty, and Bellair was in
                     the custody of a police officer in a few moments. Charlotte returned to
                     Philadelphia; but how differently to her coming out. Her excursion of pleasure
                     turned to a tour of woe. Bellair, who had come out a rich and respected man,
                     returned a prisoner, a victim to his passions, and a shame in the eyes of the
                     world.
                  When Mrs. L—— heard her daughter's story of her insult, she commended her
                     course, out mentally regretted her being thrown into the society of such
                     persons. Although she would not communicate her own views upon the subject,
                     from fear of annoying her daughter; yet she felt that her honor would have been
                     better preserved, had she quietly left the villain, than in bringing her case
                     into the open court of justice. This event added years to Mrs. L—'s
                     consumption.
                  At length, the case came on. The court was crowded even to suffocation; and
                     many of the most fashionable of Philadelphia society were present, and seemed
                     to hang with morbid interest upon the most disgusting features of the case. An
                     able counsel was engaged for Bellair; and he, in his vile cross-examinations,
                     hinted so much against Charlotte's character, as to leave the conviction in the
                     spectators' minds that the prosecutrix was a depraved and vitiated woman; and
                     when the young lady came from the stand where she had been giving her
                     testimony, she found her mother and sister in tears, and she herself became so
                     distressed, that she was borne from court in a fainting state. The court
                     reviewed the case, and charged the jury so strongly against the prisoner, as
                     left no doubt upon the jury's mind that the accused was guilty; and also
                     demonstrated to the public that the bench looked upon the cross-examination as
                     a foul slander upon the lady's character. Bellair was sentenced to one year's
                     imprisonment; and thus ended the first important scene in which Charlotte had
                     become an actress. Whether advantageous or not, the sequel will soon tell.
                  This case became the subject of much moment, comment, and small talk. The
                     newspapers dwelt upon it, with unctious love of exaggeration, and reveling in
                     its most disgusting features. Charlotte's beauty became more notorious than
                     ever; and when it was known that she had a sister, equally, if not more
                     beautiful than herself, it turned the heads of all the fine looking men, youth,
                     and dissipated roues of the city of brotherly love. And we know not how many
                     plots were immediately set on foot to entrap the twin sisters.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  Now turn we to the career of our sweet Helen. Every night that transpired found
                     her in the society of the young and noble-looking gentleman who had rendered
                     her so marked a service. This, added to his appearance, his lovable ways, his
                     intelligence, conversational tact, and general kindness, won the warm and
                     tender heart of the young lady. Love soon grew out of their acquaintance, which
                     seemed to be a mutual fire burning upon the altar of each other's heart. The
                     only alloy to her great joy was the fact that her acquaintance with Vernon was
                     conducted clandestinely to her mother. But still she dared not communicate to
                     her the news of her love; and this gave her much distress, for she loved to
                     make her mother's bosom the cabinet of her secrets. Gerald did not seek to be
                     introduced to the young lady's parent, but kept on in the pleasant task of
                     learning to woo her. And well and aptly did he learn it; for Helen's heart was
                     deposited in his; and her whole aim was to convince and assure him of his
                     entire possession of her love.
                  We shall now speak of Gerald; we have already spoken of him, as a man of fine
                     exterior, and of sterling capacities, we will now speak more distinctly of his
                     worldly position. Gerald Vernon was the son of a wealthy senator in the western
                     portion of the state, and resided at Harrisburg, the capital of the Keystone
                     State, who desired that Gerald, who had just finished his education, should
                     commence his studies in the office of a friend, a talented and highly reputable
                     Philadelphia lawyer. Gerald was a good scholar, learned in modern and ancient
                     languages, exhibited rare talents in historical lore, was a good mathematician,
                     and not an indifferent poet, as the files of Harrisburg papers will testify; he
                     was also a good musician, sang with taste, and danced very modestly, and
                     possessed an inimitable share of small talk interspersed with choice quotations
                     of the best ancient and modern authors. These qualities, handled with
                     judiciousness, tended to elevate Gerald into a very lofty being in the mind of
                     Helen. One night, (the very evening before that on which Charlotte had been
                     insulted by Bellair, in the garden of the hotel at Cape May,) as Helen lay with
                     her head resting upon the bosom of her lover, he was drinking in passion from
                     her lips, as they sat in the front room of a Camden hotel, and the girl's heart
                     beat high with love, and Gerald played most fantastic and soul stirring music
                     that enraptured, exhilarated and entranced the fair Helen, and she became a
                     victim to the wiles of the seducer. Helen soon after felt within herself the
                     wrong she had done, but told no one of her fall, not even her sister. Gerald
                     continued to pay her the same marked attention as usual, and she was
                     compensated for her misfortune by his smiles; but as yet she had not awakened
                     from her stupor of passionate love and blind devotion. The degradation, the
                     shame, and the contumely had not yet demonstrated itself to her mind. She never
                     calculated consequences—indeed she was ignorant of any, for she depended upon
                     Gerald's eternal love and devotion. At about this time, Charlotte revealed to
                     her mother and sister her insult, and intended destruction by Bellair; but
                     while Helen was pleased to hear of the escape of her sister, she never stopped
                     to compare her own situation, so wrapped up was she in a good opinion of her
                     lover. How blind is love, how well does this expression suit those who are
                     victims to the fascinating influence of passion. Here is one beautiful girl
                     fallen—immeasurably, irretrievably lost, who could not see her own shame, but
                     had a ready appreciation of her sister's less disagreeable situation. We often
                     perceive faults in others what we think talents in ourselves. The trial caused
                     considerable excitement among the small household, and scarcely any other
                     subject absorbed the notice of Mrs. L—— and her beauteous daughters for
                        several days. This matter of
                     Charlotte's produced a most melancholy effect upon the mind of her sensible
                     mother; for several months the poor woman found no rest from the disgusting
                     revelations which were made upon the day of trial, knowing as she did, what an
                     effect such aspersions—whether grounded or not—would have upon her daughter's
                     public character, she fretted more and more, until at last borne down beneath
                     the weight of this trouble, she took to her chamber and remained very sick
                     indeed for a few months. Mrs. L— had scarcely recovered from her last troubles,
                     when another still more serious came to blast her comforts, her hopes and
                     happiness; it was the news of Helen's advent to maternity.
                  One night when poor Helen's situation became imminent, and she could no longer
                     bear the suspense she had been thrown into, and when Vernon was no longer
                     regular in his visits, nor warm in his attachments as before, the girl poured
                     into the ear of her bedfellow and sister, a long tale of woe, of her fall and
                     perilous situation. Charlotte was overwhelmed with surprise, at the destruction
                     of one she had believed so unsullied and innocent. Notwithstanding Helen's
                     remonstrances and protestations to the contrary, Charlotte communicated the
                     whole matter to her mother, who was so overcome by the sad intelligence, that
                     she once more returned to her couch of sickness, and now that her consumption
                     had fairly settled upon her frame, she was no longer able to do her duty, and
                     remained an invalid. Helen was soon an invalid also from less honorable causes.
                     Charlotte's duties became onerous between the mother and sister's sickness.
                  One morning poor Mrs. L— requested to see Helen's baby. The woman was a wreck,
                     her full form had departed, the color from her cheeks had flown, the light of
                     her eye was dead, and she was now a hard breathing coughing, sighing,
                     debilitated candidate for a tomb. And when Charlotte showed her her sister's
                     child, the affectionate mother dropped a hot tear upon her fevered face, and
                     with her wan lips imprinted a feeble kiss upon the child of infamy, motioned
                     Charlotte to her side, who uttered a prayer, and then fetched her invalid
                     sister, who came just in time to kiss her poor mother's hand, and watch her
                     lips as they moved to and fro—but her gasping breath would give no utterance.
                     Charlotte and Helen knew it was a prayer, and they kneeled and prayed, and when
                     they looked up again into their mother's face, they saw that she was a
                     corpse.
                  Oh what a sight was here! The death-bed scene is always truly awful. Woe to her
                     or him who can look upon death with complacency. Such a calloused heart is not
                     worth the having. But here there was more than usual bitterness in the cup of
                     woe: not only was it the death of a mother, but it was the departure of the
                     only prop that supported the girls in this world, and without which they felt
                     they should be lost. And worst of all, oh dreadful thought! as one sister
                     looked upon the other, either felt themselves guilty of this death. Their
                     hearts beat with fear of having been a murderess, for they knew that their
                     parent's death had been hastened by their own imprudence, if not their crime.
                     Oh it was indeed a pitiable sight, there huddled together upon the floor, in
                     tortures of woe, bathed in tears, in agony of the bitterest grief—prey to
                     miserable dread—the two beautiful twin sisters. There upon the dead woman's
                     breast sat the little babe, innocent of all around, adding its shrill pipe to
                     the piercing cries of the prostrate daughters, little wotting of having earned
                     a miserable title for his future life, viz. illegitimate. There it struggled
                     unheeded, with "the helpless look of blooming infancy" upon him. 
                        
                           A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded,
                           A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded.
                        
                     
                  
                  And there at rest, with her soul winging itself to God's presence on high, to
                     render an account of her trust, herself, her daughters, lay the dead parent.
                     Ah, me! it was a grouping worthy of Pity's eye!
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  The funeral obsequies of the excellent Mrs. L— were conducted with decency and
                     due respect, and Charlotte and Helen appeared in mourning looking more lovely
                     in these robes of regard to departed worth than in the fashionable colors of
                     the time. They soon found that their united exertions were just competent to
                     maintain them in their present style of living. We should mention, also, that
                     Mr. Vernon now became a regular visiter to the house, and that the child was
                     given out to nurse to a respectable German woman living in Manayunk. As soon as
                     the season of grief was over, it was natural that the minds of the young ladies
                     should now return to the arrangements of their worldly difficulties. Charlotte
                     and Helen became more intimate than ever, and it was determined by them that
                     some steps should be taken to redeem the honor of Helen by marriage or
                     compensation. To this effect an interview was had between Vernon and the two
                     young ladies, in which Helen submitted the arrangement of her affairs to her
                     more worldly-minded sister. Since Helen became a mother, and from what her
                     sister had told her of the course she suspected her lover was about to take,
                     Helen no longer looked upon Vernon with that blind and implicit confidence that
                     she had done, so that she was perfectly calm and collected in the matter and
                     awaited the result with more stoicism than could be expected of her. Charlotte
                     asked Mr. Vernon his intentions toward her sister in a manner so decided that
                     he felt overwhelmed by the question. It was evident from his manner, that
                     Vernon never suspected such consequences, but had rocked himself in the cradle
                     of the hallucination of his great love, thinking that no notice would be taken
                     of the matter after the death of Mrs. L— he thought that the storm had passed,
                     but he soon found that what he had mistaken for it, were merely the dark and
                     threatening clouds which pass over our heads and indicate the bursting out of
                     the tempest with its pelting showers, forked lightnings, and cutting winds.
                     Vernon, vain deluded man, in an embarrassed manner said that he had made up his
                     mind to no particular course, indeed he had not thought any steps necessary.
                     Although this was said in an innocent manner, yet it tallied so well with what
                     Charlotte had told Helen, that the latter at once saw with redoubled force the
                     necessity of coming to decided action in the premises. The arbitratrix then asked the
                     gentleman whether he was blind enough to think that after he had reduced the
                     fair fame of a young lady, and made her charms subserve to his baser appetites,
                     and that a child should be born as the result of such unlimited confidence in
                     his honor, rather than as the results of any criminal desires upon the young
                     lady's part, that she should submit to becoming a mark of infamy, and allow him
                     to go forth unscathed and untouched to rob another home of its charms, to
                     despoil another fair flower, to pluck it from its natal tree, to gloat over its
                     hues and fragrance, and when his taste had been satiated with its beauties, to
                     throw it aside to wither, and die, to be trampled under foot by the ruthless
                     tread of the passer by. If he had so deluded himself with respect to her
                     sister, she assured Mr. Vernon that he was miserably mistaken. He then declared
                     that he had no such ideas, but the truth was that his love had come upon him
                     like a thunder clap, he was not prepared for it, but having by accident become
                     acquainted with the charming Helen, it was only to see her to love. Love and
                     passion conspired in his bosom, and he fell a victim himself, For he swore
                     before God that he never desired the name of seducer, but if any had told him
                     that such he would be, before the dreadful circumstance had taken place, he
                     would have branded that man as a liar. At the time that he became infatuated
                     with Helen's beauty, he said he was, pecuniarily, unprepared to love, being
                     only a student, without means; and he knew the temper of his parents too well,
                     to suppose that his father would allow him at his early age to marry. He showed
                     them clearly that his ruining of Helen was not a premeditated affair, that it
                     was the result of love and passion of youthful heart; he showed to them also
                     that he could not gain any thing by becoming a seducer; moreover that it would
                     be ridiculous to force him to marriage now, because such an union would be one
                     of misery, since he had not the first chance of supporting a wife—not even had
                     he finished his studies; he suggested that as his father would make him heir to
                     his splendid estate that they wait until the event of his demise.
                  Charlotte could not listen to this proposal. She remarked, that no matter how
                     dearly Gerald loved Helen now, it did not follow that that love would not be
                     replaced by some other at a future time. If not, it was scarcely likely that
                     Gerald, on coming to a large estate, and into an elevated position, would
                     proclaim himself to the public a seducer, by marrying the woman whom he had
                     dishonored, and, furthermore, to father a son who would be a reproach and a
                     shame to him. He protested; but Charlotte was not to be overcome. She desired
                     him to write to his father, asking for a larger allowance, on the grounds that
                     his present amount would not sustain him in that position which was essential
                     to his lineage and pretensions. He did so; and his father answered by making
                     some increase in his stipend, but not of sufficient amount to permit him to
                     contribute largely to his child and Helen's support. Now, Charlotte, after
                     this, felt that something must be done; and, having full permission from her
                     sister, she determined upon seeing Mr. Vernon, senior. It was a long time
                     before the affectionate Helen could be induced to sanction this step; but, as
                     her sister urged, they were but poor seamstresses, as they were; and were they,
                     because a man tried to crush them, to submit to his foot. "No!" said she. "We
                     can elevate ourselves pecuniarily from this, which will be some solace for your troubles;
                      for then we shall no longer have to
                     work the flesh off our fingers, and draw the eyes out from their sockets by
                     night-light, for the mere sustenance of life. We can at least go into society;
                     enjoy ourselves; and, who knows? instead of being workers here, we may elevate
                     ourselves to a lofty and dignified position in society."
                  Helen became less enamored of both Vernon and her position. Every day, more
                     acutely did she feel the pain of her disgrace, and her shame was vivid before
                     her; and being young, beautiful and captivating, she imbibed from her sister's
                     glowing account, a love for fashionable life. Upon this, Charlotte started for
                     Harrisburgh, and had an interview with Gerald's father. He was a very affable,
                     kind old gentleman, and became much taken up with her manners; but when he
                     heard the story, he was at first astonished, and seemed much distressed at his
                     son's behavior; but afterward, he called in his wife, and narrated to her the
                     circumstances. The poor lady was deeply affected. They gave Charlotte a
                     splendid suit of apartments, and desired her to await the arrival of Gerald; to
                     whom the honorable senator wrote a peremptory summons to return to his home by
                     the next train. The young gentleman was astonished at this strange and sudden
                     turn in his family affairs, and could not fathom the bottom of this matter. But
                     guess his surprise, when arrived at the domain of his parent; instead of the
                     happy emotional greeting he expected, he was received with marked coldness and
                     indifference by his sire, and with tears and anguish by his usually fond and
                     smiling mother. But this was not all; for, when he entered the drawing room, he
                     saw, what at the first view he took to be Helen; but the experienced eye of the
                     lover soon told him that it was Charlotte, and approaching her with all the
                     calmness he could possess, he shook hands with her. He immediately fathomed the
                     why and wherefore of this strange proceeding, and sat down with a very uneasy,
                     unenviable set of feelings, to hear the worst. His father, in a business-like
                     manner, and with more composure than could have been expected from him, related
                     all, asking him for his reply. It was brief and manly. He confessed all; tried
                     to palliate all, and begged his father to give his permission to his union with
                     Miss Helen L——, of whom he spoke in the most generous, affectionate and loving
                     terms. The father, determined to do nothing rashly, told Miss Charlotte that he
                     would be prepared to give her his answer on the ensuing morning. That came, and
                     with it his reply. He circumvented his decision with a fog of reasoning and
                     logic; but the main points in the arguments were, that he had decided upon
                     refusing permission for any union between the parties, for a thousand reasons,
                     which we will not befog our readers with a repetition of; however, he
                     determined to give her a compensation of five thousand dollars, which
                     Charlotte, who pretended to work for a marriage, very graciously accepted,
                     promising, upon the part of her sister, not to make any, further demand upon
                     either Mr. Vernon, senior, or junior's estate, and promising to prevent, by all
                     means in her power, the chances of Helen and Gerald's again meeting. Taking the
                     money in large bills, and after many civilities, she took her departure,
                     determined to spend with her sister a life of pleasure and gaiety. She returned
                     to Philadelphia, embraced her sister, who was delighted at the success of her
                     mission, and they slept in each other's arms, dreaming of the headlong career
                     of gaiety and fashion it was their determination at once to plunge into.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  As soon as the sisters could see a house, they commenced making arrangements
                     for removal. They furnished their neat and elegant residence in a very modest
                     and economical manner. It was situated at Kensington. Previous to making their
                     outlays, they placed their money in the bank, in order to cause it to be noised
                     abroad. Although neither of the sisters expected this small amount of money to
                     attract a millionaire, yet they knew that men rather court women with some
                     money, even if they do not require it, than poor beauties. This had the desired
                     effect; and, of course, the fact of the Misses L— having furnished a splendid
                     residence, and having five thousand dollars besides—for a story loses nothing
                     in the charge of Mistress Gossip—they were soon objects of observation, and
                     their great beauty filled the city with admiration. It will be remembered that
                     Charlotte's appearing in a public court, though it added nothing to her laurels
                     of virtue, contributed largely to her reputation as a beauty. They appeared at
                     all the balls, and Charlotte's wit and coquetry surrounded her with numberless
                     votaries; while Helen's debut in a more modest school, gave her a charm and a
                     name among the more retiring. They were soon the recipients of invitations from
                     the elite of the gay world; and brilliantly did the twin sisters shine in the
                     splendid saloon, and at the card table. In order to be well thought of, they
                     played cards for very high sums, and this, of course, attracted notice; but
                     while it did so, it was fast reducing their deposit at the bank to a mere
                     cypher. Among those who usually won was a young and splendid looking man named
                     Frank Paton; and this first attracted the notice of Helen, for Frank's manners
                     were pleasing to her, and it was only natural that she should watch, closely
                     and intently, the actions of a man of whom she had become somewhat enamoured,
                     and who paid her the most delicate attentions. Helen asked him the secret of
                     his success, and he at once disclosed it in perfect confidence. He said he had
                     commenced his career with a fortune of ten thousand dollars, and before he was
                     twenty-two years old, he was not worth a cent; he had lost it at the gaming
                     table. He afterward tried to follow an honest employment; but the infatuation
                     for gambling had taken so fast a hold upon him, that he could not shake it off,
                     notwithstanding that he used the most strenuous efforts to wean himself from
                     all play; till, one night, he perceived some unusual shuffling of the cards by
                     a player, and he at once saw that there was more in gambling than bringing
                     money to the table. He then made experiment after experiment with the cards,
                     until he could do almost what he pleased with them, and from that time his
                     success had been marked; he had never lost a cent
                      To show her what he meant, he first pulled from his pocket a couple
                     of sets of dice and boxes, which he said he always carried about him. He
                     further said that, on going into a room, if backgammon or dice should be
                     played, he would use his own dice, which, he demonstrated to her, were loaded,
                     so that they always dropped down with the lightest figures upon the face; that
                     is, they would roll out in such a way that they would count very lightly. "Now,
                     when I have to play, I use the regular dice, but, as you are aware, it is the
                     privilege of the opposite player to put the dice in the box; I then throw in my
                     dice, which I conceal in the palm of my hand, or in the sleeve of my coat, or
                     in my pantaloons pocket, and perform this trick the same as the magicians and
                     wizards do their's. I can, in two cases out of three, beat them, you see; for I
                     roll with the regular dice, which very seldom count less than seven, while it
                     is almost impossible for mine to roll so high. This is so perfect an
                     arrangement that no one would suspect it; for instance, when people doubt
                     others about cheating, they examine the cards or dice the suspected persons
                     use; but you see, it would little avail them in my case, for I make them cheat
                     themselves; the instruments they use are the spurious ones, and I use the
                     honest implements. I never but once was suspected, and that by a fellow from
                     New York city, and I insisted immediately upon having the dice examined, when
                     it was 
                        cleary
                        clearly
                      demonstrated to the uninitiated, that he had used the false dice, and
                     I the honest ones. He was immediately beaten by the gentlemen in the room, and
                     kicked out, while I was looked upon as a martyrized gentleman. Thus much for
                     the dice." Then going over another of his pockets, he pulled out a very heavily
                     chased silver cigar case. "Probably you will not take a cigar," said Frank,
                     smilingly; then he proceeded. "Now, if I should get taken into custody by some
                     of the marshal's emissaries, they would not be able to tell that this
                     magnificent cigar case is neither more nor less than a card case. You observe
                     that that silk lining, which looks as though it went to the bottom of the case,
                     is shaded dark around the edges, to produce the effect of depth; the cigars are
                     very flat, and ones that I never smoke; there is a false bottom to this;" and
                     then Frank turned it over upon the palm of his hand, and then a lid sprang
                     open, where the bottom should have been; and here lay, snugly concealed, a pack
                     of very clean and fine cards. "Now these cards, said he, may be all known by
                     their backs; these are what are called marble cards. You will observe that
                     there is a line runs peculiarly at each corner, but all different, but so
                     slightly that no one would perceive the difference; but I know every card of
                     importance by its back, and can tell what kind of hand my adversary holds;
                     This, of course, is an illimitable advantage. But further, by being dexterous
                     in shuffling, I can deal myself or partner just what kind I please. I generally
                     manage to give my opponents a good hand, if we have got a great start in the
                     game, and allow them to go ahead somewhat; but making sure to pick them up when
                     the time comes for winning." He then illustrated some tricks, in which Helen,
                     at the request of Frank, would ask for just such cards as she wanted, and he
                     would deal them out with the dexterity of an old player, and without any
                     apparent fraud. She was surprised. He said that the way he managed to get his
                     cards introduced was, by becoming acquainted with some one on the boat, in
                     whose hands he would place the deck, so that, when cards are called for, these
                     useful articles are
                     produced according to arrangement, which, he remarked, was a ten dollar
                     perquisite for the person. "Or if I am in a room—and gamblers are generally
                     very cautious about procuring a new deck of cards, whenever they are about to
                     play—I put a poor looking boy there, whom they generally select to go for a new
                     deck. He pretends not to know me, nor I him; but all the time he has my cards
                     in his pocket. I use a great many decks in the course of the year; and we—that
                     is to say, myself and a few others—keep a man engaged in making them. He gets
                     sixteen dollars a pack for them, and makes some fifty or sixty dollars
                     regularly per week."
                  Helen was much astonished and delighted with this information, as she saw
                     vividly that, with Paton's help, they might soon make an immense amount of
                     money between the three. She communicated the whole to Charlotte, before whom
                     Frank effected numberless tricks, which further convinced Charlotte of his
                     being a master in the art. Before the night was out, the two young ladies
                     understood the theory of shuffling cards; and before a fortnight was over, they
                     could "make the cards speak," as Paton termed it. The intermediate time was
                     spent in luxury and gaiety; and Charlotte and Helen made many acquaintances
                     among the roues, and many conquests among the confiding jackanapes who abound,
                     and believe that every woman whose course they cross, is in love with them.
                  We will close this chapter by introducing an occurrence which intervened, and
                     caused no inconsiderable excitement in the city of brotherly love. At a ball
                     given for the benefit of a military company, Helen became acquainted with a
                     citizen soldier of great wealth and high repute, and he frequently visited at
                     the house of the twin sisters, and with whom Charlotte contracted an
                     acquaintance of a disreputable character. But Mr. Merton did not contribute so
                     largely to her support as she expected; indeed, it was an affair of disgrace
                     which she had entered into with an idea of its turning out profitable. So it
                     was arranged that Frank, who was the constant companion of Helen, and the two
                     sisters, should administer a sleeping draught in some wine, which should be
                     partaken of by Merton exclusively, and then his pocket book was to be
                     extracted. A splendid supper was arranged and laid out, and combined all the
                     luxuries of the season. The wine was passed around, and being some choice
                     Curacoa and Chateaux Marjorex, delighted and tickled Merton's epicurean
                     desires; but in a few minutes more, the worthy gentleman was so overcome that
                     it was found necessary to send home the stupified man in a conveyance. In the
                     morning, when he awoke, he missed his wallet, and feeling confident that he had
                     left it at the young ladies', he immediately set off in search of the lost
                     article, which was valuable for its contents. He found the three at breakfast,
                     of which they invited him to 
                        prrtake
                        partake
                     . He did so, but was surprised to hear nothing about his lost
                     property; he, however, thought it was merely a joke, and when they all denied
                     having seen it, he merely laughed; but Frank asked him if he was in earnest in
                     supposing that they would be guilty of robbery. Merton replied, that having
                     been the worse for liquor upon the previous evening, he thought it quite
                     possible that, as his friends, they might have extracted it from his pocket,
                     with the idea of returning it to him when he should next call. Charlotte was
                     sorry for his loss, or pretended to be so, but was very much surprised at
                     Merton's conduct. He at the same time began to feel more and more convinced of
                     his not being any where else on
                      the previous evening, and the fact
                     of his so soon becoming oblivious and stupefied by a very small share of wine,
                     occurred to him; and being jaded on by some insulting remarks of Paton's, he
                     called Frank a blackleg and a thief. The latter challenged Merton to fight, and
                     before he could say a word, or take a step, the former, in an excited manner,
                     pulled from his pocket a pistol, and taking deliberate aim at his victim,
                     notwithstanding the entreaties, cries and shrieks of the young ladies, shot
                     Merton through the heart, who fell dead in a pool of his own warm blood. The
                     house was instantly broken into; the police secured Frank with the weapon in
                     his hand, and he was dragged off to prison to await his trial.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  It was only by a mere chance that Charlotte and Helen escaped being indicted
                     for the same offense with Paton; however, they were necessary to the evidence;
                     and certainly the public did not hold the young ladies altogether guiltless of
                     the matter. By an ingenious train of argument upon the part of Frank Paton's
                     counsel, it was demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that Merton had
                     tried to stab Frank, and that the pistol had been used by him in self-defence.
                     Certain it is, that when Merton fell a knife was found in his hand; but he had
                     made no effort, up to the time of his being shot, to stab Paton, His sentence
                     was five years imprisonment.
                  Bellair, who, it will be remembered, offered insult to Charlotte, at Cape May,
                     had been long since released from his short imprisonment, and had remained
                     silent some years; but, as the dust of prison wore off him, all his brazen
                     effrontery, varnished by a liberal education, once more manifested itself; and,
                     wincing under the sting inflicted by what he termed the scorpionism of
                     Charlotte L——, was bent upon revenge. One day he chanced to meet her at the
                     corner of Chesnut and Seventh streets, when he deliberately asked her, "How she
                     prospered with the dead man's money?" This vulgar allusion to her supposed
                     participation in the Merton tragedy, enraged Charlotte to a great extent,
                     seeing that she was thus meanly as sailed on the principal thoroughfare of
                     Philadelphia, before gaping hundreds. He promised her that he would meet her
                     repeatedly, and repeat the same offense. The proud, haughty, and revengeful
                     Charlotte was not to be used after this manner; so, placing herself near his
                     place of business, a couple of days after the transaction, Bellair soon espied
                     her, and accosted her in the same vulgar terms as before; but Charlotte, all
                     prepared, drew from beneath the ample folds of her cloak, a rawhide, with which
                     she belabored Bellair until he took to his feet, and was glad to escape. This
                     pleased the spectators, and gratified her; but she knew that those repeated
                     exposures, and coming in vulgar contact with the masses, would not add to her
                     reputation. So they, the twin sisters, determined to travel west and packed up,
                     and left their native city, never to return to it.
                  They spent a considerable time in the smoky region of Pittsburgh, where their
                     beauty rendered them attractive. Captains of the western boats, and southern
                     gentlemen, were introduced to them; and among their frequently newly formed
                     acquaintance, were not a few who loved gaming; and upon these occasions, they
                     used to advantage the tricks with the cards, that the unfortunate Frank Paton
                     had taught them. They were generally flush of money.
                  Charlotte, taking up a, Tennessee paper one day, read an account of a union, or
                     marriage, between Mr. Gerald Vernon and Miss Paumier, of Knoxville, Tennessee,
                     extolling, in glowing colors, the young lady's virtue and the gentleman's
                     probity; stating, furthermore, that the couple would take up their residence at
                     the Oliphant Farm, a beautiful property not far from Knoxville. Helen, upon
                     reading the paragraph, was aroused to a great excitement. The old passion she
                     had long since entertained, revived in her bosom, and once more she felt the
                     wrong of her youth very acutely; but at this time, not to become the lover of
                     Vernon, but rather desired to enjoy the pleasure of being revenged upon him. It
                     became a day thought and night dream with her. "Why," thought she, "should I be
                     branded as a perfidious woman, and he, who made me so, pass current with the
                     world as a virtuous man." No! she swore inwardly, that she would be revenged of
                     this man; that she would haunt him night and day! No! that she would teaze and
                     annoy him; and end by exposing his shame, and making known his early career. O,
                     what a terrible mind was hers! stern and bloody, resolute and unrelenting!
                  She told her sister that she was going to leave for Tennessee. Charlotte said
                     she would accompany her sister wherever she went, and through every trouble and
                     emergency; but advised her merely to make it a means for raising funds. To this
                     Helen at once assented; but in her heart there was buried the thirst for
                     Vernon's life. Helen sent for her boy—that illegitimate child, who was now, for
                     the first time in his life, to see the face of his father. Arrived at
                     Knoxville, they staid in most splendid apartments in the hotel there; and, of
                     course, two young and beautiful women, as they were, became the immediate
                     subject of village clatter.
                  The honeymoon of Gerald and his bride was not yet over, when, walking by the
                     window of the hotel, he saw a female face; like a flash of lightning, Helen's
                     former face came to his mind, and he rushed to the instantaneous conclusion
                     that it was she; but much changed from her virginal innocence to the bold
                     beauty of the woman of the world. He turned deadly pale, and exclaimed, "Great
                     God! can it be!" which alarmed the young and beautiful woman who hung, with
                     much endearment, upon the arm of her husband. She asked him what was the
                     matter; and it was with the utmost persuasion that she became convinced it was
                     a mere spasm which had seized Vernon.
                  At evening, when the sun had gone down, and Vernon was sitting in one of the
                     commodious window sills, admiring the slowly approaching dark clouds which were
                     to make up night, with his bride beside him, listening to his remarks with an
                     avidity which bespake both her love and enjoyment. The windows and doors were
                     all wide open, as if to invite the poor and needy, and those stray gusts of
                     wind, which waft about at even time, in a warm climate like that of Tennessee,
                     which gives health and salubrity to the hot, dry summers.
                  
                  The house of Mr. Vernon was one of those large, commodious dwellings that
                     characterize the south and west. Built, unlike our northern city residences,
                     where every room is a kind of secret drawer in a writing desk, and requires an
                     ingenious mind to find them out. No; this was a house very large in all its
                     parts. Its tall was large enough for a residence; its drawing room was almost
                     as capacious as the senate chamber of a state legislature. Its grounds were
                     extensive, and certainly well laid out; while its front exhibited an utter
                     disregard for the economy of lumber; for there was a wooden balcony, huge, wide
                     and long, four immense pillars supporting a gigantic pediment head or
                     Corinthian cornice, which, if chopped up, would have supplied a poor family
                     with fuel for no inconsiderable time. The house had been newly furnished
                     throughout, and newly painted entire, which spoke most audibly of a new
                     possessor; and this was Mr. Gerald Vernon's abode at Knoxville, Tennessee.
                  As we have before said, his wife was living upon the honey of her husband's
                     lips, when two ladies, with a youth, entered. Gerald first, in courtesy, rises;
                     but as his eye rests upon the paragon of beauty, Helen, he almost sinks with
                     astonishment and despair. He tries to announce them by name to his wife, but
                     the words cleave to the roof of his mouth; at length he stammers out—
                  "Pray, be seated, ladies;" and Mrs. Vernon rises and places chairs for the
                     three personages just entered, when Helen says—
                  "There, Horace, go and embrace your father."
                  Vernon shudders, his wife wonders, and the boy says—
                  "So, that's my papa, of whom you have spoken so much."
                  "Yes, child; don't you see how glad he is to see you?" said Helen, with
                     remarkable self-possession. "Go, embrace him."
                  And then the child ran toward his father; but the latter merely extended his
                     hand, and, with the other, hid the gushing and heart-ending tears which were
                     oozing from his eyes. Mrs. Vernon, not being able to understand or fathom all
                     this, arose from her chair, and said, with great earnestness,
                  "I pray you, explain all this mystery."
                  "T is easily explained," answered Helen. "Yon crouching thing to whom you have
                     been allied, is a base seducer. He has seduced me; and that poor innocent boy,
                     who now clings to his hand, is the result of his base villainy;" and as she
                     repeated word after word, her voice arose with a fervency of passion not often
                     exhibited in Helen.
                  Mrs. Vernon, almost frantic, fell upon a sofa, merely uttering the words, "No,
                     no, no! it is not truth! I cannot believe you!"
                  "I would have a word with you, sir," said Helen to Vernon.
                  He stood up beside her, covering his confused face with his hands, when Helen
                     drew, from beneath her dress, a poignard, and ran it into the heart of Vernon,
                     who merely shouted, "I am murdered," and fell, scrambling to the chair from
                     whence he had just arisen, Mrs. Vernon uttered a loud shriek, on seeing her
                     husband fall, and had her hand upon the bell-pull. Helen rushed towards her,
                     and like an infuriated beast of prey, stabbed the woman in several places.
                     Charlotte stood horror-stricken and petrified. She had not expected her
                     sister's vengeance to take such a bloody course. Then Helen fell heavily upon
                     her face, amid the heavy death-groans of her two victims. Charlotte rushed
                     toward her sister, and tried to arouse her to a sense of their mutual danger,
                     and endeavor to induce her to fly the scene of this bloody and wholesale
                     murder. At this time there came in a posse of men, who had heard the screams
                     from the road, and who soon secured the sisters, while the unfortunate couple
                     were carried to couches, and attended by competent surgeons. But, alas! the
                     murderess' steel had entered too deeply into their hearts, and they soon
                     died.
                  This bloody and sanguinary deed caused the greatest excitement among the
                     citizens, and no sooner was it known than around the country it flew, with the
                     swiftness which always attends bad news. Never did occasion bring out more
                     undisguised wrath. Had it not been for the stern inflexibility of the officers
                     of the commonwealth, summary punishment would have been wreaked upon the young
                     and beautiful, but alas, base women.
                  The day at length came for the trial; and, after a long, painful, patient and
                     careful examination, the, two beauties were found guilty. Helen protested her
                     sister's innocence of the crime; but the jury had no evidence in coming to any
                     other conclusion but that she was guilty, and they were both sentenced to
                     undergo the extreme penalty of the law on the 20th of August. They were removed
                     accordingly to jail, and Helen immediately commenced the editing of a statement
                     of the affair, with a brief memoir of her life, hoping thereby to save her
                     sister from the executioner's hand; but when it was delivered into the hands of
                     the judge, and he refused to take any action in the matter, she had no more
                     hope. Charlotte had concealed some poison in the lining of her dress; the day
                     before the execution came, she partook of it, and when her door was opened, she
                     was discovered in the cell, a black and distorted corpse. Helen, on a bright
                     and clear morning, was led forth to the scaffold, and ended her eventful career
                     by being strangled before the gaze of many. A yell broke from the mass. She
                     protested her innocence to the time of the rope being adjusted, prayed, and in
                     another moment she was swinging in the air, a vibrating corpse. The spectators
                     slowly moved away from the revolting spectacle, let us hope, better persons.
                     And, in conclusion, we trust, that those who rise from this book, will bear
                     before their minds the career and; fatal termination of Helen and Charlotte
                     L——, the Twin Sisters of Philadelphia.
               
            
            
               
               
                  
               
               THE ROBBERS.
               The discovery of gold in California has given a change to the affairs of the whole
                  world. Since the first yield of the precious metal to Mr. Sutter, the race of
                  mankind has been unsteady and transitory. While a new state has become settled, we
                  might say, the rest of the universe has been unsettled. The eye of man has become
                  gorged with visions of wealth, and stories of streams running with precious gold,
                  and of mountains whose height is the almighty metal. All these illusions have
                  aroused the latent spirit of enterprise in the unfortunate; has given scope to the
                  vicious cravings of depraved hearts, and rein to the unbridled lusts of the
                  dissipated. It has opened fields of enterprise, and revealed to us forests of
                  vice. California gold has subverted religion, and made for us thieves instead of
                  believers. Its highways, while they are choked with poor, honest, industrious men,
                  seeking that which, in more Northern latitudes, they have never had, or, perhaps,
                  have lost; fathers seeking dowers for their children, and a competence for old
                  age; husbands pining for their wives, but hoping soon to carry back to their
                  beloved ones, the only remaining link in the chain of happiness unconnected, and
                  that is money; the young man who, desirous of procuring a name or a fortune, also
                  clogs the thoroughfare; there is, lurking in the train, men whose life is alcohol,
                  whose happiness is gaming, whose religion is money, and whose social comforts are
                  to be found in nothing save in their own notions of them. Gold and crime have been
                  synonymous terms since the discovery of the mines. It has brought into the world
                  more scoundrels, more accomplished ruffianism, than whole ages could have
                  otherwise organized.
               Though the history of these pages is not immediately connected with California,
                  yet the men whose doings we are about to narrate, operated on the highway to the
                  gold regions, and lived upon the unwary traveler, or the boxed up earnings of
                  thousands, passing, as they hoped, to their Expectant friends. But, alas! what
                  must have been their feelings on both sides? of him in Oregon more acute, who has
                  labored in fear of life, early and late, with relentless trouble, grasping, and at
                  length, by the force of his energy, plucking out of the bowels of the earth, his
                  first instalment to his friends at home. O, how most painful to those who are
                  waiting the arrival of every steamship with anxiety, and learn, by letter, of gold
                  to come; then, to hear of robbery and tales of loss. Yet even so it is; plunder is
                  the order of the day. We should hope that in a land where the precious ore is to
                  be gained by working for it, that few men would desire to gain the goal by a shorter route. Let us opine that this
                  is dying out. When the ploughshare is used; when the busy wheel of the mill shall
                  foam and ripple the gushing creek; when the sledge hammer shall be wielded by the
                  adventurer; when the loom and shuttle shall play; then shall the frightful deeds
                  which have been committed in the name of civilization and commerce, be scarce in
                  the historian's lore. As these are transpiring, so is crime being hunted out of
                  existence. Let us hope that American enterprise, which has dispatched the Indian
                  to the west, and made his vast hunting ground into a garden, will blot out of
                  existence the labyrinth of iniquity which has so quickly grown up in that newest
                  of new worlds—California. On the Isthmus of Panama existed, and probably now
                  exists, in some shape, a desperate and rapacious set of men, combining their
                  united strength for plunder, and even murder, if necessary to the accomplishment
                  of their base and foul designs. Their name is 
                     THE ROBBERS.
                   Their scene of labor is in the mountains which the passenger crosses to reach
                  the city of Panama. Every tree might tell a tale of robbery; every nook and cranny
                  have been hiding places for ill-gotten store; and the waters of its rivulets have
                  been, crimsoned with the blood of butchered victims.
               You have heard, reader, of mining associations, and gold washing associations and
                  companies organized for the opening of huge gambling houses, and palaces of vice
                  of another character; but as yet, with all the writings which have deluged the
                  reading public upon the mighty Eldorado before your eye, with letter upon letter.
                  Which have added to your knowledge, you probably have not heard of associations of
                  thieves, robbers and assassins. Depravity is so low, and the gain so high, that
                  men have actually left the olden countries to become members of banditti. Highway
                  robbery on the isthmus, is as romantic and chivalrous an affair as we read of in
                  Spanish and Italian novels; but the former are, in truth, known, while, for the
                  latter, we have only to rely upon the inaccuracy of romancists for our
                  information. The Derienni comprised intellect, perseverance, daring and unanimity,
                  worthy of a better cause. Its deeds we shall bring to light; its more prominent
                  crimes will be found in, these pages. Regardless of consequences, but mindful of
                  truth, shall we push our work through to the last.
               The public of Panama city has done its duty, in sending into the interior a band
                  of honest men, to risk their lives in the summary punishment of the Derienni.
                  Their labors were attended with partial success; they have scotched the snake, but
                  not killed it. The monster Derienni shows its head now, sometimes, and when the
                  stakes are ample, is not backward in making war upon life and property; and too
                  often do we hear of a traveler murdered for the few grains of gold in his
                  possession; and a mail train is occasionally attacked, and slaughter may
                  transpire. We give the lives of the three men shot by citizens; they were hardened
                  and depraved ruffians, but had been innocent once; and that remark contains a
                  moral to the thinking mind, which may be of service at a future time. We do not
                  pander to any morbid taste; but hope, by the exhibition of vice in its nudity and
                  its undistorted state, to cause the young man to avoid the embrace of crime, and
                  follow the path of honesty, perseverance and virtue, the only true road to wealth
                  and peace.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  A CONVERSATION—THE CABIN AND ITS OCCUPANTS—THE DEAD MAN—THE
                     ATTACK AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
                  "Well, Hank," said a brawny-looking fellow, putting his feet upon the only
                     table that served the apartment, "that express man fought like a wild
                     fellow."
                  "He did so," answered another man, similarly dressed, and of about the same age
                     as the last. "Easing that train was a darned tough job, warn't it?" and up went
                     the speaker's feet upon the other side, and, with an air of nonchalance, he
                     stowed away a big quid of tobacco behind his cheek.
                  "I would n't like to run the risk of another muss like that; great risks and
                     small profits, Hank;" and the latter, in a most easy manner set to whittling
                     the logs of the cabin, against which he was sidewise reclining.
                  "Joe, boy," said his companion, "I tell you there haint such bad profits upon
                     that haul. It was a $13, 000 trade, and that aint bad. No, sir!" said he, in an
                     emphatic manner.
                  "Well now, you divide that between fifteen fellows, and it haint worth the risk
                     of losing your breath for," answered his companion.
                  "Not so bad, old fellow, when we take into consideration the other work we've
                     done lately." Then, changing his manner, "I wonder how that other expedition is
                     going to succeed. It comes off to-night!"
                  "Well," said his friend, "the boys are going to have a tough time of it. Them
                     fellers are desperate chaps, and haint going to knock under without a struggle;
                     but as our boys are well mounted, and have good nags under 'em, I don't fear
                     the consequences," he continued hopefully.
                  "I wish, Hank, they had let us gone off with 'em. I hate this mounting guard.
                     It's a slow business—d——d slow!" and the man seemed to grow restless and
                     uncomfortable.
                  "O, well, these things must be done; so it's no use worrying. Let's take a
                     nap;" and, bounding from the table, the man threw himself upon a matting.
                  "Agreed," said his friend, following suit, drawing his bed across the door way,
                     which he closed. In another minute the two men were fast asleep.
                  
                  The scene was decidedly picturesque, though not comfortable. The interior of a
                     log hut, which was no more than a barrier against the inclemency of the
                     weather, being rude and ungarnished by wall furniture. A few weapons hung
                     around the interior. Powder flasks, scabbards, cigars, bottles, knives, and
                     revolvers, were carelessly thrown upon rude shelving; while garments and Panama
                     hats hung around in profusion. A dim oil lamp was suspended from the roof; and
                     huge trunks, with ponderous locks, served as seats. Opposite to the door at
                     which one man was sleeping, was another door, which opened upon a smaller hut
                     or cabin, in which, it was plain, the culinary or cooking affairs were carried
                     on; for there, huddled up in a corner, with his immense chin hanging on his
                     breast, lay a fat negro, who was sleeping with his arms locked around his knee,
                     and snoring aloud.
                  This cabin was the temporary residence of the terrible "Derienni." It was
                     situated in a deep ravine, by a curious and intricate side of a mountain. It
                     was not observable from the muddy, stony and difficult road, as it was secluded
                     by the hanging boughs of many trees. Not even from the highest hill could you
                     perceive anything of it, even in day time, more than a streak of smoke
                     struggling through the leaves, to mingle with the skies above.
                  The two men who were sleeping in the cabin, though of the same
                     profession—either brave, dauntless and sanguinary—were of different build.
                     Hank, as his friend called him, was named Harry Ryer, a large, athletic,
                     powerful man, with a frame displaying energy and elasticity, and a face tanned
                     by Southern sun, rendered still more dark by black, shaggy eyebrows, and hair
                     of the darkest dye, growing over his lips and chin, and bristling all over his
                     face, that left but a small matter of cheek, and his eyes, and a narrow strip
                     of forehead unhaired. He had on one of those flexible felt hats, with a broad
                     supple brim, which lend such a look of chivalrous daring to the Spanish. He
                     wore a light green coat, most fantastically ornamented with bright buttons. A
                     big belt and buckle girdled his waist, and gave a symmetry to the hugeness of
                     his form. His pantaloons were dark, and rolled up over a pair of ferocious
                     Wellingtons; and there he lay, in the slumber of powerful and vigorous health,
                     with a blanket thrown carelessly over him, and a straw bed, with a stained
                     covering, beneath him. The other man was not over five feet five in height, of
                     light frame, but so encumbered with clothing that he looked a much more
                     desperate customer than he would if he had been dressed as a fashionable New
                     Yorker. His hair was of a reddish turn, and hung in profusion, and though his
                     eyes were blue, and his complexion delicate, yet he looked like a man who had
                     done some service, and could do it again. They had been taking a long nap, when
                     suddenly the tramp of heavy feet was heard outside; then came a tremendous
                     lunge at the cabin door, which brought Hank to his feet, as nimble as possible;
                     and Joe was awake, but the old cook still slept on.
                  "Hold on, boys, a minute, till I move the bed," and Hank, with the rapidity of
                     lightning, hurled the bed from the threshold, and four men entered, carrying a
                     wounded body, and two others followed, bearing a box, small and almost square,
                     made out of very heavy lumber; in short, a "specie box."
                  None of the men spoke a word, but looked sad and heavy enough, as they
                     deposited the dying man upon a matting, which Joe rapidly spread upon the
                     chest, and then, taking off their hats, they wiped the perspiration from their
                     brows. The two fellows, putting down the specie, and just relieving themselves
                     of a few encumbering articles they carried about them, went out again for the
                     purpose of taking charge, and stalling their nags for the night. The remaining
                     four, emptying their pockets, and pulling off their coats, formed a picturesque
                     group, with their red and blue flannel shirts, their different attitudes of
                     sympathy over the man, illuminated by the heavy light of their old lamp.
                  "Here's a bad job," said Hank; "can anything be done?"
                  "Nothing," replied Mathew, or Mat, and boss, as he was sometimes called; and
                     another remarked, in a brief manner, "He's a goner;" and a third, in a husky
                     voice, "Shot three times about the heart;" while a fourth was staunching the
                     blood of his expiring companion upon his knee, with an immense bundle of rags.
                     It was, after all, a pleasant sight to behold these men. How affectionately did
                     they tend their friend! Not a word escaped them about the booty. Their minds
                     were absorbed in his very look; and every wry face that the poor fellow made
                     was rewarded and answered by an eloquent look of compassion from his fagged and
                     rough companions; till at last his head fell heavily upon the man's arm who
                     bore it; his eyes were open and garish, but Dan Decker was a dead man.
                  For a few minutes after this, there was a dead silence. Not a word was uttered,
                     till Mat said, "Boys, let's to bed. We'll bury the poor fellow tomorrow
                     evening."
                  The time of undressing was speedy; and, in a few minutes more, the other two
                     returned from the stables, and the eight men retired to rest, in a manner that
                     bespake their grief most emphatically. Not a sound escaped them. Rest soon
                     came, to their eyelids, and there reigned in the cabin a silence as profound as
                     its tenant—death.
                  These men, all members of the Derienni, set forward that night to rob a small
                     band of merchants who were returning from the golden regions to their mother
                     States, with the rich rewards of their industry with them. The band of Isthmus
                     pirates had been advertised of their coming, by a member of the body in
                     Sacramento city; but he only told of there being three in number, so that the
                     Derienni thought six would effect the business easily; and that being their
                     number without the two who were always left at home, they did not think it
                     worth while to ask assistance from their friends at Chagres, Panama or Gorgona,
                     at either of which places they had formidable fellows, in all numbering thirty
                     men, inclusive of their own strength. As night approached, Mat, who commanded,
                     was standing upon an eminence, when he perceived, through his spy-glass, a
                     train approaching, and communicated to the boys that he could plainly discern
                     seven men with it. They felt a little surprise, but knew no fear of success.
                     Mat, then gathering them, he asked whether they would chance it, or let the
                     train pass; when Dan Decker said, springing up from the sward, "Boys, haint six
                     of us enough for any seven? Shall the Derienni come down so soon. No! let's do
                     our work like men." The six then determined upon standing the hazard of the
                     die, and a loading of arms, and a preparation for an attack commenced, with
                     that promptitude and method so peculiar to this band. The men were fixed: two,
                     Mat and another, on one side of the road, at a bend, were to attack the party
                     on the right, and Decker and another were located on the opposite side, while
                     two, with rifle pieces, were to attack the
                      party in the rear. The procession came at length, slowly and
                     tediously dragging along, when Mat shouted "Fire," and the four men took aim
                     and fired with a rapidity and precision that would have done honor to the most
                     experienced disciplined soldiers. When the smoke cleared away, the unwary
                     travelers had scarcely recovered from their surprise, and had just time to
                     perceive that one of their number had fallen from his mule, and that he was
                     mortally wounded, when the roar of guns was heard in the rear, and, in another
                     minute, the six men, determined upon making their visit good, flew from their
                     hiding places, and attacked the travelers with the utmost ferocity and daring.
                     Each party being well armed, the struggle continued for a few minutes with
                     great heat, when Dan Decker fell from the shot of a revolver, from the hands of
                     one of the travelers. This incited and excited the Derienni, and they fought
                     with demon-like ferocity. Cut, slash and fire was the order of the time till
                     they hewed down the man who was riding upon the mule laden with the box of
                     specie. One of the pirates, drawing the mule away, secured it to a tree, and
                     then returned to the scene of action, to fight it out. The five remaining
                     travelers put their boots to the mules' sides, and succeeded in making their
                     escape, while the poor native guide, and one of the merchants, were left to
                     mark the scene of a desperate and bloody conflict. In a few minutes, the
                     mangled corpses were washing down the rapids, and four of the party had Decker
                     on their shoulders, and were carrying him home to their cabin; two following,
                     leading the horses, and carrying the money box.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  THE BURIAL—THE STORY TELLING ARRANGEMENT—LIFE OF MAT, THE
                     BOSS.
                  Gus. Randall and Rob. Bowler, two members of the Derienni, set to work early in
                     the morning, digging a grave for their deceased companion. It was a custom with
                     this, band that their men should be buried in a decent manner, or as near to
                     decency as they could approach. They cleared a spot—a kind of jungle—and
                     beneath this was the dead carcass laid. There was no mummery of prayers, for
                     none were there who felt competent to the task of uttering them; nor were any
                     chaunts uttered, nor disgraceful lines repeated, as has been often the case
                     with organized bands of ruffians; but it was a calm, quiet, serious affair. The
                     night was beautiful and moonlit, and no idea could be had of the natural
                     romance of such a scene. The sentiment of the occasion was indeed beautiful.
                     When the men returned to the cabin, they sat for a few minutes, some reading
                     novels or old letters, others smoking cigars, till Mat called upon "Uncle," or
                     Unc., as it was sometimes abbreviated, for a bottle of brandy, and some
                     glasses, with which the old colored man came in, rocking from side to side like
                     a narrow-beamed ship in a hurricane, and, waddling to the table, put down all
                     that was required.
                  "Some sugar, Unc," said Joe
                  
                  "Hi, hi," replied the old man, in a very seaman-like manner, and the men,
                     throwing off their previous gloom, prepared for a carousal.
                  "Boys," said Mat, rising to his feet, "we have lost a good friend, a good pal,
                     and a good worker for the Derienni. Dan Decker was the second man who joined
                     this enterprise. I was the first, and I say it with pride, who organized this
                     conspiracy, with little hopes of its reaching its present powerful and
                     influential position. Now, I am not going to make a long speech; but I want you
                     to understand that the laws of the Derienni require us to pay due respect to a
                     brother chip who chances to be croaked while in the order. We have paid him
                     that, and we should be unmanning ourselves if we continued to be low-spirited
                     on his account. Let us hope that Dan is better off. He may go to worms, or to
                     the devil, or to God; but I believe such a good fellow can only go to heaven.
                     Now, gentlemen, I have nearly done. Our business is to drink to his memory, and
                     then drown the subject in a bowl and song, and proceed with our calling like
                     true men. Here's" said Mat, lifting a heavy glass filled with brandy to his
                     lips, "here's to the memory of Dan Decker," and the fellows, rising to their
                     feet, knocked the bottoms of their tumblers on the table, and then, raising
                     them to their lips, drank off the contents, with the name "Dan Decker." Down
                     they sat again, and Joe, who was considered the best singer, led off with the
                     splendid song of "Paul Clifford," which his manly voice and natural dignity did
                     ample justice to, and it was loudly applauded. Then followed Rob. Bowler with
                     the song "Whisky in the Jar;" but when Mat was called upon, which, of course,
                     was a compliment, for he seldom sung, save in a chorus, he said, in his usual
                     coarse manner, "Lads, I'm no singer, and you know it. I generally tell you a
                     yarn, which you accept as an apology, but to-night I am going to give my life.
                     I am an old salt, and have many yarns stowed away up here," and he pointed to
                     his head. "As this is an extraordinary 'casion, I shall tell you my history. I
                     shall give you my life, as near as I can recollect it, from the first day Mat
                     knew what he was, and a little afore." The boys seemed pleased with the
                     arrangement, and, upon Mat's invitation, each man took another tug at the
                     brandy bottle; and then came a terrible bustle in the way of cigar lighting,
                     throwing away old soldier's, and putting in their mouths new ones, and placing
                     their feet in a very elevated and comfortable position. Mat was a kind o'
                     righting himself, and taking another small horn. He asked the boys—"All
                     aboard?" They replied—"All aboard;" and Mat commenced:
                  "Well, here's
                  
                     "THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF MAT ROWLEY, THE BOSS DERIENNI.
                     "Well, you all know that I am a regular full-blooded Yankee. I was born in
                        the town of New Bedford. My father was a Cape Cod fisherman afore me, and,
                        of course, it was very natural I should be a fisherman arter him. Well, I am
                        now—I am. Let me see," and the old man looked up to the oil lamp, for the
                        purpose of jogging his memory. "Yes; I'm nothin' short o' fifty-two years
                        old, boys. Well, the old man died early; much afore he'd oughter, and left
                        me, a boy of nineteen years old, to bring up my two young sisters, and
                        attend to my mother. Well, I worked hard. I tell you. I fished later in the
                        season, an' earlier too, than other men; and many a frozen finger and toe
                        have I had off them Newfoundland banks. Howsomever, I was nothin' daunted,
                        and my mother was as happy as her lone situation would allow her to be. She
                        was a pooty woman, boys, and my sisters was two sweet looking critters as a
                        man looked at. One was named Isabella, and the other they called Laura. Two
                        spry names, warn't they?" and the boys nodded assent. "Well, nothin'
                        particler happened, and all went along to hum as slick as needs be, when one
                        day I returned to our pleasant cottage, and who should I find there but a
                        fellow as they called Hiram Garnett. I thought that he'd come to borrow a
                        net or line, or summut for boat gear. So I set myself down, an' axed Hiram,
                        'What's new?' and he seemed quite bamboozled, and in a kind o' fizzle, and
                        said, 'Nothin' new.' He then got up, and walked his carcass away. When he
                        was gone, I made bold to ax mother what Hiram wanted. She was astonished and
                        bewildered, and I felt more anxious to learn what Hiram wanted, 'cos he
                        never came to our house afore. Well, she kind o' baulked. But I warn't to be
                        beat slowly, so I swore by G—— she must tell me directly. Well, she
                        shuddered as I swore, for it was the first time I ever took an oath in her
                        presence. She said 'No good would come of my swearing,' and then she up'd
                        and told me how Hiram made love to her, and wanted her to consent to marry
                        him. And then she burst into tears. I felt kind o' bad, and my blood warmed;
                        and although I was then only a young un, I determined upon being even with
                        Hiram for his insult to my lone mother. So, one day, a few of us boys were
                        talking on shore, while repairing our canvass, about a big haul we'd made,
                        and this Hiram interfered with us, and doubted something I said. Well, as
                        the saying is, one word brought up another, and I told him he had insulted
                        my mother. He doggedly replied, 'My mother warn't no better than she should
                        be.' Upon which I rose up from my sitting, and, drawing off with all my
                        might, I struck Hiram upon the temple, a heavy blow with my marlinspike,
                        that shattered his head, brought him reeling to the ground, and in a few
                        minutes Garnett was dead. All the fellers were taken aback, and set to
                        carrying off the body, and I made my escape to the road, and cut along, and
                        for several days wandered through the country like a stray dog. I had
                        neither appetite nor rest. I could not work. I was like a mad feller, until
                        one day I arrived in Boston. Here the immense population, and the strong
                        wall of houses made me feel safe from the pursuers' vigilance, and finding a
                        vessel bound for Liverpool, I engaged with the skipper as an apprentice,
                        and, after a run of fifty-one days, which, afore these ocean steamers or
                        Baltimore clippers had brought the old soil within a fortnight's voyage of
                        us, was considered very fast work. Although I liked the sea, I left my ship,
                        and was determined to scrape up an acquaintance with Master Johnny Bull.
                        Well, I was only a lad, and I got kind o' home-sick, and felt as how I'd
                        like to see mother; and yet I was scared to go home; and every thing I eat
                        went agin me. I longed for buckwheat cakes and molasses. I liked hard cider
                        better than their bully ale; and I tell you I felt as though I must die
                        without some codfish, cooked as the old woman knew how. I was working at a
                        warehouse on the dock, and was mocked by the men, who grinned at my Yankee
                        greenness; but they were all pooty good-natured fellers, and I did n't mind
                        it at all. They soon made me their acquaintance and one of them
                        introduced me to what he called 'life.' I fretted so much after my mother,
                        and I could not return to her, that I found a solace for my misery in drink.
                        I very often returned to my bed a drunken fool. Then, of course, I had not
                        the experience in liquor I have now.
                     "Well, I soon got out of work, and I found it bard to get into a berth
                        again; so I removed to the neighborhood of Primrose Hill. Here I soon found
                        a companion, in a woman named Sal Magnus. She earned enough 'tin,' as she
                        called it, for the pair, and I became a fancy man. Sal was not a common
                        prostitute, but what they call a picking-up woman in those parts. She would
                        hail a fellow, keep him in tow for a few minutes, and end her interview by
                        easing the fellow of his purse, his pocket handkerchief, or anything else
                        she could grab. She was pretty generally successful, so we had lots of money
                        and lots of fun. Gin made me forget my home, and prosperity hardened me to
                        deeds of desperate character However, my gal was nabbed one night, and got
                        seven years transportation. Her defence took all the money we had collected
                        together, which was about forty pounds, and I was left in the world, without
                        a character and without the means of employment. So I then turned what they
                        cal 'sneak.' I used to write a neat letter. (I larned to write when I was
                        East.) I'd then walk out and knock at some rich man's door, deliver the
                        letter to the lackey or servant gal, he or she, whichever it might be, 'ud
                        then take the letter to their master, as they call bosses there, and I'd
                        bolt off with all the loose overcoats and trifles that was hanging in the
                        hall, while the boss was reading my note, and the servant was waiting for an
                        answer. I was very successful for six months. I could, average in my
                        earnings, about five dollars a day; but I was overhauled, and they sent me
                        to the Lancaster jail for a year.
                     "I served my time, and made the best of my way towards Manchester. Let me
                        see, it was about forty miles. I walked very hard, and did it in a day. I
                        arrived very much fatigued, so I went straightway to Dan Galligan's, a
                        brother to the man who bought my stolen goods of me in Liverpool. He knew
                        me, having once seen me to his brother's. He kept what they call there a
                        clothes shop, down a cellar in Swan street. He behaved very good to me, and
                        introduced me to a number of thieves who operated in different ways; also,
                        to a very fine looking woman, named Mary Bowers. She was a tall, splendid
                        craft, and was dressed A. No. 1. Dan said that it was a special favor this
                        introduction to Mrs. Bowers, for she was considered not alone one of the
                        handsomest and showiest women out, but she was one of the best workers in
                        the town. By this he meant she was an accomplished and ingenious female
                        thief. Mary was a woman of good breeding and education, and used to play the
                        lady in good style. She had never been an inmate of a brothel, nor did she
                        bargain away her charms for gold. I was simply a business partner; and
                        although I passed as her husband, it was a long time before, in private, she
                        would allow me to approach her familiarly. Galligan provided me with dress;
                        and although he had plenty of superior second-hand clothing, which even
                        respectable men wear in the old country, still he persisted in my having my
                        clothes made to order. He then put in my pocket a splendid gold watch and
                        chain, and in my breast a magnificent 'prop,' or diamond pin. Mrs. Bowers
                        and myself started on our mission. We were to stay at hotels in large
                        cities, and 'operate' upon
                         plate at table. We carried on
                        our game, managing to do a large business; and when this failed, we planted
                        'bogus bills' on to the house. Our magnificent dress arrested all suspicion;
                        and good dress and lots of baggage will take an old country hotel keeper off
                        his guard, for traveling is not so general as in the States. We traveled in
                        this way for two years, and sent all the proceeds to Dan. He used to keep an
                        account—debtor and creditor—and pretended to work for a small percentage;
                        but that was all gas. He made the rocks, while we ran the risk of being sent
                        to Van Dieman's Land. I recollect the last bit of business that Mary and I
                        transacted together was the following: But boys," said Mat, "let's liquor. I
                        find this yarn is too long a one; so, if you'll let me off, I'll own up the
                        corn, that I've begun what I can't keep through." They all persisted in his
                        going on with the history, taking advantage of the pause to have a drink.
                        "Well, Dan gave us a one hundred pound bank of England note, about five
                        hundred dollars. He put us on what is called 'a plank,' and, providing Mary
                        and myself with a splendid horse and open carriage, we took a ride round.
                        Mary was to go a shopping; women buy the groceries there mostly. So, drawing
                        up to the principal establishment in St. Ann's Square, in Manchester, kept
                        by a very rich Quaker, Mary Bowers, escorted by a very perlite young man,
                        walked into this tea and sugar palace, for such it was in reality. They had
                        big plates of glass; and I stood at the door, watching the spanking horse I
                        had there, and eyeing the gorgeous harness and the magnificent shay with
                        pride and satisfaction, when one of the porters passed me and requested to
                        know where he should stow away the bundle of groceries. I told him to stow
                        it away mid-way; but as he was a land-shark, I had to stow away the cargo
                        myself, 'cos he did not understand me. This done, I returned to the store,
                        and Mary feigned sickness. She had not paid for the stuff—it was all
                        arranged,—and when she got upon the bottom step of the door-way—for their
                        shops go up a step or two—she fell, or stumbled against an immense pane of
                        glass, and shattered it into a thousand pieces. She, of course, fainted
                        away, and was led back again. The shop was in an immense flutter. I was, of
                        course, extremely busy, very much excited and distressed. But at length I
                        cooled down, when I saw Mary show symptoms of recovery. I was frantic with
                        joy, and the shopman, or clerk, seemed to show symptoms of great contempt
                        for my extraordinary love, when suddenly my Lucretia's eyes opened,
                        according to agreement, and she asked 'Where she were?' and 'Where was her
                        dear Horatio?' that was me, and a great deal more slang of the same sort;
                        when I got her into the chaise, and all was in order for a start, though
                        Lucretia, poor thing, was very weakly, and all the smelling salts were as
                        nothin' to her nose, I had the ribbons in my hand, when the old Quaker came
                        up, with a polished crown, and rubbing his hands as though he were using sea
                        water and soap. Says he, very timidly, 'I beg pardon, sir, but you have not
                        settled for your groceries, nor the pane of glass.' 'Botheration,' said I,
                        in a fluster, 'you talk of being a member of the society of Friends, and
                        yet, while my good lady is perhaps dying, you are following me up for a few
                        paltry shillings.' With all the English pomposity I could scare up, I said
                        this. He said, 'Those windows cost thirty pounds a piece. I will bear one
                        half, and thee the other, and that, with your lady's purchase—five pounds
                        two and sixpence—will be twenty pounds two and sixpence. Here Lucretia gave
                        a groan, and requested me to drive on; but I requested her to be calm a
                        while, and then we would drive home. I pulled out my hundred pound note, and
                        contemptuously threw it towards the Quaker, he glanced at it in a hurried
                        manner, rushed to the desk, and gave me my change—seventy-nine pounds
                        seventeen and sixpence; in all, about four hundred dollars, so we did not do
                        a bad job. Dan got a hundred dollars, and Mary and I divided the rest
                        between us. We then parted. She had very little cash, but a wonderful stock
                        of jewelry, worth in all over eight thousand dollars; while I had but a few
                        pounds left. Dan gave me a pile of notes, and hired a colored rascal to
                        serve me as valet. He had been a fiddler at dances. I was to travel as a
                        rich American slaveholder, all over the continent of Europe. I paid my
                        hotels in large bank bills of a bogus kind, and received good currency into
                        the bargain, and gambled largely. I did not do any tricks with the cards,
                        but confined myself to the bogus business. I did not care much whether I
                        lost or gained; but when I gained, I kept the good money, and losing, I paid
                        my debts in bogus; so it was a pretty sure business after all. Sam, the
                        colored chap I had with me, was a lazy, dull, impudent fellow, and scarcely
                        minded what I had to say. He threatened me, upon my promising to discharge
                        him, to give me up to the police. This was at Florence, in Italy. So, not
                        feeling safe, I made the best of my way back to Paris, when I gave him his
                        wages. I became reckless of what he could do; but he informed upon me, and
                        the commissary of police very politely tapped me on the shoulder, and asked
                        me for my passport, which I immediately showed to him. He pocketed it, and
                        requested me to follow him. I was soon in the presence of a magistrate,
                        charged, as I learned, with being a notorious swindler and passer of bad
                        money. My accuser was my discharged servant, who had no proof against me,
                        and therefore they had no power to detain me. I spent money profusely among
                        the gensd'armerie, and presented the captain of police, who took me on to
                        the court, an X, which I slipped into his hand on the way. I was soon
                        discharged from custody. I returned to my lodgings on the Rue de Richelieu;
                        and about three months afterwards, a man requested to see me. It was my
                        colored miscreant. He was in rags, and very poor. He had fallen away in size
                        wonderfully, and looked for all the world like a feller as had been fed upon
                        gunny bags for a few months. I was so enraged that I rushed towards him, and
                        gave him a sound lashing. Well, I kind o' felt for him arter, and gave him
                        five dollars; but I insisted on seeing him lay it out for a fiddle. He went
                        to work to fiddling, and soon earned a good living. He was very
                        thankful.
                     "After going over the continent again, right up into Poland, Turkey and
                        Russia, I returned to Liverpool, after an absence of five years. Here
                        Galligan hardly knew me. I then took to betting on races, and, as I had a
                        pile, I found little difficulty in making heaps of gold at that fun. I used
                        to see plenty of pleasure, and lived in this way for about five more years,
                        in great style; mixing with high and low, and leading a merry time, with
                        lots of money at all times. I felt an anxiety to hear how my mother came on
                        in the world. I found an American sailor—a young fellow, who was born in the
                        town of New Bedford. I met him accidentally, at a shipping office. He told
                        me of my mother's death, and that both my sisters were married to honest
                        fellers. I began to believe that my mother's prophecy, that no good would come of my swearing, was
                        about fulfilled. I then thought it would be best for me to return to the
                        States; and, going back into the sea-faring business, I got employment as
                        boatswain for a large line-of-packet ship. On the voyage, nothing particular
                        happened, save that I got into a row with the first mate about the
                        provisions, struck him, and was carried into New York in irons. I was
                        discharged before the alderman; so, for fear of being recognized as the
                        murderer of Hiram Garnett, I took ship for New Orleans, where, with the
                        money I had left, I became part owner and commander of a clipper built
                        schooner, as sweet a craft as ever spread canvass. I was commissioned to go
                        to the coast of Africa, and bring away negroes, and land them at the port of
                        Cardenas. My vessel was well manned and well equipped, and we made some very
                        profitable voyages. We were sometimes chased; once hotly by a big British
                        ship, which sailed fast for her tonnage; but our broad canvass, and immense
                        speed, made light of her shot. I had only one near approach to death. We
                        were overhauled by a Yankee brig off Cuba. They boarded us, and them Yankee
                        boys meeting us Yankees, it was a hard show. They fought for the
                        constitution, while we fought for our lives. We ultimately cut them down,
                        and made mince-meat of them. We killed three, wounded four, six jumped
                        overboard and were drowned, and we made prisoners of the remainder of the
                        crew, seven in number. They all turned out jolly good fellows; and, as we
                        lost ten of our men by ship fever soon after, and the rest were sick, the
                        fresh supply of men proved not only a boon, but our salvation. In that
                        affair I was fortunately saved by the timely defense of a chap as they
                        called David Breck. Well, I carried on the slave trade for about six years.
                        It was a profitable game; and when I left off, and sold the craft at
                        Norfolk, in Virginia, I had not less than, twelve thousand dollars, I then
                        went to gambling. I played a foolish game, and much as I knew of the tricks
                        of the table, I was seized with a desire for play. There's no accountin' for
                        this taste, for most men know that the chances are against 'em. I played on
                        for six months, and was left without a cent; and although I now commenced to
                        play upon no capital, I found I could make a living at that at which I had
                        lost a fortune. I one night was playing, for I was at the table eighteen
                        months in all, and rose without a cent in my pocket. I returned heavily
                        towards home; when, suddenly, thought I—Fred Pownell, the banker, would
                        return with his wife towards home. They lived out in the country. I waited
                        for them, under the shade of a tree; when, suddenly, they came to the spot
                        where I was standing. I emerged from it. 'Fred,' said I, 'I do n't want to
                        harm you, but I must have some money. You and your party have had my pile,
                        and I am determined to have some of it back.' He protested against giving a
                        cent; his wife remonstrated. 'By heavens, I am not going to be fooled. Now,
                        Fred,' says I, 'are you going to stump up a few thousands; you've got
                        plenty.' He was about answering by 
                           withrawing
                           withdrawing
                         his knife from his neck, when I anticipated him by drawing a
                        revolver, and shooting him through the head. I told the woman I would n't
                        hurt her. She defied me; and stealthily using her husband's dagger, stabbed
                        me slightly in the arm. Still, I would not wound her; but, taking my
                        handkerchief from my pocket, I bound it over her eyes, and tied her up to
                        the hedge, so that she could give no alarm, nor could she tell whither I had
                        flown. I made the best use of my legs until I reached a snip ready to make
                        sail for Charleston. I stowed myself amidships without being seen. Having
                        waited a day or two, she loosed her moorings; and as I had lots of money, of
                        which I had just possessed myself, wherewith to pay my passage, I found the
                        best of accommodation.
                     "After a pleasant trip of about seven weeks, we made Port Lavaca, in Texas,
                        I stayed in that country for about three years, following one business and
                        another; and at one time was engaged as a leader of a volunteer company to
                        defend American interests, and Texas particularly, against the Mexican
                        desperadoes on the Rio Grande. I went to California arter that, with some
                        Galveston fellers, when the gold fever broke out. There I kept a drinking
                        saloon, and was connected in business with a regular Tartar—a Spanish woman,
                        named Christiano Marino. She was not satisfied with taking a man's money,
                        and leaving him penniless, but was very fond of stabbing. Now, I did n't
                        like this eternal cutting and slashing; so I cut her and escaped to this
                        part of the world, where, for a long time, single-handed, I carried on all
                        the business on this Isthmus; and then I formed the Derienni. And then,
                        boys, you know the rest."
                     "Now, lads," said Mat, "let's liquor and go to roost."
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  THE GRENADIANS—THE DERIENNI—THE ATTACK—THE DROWNING MAN—THE
                     RETURN HOME.
                  In these pages, we have not dwelt at length upon the many monstrosities and
                     crimes of the bloody and sanguinary Derienni. Because, in feasts of blood we do
                     not love to gorge our readers. It is an unwholesome food; one that hardens the
                     mind, and makes callous the heart to the spilling of blood. Beyond a doubt, it
                     has been ascertained that such is the result; for in some countries, and in
                     several states of this Union, have the people gone so far as to abolish death
                     punishments, believing that, instead of changing or deterring men from cruel
                     murder, it merely produces and engenders an indifference to the spectacle of
                     death. We say that we have not detailed their numerous crimes upon the unwary
                     traveler, but one scene we cannot help recapitulating. The afternoon had far
                     progressed towards its successor—night. The immense sun was pouring down its
                     lava-like streams upon the isthmus from an almost purple face. The sky was
                     tinged with fiery hues, and nature seemed scorching beneath the scathing heat
                     of this all powerful sun. Three haggard and weary travelers were urging with
                     cudgels and feet their unwilling and fagged mules along, whose tongues hung
                     from their mouths, and, ever and anon, would stop and try to find water. But
                     little progress was made in this way; their coats were hidden beneath the white
                     foam of relentless perspiration, and the travelers, suddenly coming beneath the
                     grateful shade of a huge tree, they halted, and got down from their pommels.
                     These men were New Grenadians, who were crossing the Isthmus with some gold
                     belonging to their government, They then
                      observed the dust of riders coming toward them, and they thought,
                     although with no expectation of relief from the travelers, that they would
                     await in the shade their approach. Those whom they saw were the Derienni, upon
                     a scouring expedition. These had observed the travelers resting, and made
                     immediately toward them. Their mules having been but recently brought from the
                     barn, they were comparatively fresh arid vigorous. After a long and tedious
                     patience, the Grenadians saw the new-comers alight, and found, to their
                     chagrin, that they could only speak an occasional word of the native language.
                     This provoked the Derienni, who wanted to learn the cause of their travel; but
                     there were not many ceremonies, for the ruthless robbery approached the
                     saddle-bags of the mules, and commenced turning over the contents. When one of
                     them saw a large red seal upon an official, diplomatic kind of paper, they, the
                     Derienni, made up their minds that the strange travelers were agents for their
                     government. The surprised travelers pulled off the man who had taken such an
                     unwarrantable liberty, but were soon roughly handled, beaten and tied up for
                     their pains, while the Derienni quietly removed the saddle-bags from their
                     mules to the backs of their own. The Grenadians shouted and grimaced, but all
                     in vain; the robbers merely laughing at the curious faces they made. "Well"
                     said Mat, "having got so far, it's of no use going any further without caution.
                     Let's make up our reckoning, and ascertain where we are, throwing himself upon
                     the ground. The other pirates followed the example, and they held a
                     consultation upon the sward.
                  "Well," said Mat, "now that we have determined that these ere fellers be
                     government officers, it won't do, boys, to let em go, for their government will
                     send a number of men down upon us, and they will overpower us. Then we shall
                     taste a rope dance afore we want to do, that's all; so, let's steer clear of
                     breakers."
                  "Well," said Hank, "the only way is to put an end to there being any clue to
                     them," and out came his tobacco box.
                  "You mean, to kill 'em," said Mat.
                  "I do," replied he, coolly.
                  "Well, that's my opinion," said the boss.
                  The others concurred in this view, and the pirates arose from their seats with
                     determination marked upon their brows. Mat gave orders to one of their band to
                     lead home their newly-acquired mules and saddle-bags. The rest proceeded to
                     untie one of their victims from his stake. He made a desperate resistance, but
                     it was in vain. The five brigands tied his hands and feet, and then putting the
                     disabled man upon the back of a mule, one leading the beast, others held steady
                     the victim, until they reached the banks of the river, and then hurled the man
                     into the gushing creek. They turned not an eye to perceive what became of the
                     poor wretch they had so mercilessly murdered, but proceeded back to repeat the
                     crime upon a second, then upon a third victim. This being all got through, they
                     mounted the mules, and left the victims without remorse, pity or sense, a prey
                     to the rapids. One of the poor fellows, the second one, had not been confined
                     about the feet, like the first and last. The rope was certainly coiled, but the
                     knot was not a secure one; and when the man was in the water, being an expert
                     swimmer, he lay upon his back on the water, and managed to kick about with his
                     legs until he reached the opposite bank, after much
                      battling with the current. Here he lay exhausted for several hours,
                     with his arms tied. He tried to raise himself, but unsuccessfully, until he
                     dragged himself against the trunk of a tree. He managed to raise his body up by
                     a slow and tortuous process. This was a work of no mean labor, and the big
                     sweat drops stood upon his brow; he was almost exhausted. He walked slowly,
                     however, and, almost dead with exertion and fatigue, he arrived in Panama,
                     where his story was told, and a committee of public safety was the next day
                     organized, for the purpose of putting down these miscreants. The best men lent
                     their aid to the design, and there was great rejoicing when the mass learned
                     that the people were going to take the law into their own hands, and execute
                     that which their courts failed to touch. We are no friends to lynch law; it
                     robs the accused of every right of defense; but, we ask, will any man doubt the
                     wisdom of such a tribunal, where no other is calculated to be productive of the
                     like results, In a state, city or village where the law can be administered,
                     there is no necessity for the lynching system—it becomes in itself a curse; but
                     in a case like this, there can be no doubt of its justness and fitness.
                  The Derienni kept out that evening till the skies darkened. They traveled many,
                     many miles in search of new victims. Not a word escaped them, as they rode
                     along side by side, of pity for the poor wretches they had hurried into a
                     premature grave. On, on they rode; story after story was told; halt after halt
                     was made; observations taken, and nothing else appeared to attract their
                     ferocity and rapine; so, jaded and haggard, care worn and tired, they retired
                     to their cabin, and soon were buried in the deepest and profoundest sleep. Who
                     shall say whether such brutish men had dreams at all? If they did, what
                     spectres must have they seen? what misery must have been theirs. Rest to them
                     seems unnatural; for dreams, horrid hallucinations, black phantasies, and
                     dreaming tortures should be reserved only to plague the solitary moments of
                     such terrible beasts. And this is no tale, but a simple record of facts, which
                     are undeniably true.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  AN INCIDENT—AN ATTACK—GENEROSITY—HANK RYER'S HISTORY.
                  The next morning, Pete Dunham was perched in a high place, on the look-out. The
                     boughs of some splendid trees kept the sun from melting his burly frame, and
                     spying three specks in the distance, he kept his glass upon them, until they
                     had increased into a train of three mules. A shrill whistle made his friends
                     aware of the lucky discovery of a good chance for pillage. They were soon
                     equipped, and in about half an hour were near the spot where Pete was holding
                     his watch. A few stray steps of a dance, a song or two, a drop of brandy, and
                     whittling, managed to keep the party in amusement and glee, until the arrival
                     of the fresh victims.
                  
                  "Hold on," shouted Mat. "Bout ship!" as the three mules were carrying the
                     listless travelers along. The travelers seemed taken by a paralysis, so
                     surprised were they, when the Derienni coolly marched up to the
                     ex-Californians. Mat then said, "We're very sorry to trouble you,
                     gentlemen—very sorry; but the fact is, you've got a small commodity which we're
                     very much in need on, and that is gold. We expect toll here, at this 'ere
                     point; and as there are no justices at hand here, we're obliged to collect our
                     dues by main force, gentlemen."
                  At length, out spoke the old man, who was the father of his companions:
                  "If you wish the few grains of gold I have, I will give it you without a
                     murmur; but, gentlemen, I am a poor old man of broken fortunes. These young men
                     you see with me, are my two young sons. I have been in business in Eastern
                     Pennsylvania, where I failed, and we came out here to redeem our fortunes. I
                     mean to re-establish my character. I have just a few dollars over what will pay
                     my creditors. For God's sake, spare me, gentlemen; if you take from me these
                     few grains, I shall die of a broken heart, and those who had confidence in my
                     character will curse me in my grave. Rather kill me, and let my sons go home
                     with the money, that they may redeem their father's name. I have a family at
                     home, whose honor I wish to redeem; and in old age have I commenced a new life
                     in a new country; and just as I am returning to make peace with my Maker, and
                     die happy, I am met by you. You are all men; you have good hearts, and you
                     would not rob a poor old man, who is willing to sacrifice his life, but not his
                     honor," and the old man burst into tears. The young men plead in similar terms.
                     The old man cried and entreated, and the robbers, after consulting together,
                     determined to let the old man go. It was an awful moment of suspense for him;
                     but right conquered, and the three pursued their course, while the old man
                     delivered an audible prayer for the salvation of these desperate, yet noble
                     men.
                  That night the men were more joyous than usual, and over their cups they
                     laughed and joked with light hearts and great glee. Every anecdote was received
                     with laughter; every joke told twice well, when Hank said:
                  "I have a proposition to make. I was very much amused and gratified at our
                     boss's story of his life; and I would be glad if we should make it a rule that
                     each man should tell his story. Each life to occupy a night."
                  "Agreed, agreed," shouted the merry Derienni.
                  "Now, to make the thing all right, I will lead off with mine. It is not a very
                     amusing career; but, as I make the proposition to others, I think it right that
                     I should set the example myself."
                  This brief speech was received with loud shouts of "Aye, aye;" and then
                     commenced the rotary movements of a black brandy bottle, a lighting of cigars,
                     and an arrangement of seats; when Mat, placing himself at the head of the
                     table, with his tumbler of brandy before him, asked,
                  "All aboard?"
                  The boys replied, "All aboard," as a signal for going on, and Gus shouted in
                     enthusiasm, "Hank, let her rip."
                  "Boys," said Hank, "I am no great hand at telling stories. I want the language,
                     and lack the taste for such an operation But no matter, here goes for the
                  
                     "LIFE OF LOAFER HANK,
                     "As they used to call me. My eyes first opened on the 'Points,' of New York
                        city. We lived on a back street, and had a full view of the Tombs in our
                        face—a splendid prospect. My father's name was Harry Ryer, and mine is
                        precisely the same. All that I know of my parents is, that my father and
                        mother kept a small grocery, or groggery, and that they were nearly always
                        drunk. They quarreled often, and both of them used to lick me like Old Nick.
                        This was done to make me a good boy, I was told; but it did not turn out a
                        very useful thing in that way, for I never was either a good boy or good
                        man. My father and mother would fuddle themselves, arid then turn round and
                        fight each other. Well, when I was very small, the rowdy boys who used to
                        come to our grocery, delighted in getting me drunk, so that, when I was six
                        years old, I could drink any quantity of whiskey and rum, and smoke pipes
                        and dance break downs, and so forth. I was a lusty little fellow, and was as
                        hard as nails. At ten, I could whip everything of my age on the Points, and
                        was considered a very promising youngster. Well, then, I went out with
                        papers, and soon acquired a taste for becoming a fireman, and used to get
                        drunk nearly every night. I soon found newspaper selling too unprofitable an
                        employment, so I turned porter at eighteen, and was strong and commanded
                        good wages; but I was not to be relied upon for punctuality, because I would
                        repeatedly go off and get drunk. They soon discharged me. I then worked as a
                        porter down at the ferries, drove a hack, or worked on a steamboat. I then
                        married a young Irish woman, named Polly Maguire, she was a faithful good
                        creature, but could not endure my bad treatment, late hours, and the cruel
                        beatings to which I subjected her. We had a child—a boy; but, thank God, it
                        died! the same day, too, that my mother died of delirium tremens; and my
                        father soon afterward out his throat. I became a reg'lar loafer. I would n't
                        work. All I would do was, engage for a few shillings, or a promise of drink,
                        to make up one for an election muss. Yes, I certainly did the public some
                        good by attending fires. One morning I returned at about three o'clock, and
                        I found Polly up, ironing away. It was a hot night, and she stood there,
                        almost falling from exhaustion, having been at work since five in the same
                        morning. I had no pity for her, nor consideration. She chided me, poor
                        thing, and I, monster as I was, grew irritated and quarrelsome, and ended by
                        striking Polly, so that she fell, and then I kicked her ferociously. There
                        she lay, bleeding from her throat, and I struggled into bed, and snored
                        away, unconscious of having killed my wife. But the next morning came, and
                        when I went out into the room, and saw what I had done. I knew not what to
                        do, where to run or go. We lived down a cellar in Frankfort street, and I
                        was soon in the custody of a police officer, and under examination before a
                        police captain, then before an alderman, and ultimately before a judge of
                        the sessions. The counsel, who was provided for me by the fire company of
                        which I was a member, succeeded in proving to the jury's mind that I was
                        insane, the result of which was, that was discharged. I then loafed around,
                        and became a kind of pauper in my fire company. I
                        retained all my strength and vigor. I became acquainted with some fellows,
                        and I then went to house-breaking. This was at for about two years, and made
                        considerable money, but spent it as fast as I could, and laid about, wallowing in my stupid love of drink.
                        During the two years that I was at housebreaking, I had several tussle with
                        the police; but, by——, I never knew the policeman that was strong and
                        powerful enough to take me. Well, then, I went to canaling and boating, and
                        this I enjoyed most deliciously. The summer I spent on the water, and the
                        winter in port, among the girls, fighting, loafing, and drinking. I then
                        made a journey with a menagerie, which was bound for the Southern States;
                        and when I got as far as Mobile, in the State of Alabama, I left them, and
                        went on the steamboats. I felt myself getting less addicted to drinking, and
                        more attached to gaming and pleasure than ever. After which I started for
                        California, and I became a porter at a hotel. Here I drank largely and
                        freely, and then, getting into a row with a man at the bar of a California
                        hotel, a fight ensued, and I strangled him, and left him for dead. I was
                        pursued by a band of citizens, and making a desperate rush, I escaped.
                        Finding a steamer leaving for the Isthmus, after concealing myself for a
                        night, we got under weigh, and here I arrived. I fell in with Mat, and now I
                        am one of the Derienni: and that, boys, finishes my story."
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  THE ATTACK UPON—CHAGRES—THE DEADLY AFFRAY—THE DEATH OF MAJOR
                     PEARSON—THE DAUGHTER AS A HOSTAGE.
                  A special messenger having arrived at the cabin of the Derienni, with a
                     request, or an order, for six of the party to go down to Chagres, as an attack
                     was to be made upon the house of Major Pearson, who was an exceedingly rich
                     person, and who had irritated the Derienni by making overtures to the wealthy
                     citizens of that city, for forming a powerful armed force, to put down this
                     system of Isthmus plunder and robbery, and to bring to punishment the
                     miscreants who kept the whole country in fear, and made the roads as much a
                     terror to the traveler as a forest of wild beasts of prey. These desperate men
                     were so combined, that it was impossible for a weak party to cross their
                     dangerous path. Hence, it became necessary to travel in immense numbers, which
                     was inconvenient, and attended with considerable delay. Gus. Randall and Pete
                     only were left at home, to protect the house and their stronghold. The other
                     six men went forward on their way, and managed to arrive in Chagres by night,
                     and so stealthy were they, that not a word was known of the arrival of any
                     strangers in their small, irregular, wooden city. The major's house was on the
                     outskirts of the place. As the doors were not locked—no such precaution being
                     considered necessary, the Derienni soon found an easy ingress, and access all
                     over the frame house. There were twelve men engaged in this affair, and eight
                     more were engaged in a similar affair at the same time, in another part of the
                     city. They had been collected from the four various points of the Derienni's
                     rendezvous. They did not anticipate a resistance; but, as an alarm might be
                     given, they thought they would go well armed with men. At a given signal, the
                     party took possession of the house, and stationed sentries all around, four in
                     number, and several at the thresholds; and so they proceeded with the greatest
                     care and caution. A party, to the number of twelve, proceeded to the sleeping
                     apartments. They bound the several female domestics, but, much to their
                     delight, they did not find a single male, so they made sure of an easy
                     conquest. Upon the Derienni reaching the large sleeping apartment of the Major,
                     they were surprised to see him up and dressed, and his daughter standing beside
                     him, with his rich nut-brown locks hanging in confusion around her snowy brow.
                     Her face was very pale, but was relieved from ghastliness by two small circles
                     of color, of about the size and hue of delicate roses, on her cheeks. She was
                     much agitated, and held in her hand a splendid small pistol, which she seemed
                     more disposed to throw away than use. The room was occupied by seven gentlemen,
                     armed, some with rifles and bayonets, others with revolvers, swords and
                     cutlasses. This was a desperate sight for the Derienni, who did not expect such
                     a terrible resistance; when, no sooner had the door opened, than the citizens,
                     prepared for the rush, fired upon the pirates as they were entering. Wounds
                     were plentiful, but nothing serious happened. The Major took the command; and,
                     as the apartment was very large, and led to another by which the 
                        assasins
                        assassins
                      had entered, there was a fair field for battle. The struggle was hot
                     and strong. Single-handed combats and cross-firing were kept up for nearly half
                     an hour. Two of the victims lay upon the floor. The windows were shattered in
                     their frames, and the walls and every piece of furniture, were perforated with
                     shot. The major shouted out of the window—"Boys, scour the grounds," when the
                     door of a barn suddenly opened, and several men rushed out, armed to the teeth;
                     and the sentries of the Derienni, who thought their occupation was merely a
                     sinecure, in a moment had to fight for their lives. As the citizen volunteers
                     were evidently getting the worst of it, notwithstanding that the Derienni on
                     sentry in the garden had made a rush up stairs, being less in number by fifteen
                     than their opponents, this brought the numerical strength to the side of the
                     defending party. But it availed them not, for the Derienni fought with their
                     usual bravery and fearlessness, while the opposing party were not prepared for
                     so fearless and bloodthirsty an attack. The major was engaged with Cal, a
                     Derienni. The former was a tall, powerful, fine-looking gentleman of about
                     fifty summers; but the latter succeeded in getting him down, and ran a long
                     dirk into the brave man's heart, who did not even groan or wince. His daughter
                     no sooner saw this, than with a desperate nerve she pulled the pistol, and
                     before Cal could draw breath enough to raise him from his position, kneeling,
                     as he was, over the corpse of the major, a ball had entered his neck, and he
                     rolled over, and, with a heavy force, fell upon his face, gave a deep groan,
                     tried to raise himself up, fell again with still heavier sound, and died. The
                     fighting was desperate all around, and several lay upon the ground, bleeding
                     and groaning. A rude hand caught the major's daughter by the waist, and
                     carrying her a great distance, to where the Derienni had their mules, brought
                     out a mule, a man following in the wake. The two, by sheer force, lifted her
                     upon the beast, one mounting by her side; and Roda Pearson, half fainting and
                     insensible, was riding away, with an assassin as
                      an escort, to the Derienni's cabin. But fifteen of the band survived
                     this dreadful attack; and twenty-two of the citizens was all that survived. The
                     Derienni retreated irregularly until the whole party were back again. The last
                     man who left was Mat; but so accomplished a pirate was he, that, although
                     wounded, he would not leave the spot, until he had possessed himself of the
                     deceased major's money, and, with one of the enemy's guns, he battered in the
                     safe door—a rudely-constructed affair—and possessed himself of a large sum of
                     money. We mentioned that another section of the Derienni had gone off to
                     another place. They went to, an American commission and forwarding house, but
                     encountered no great opposition. They made the best of their way to their
                     quarters, and arrived there in advance of their friends, with their booty. Such
                     a night, so fruitful in its gains, was, nevertheless, a sad affair for the
                     band, and sadly did they feel it.
                  It is morning. The cabins are all filled; but there is no joy nor festive
                     occasion; no laughing; no light and happy faces, as name after name is
                     mentioned, and old companions are known to be dead. But there is a new and
                     strange feature to this den, since last we saw it. There sits, crouched in the
                     corner, a most beautiful girl, whose face is innocence and charity. Oh, what a
                     companion is she to those sanguinary and criminal faces who swarm around her.
                     Her heart is nearly broken; her sobs are loud; her shrieking wild, and her
                     grief is heart-rending. She mourns the loss of a father, whom she saw cut down
                     by her side. She tried to save his life, but success was not hers; she only
                     avenged his death. The Derienni plied her with food, but she would neither
                     accept food nor consolation. For two days after her being first brought into
                     the log hut, she neither slept nor ate, nor tasted of anything but water.
                  
                  For satisfaction, we will state that the major was prepared for an attack upon
                     the Derienni, but not by them. That afternoon, he had collected all the men and
                     cattle under his roof, for the purpose of scouring the country in search of
                     these scourges of the Isthmus. But accidentally going up to the top of a very
                     high turret, he observed the Derienni approach the city. He knew it was them by
                     their swift and rapid riding; none else ventured beyond a mere walk or canter.
                     He came down, and arranged his men, part of them—the most part—in the barn, the
                     fewer with him up stairs; wishing to receive the party with open arms, at his
                     own residence, which he instinctively felt sure they were about to attack, for
                     he was their known enemy. It is a pity that so noble a design was not to be
                     attended with success; but the major was disappointed in his supporters, they
                     being undisciplined and raw men.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  RODA—JOE'S STORY OF HIS LIFE—THE PROPOSAL—THE ESCAPE—THE
                     EXECUTION OF A TRAITOR.
                  Miss Pearson was lodged in one of the out-buildings to the log cabin which was
                     fitted up with all the comfort that the Derienni could possibly furnish to the
                     apartment. At night, the weather being warm, the men paraded the grounds around the buildings, in
                     order to keep watch over their fair hostage. Hank had brought the young lady
                     away with no special purpose, but it was decided by the Derienni that she
                     should be kept as a hostage. They expected that a truce, rather than an attack,
                     would be the result of her being held, as the citizens would naturally expect
                     that, if any force was used toward the Derienni, they would retaliate by
                     putting to death Miss Pearson. She had never spoken since she had been with
                     them, and had not even asked for anything, save of the old negro cook. The
                     extra members of the band had retired to their old quarters, and this left the
                     cabin with the same number of male inhabitants that it possessed when we first
                     introduced it to the reader. We have already spoken, in terms of faint praise,
                     of Miss Pearson's beauty. Her pensive look added a charm to her very beautiful
                     countenance, and her silence lent a holy influence to the young girl. She sat
                     on a low seat, occasionally, among the banditti, but did not join any of their
                     affairs by word or look; and it was gratifying to notice that they did not
                     insult her by carousals or bacchanalian feasts. In the course of one of their
                     evening sittings, Mat called upon Joe for his life; to which he replied that he
                     supposed an apology would not be received. The boss nodded as though he had
                     guessed aright.
                  "Well, gentlemen," said Joe, in a clear and manly voice, "her goes for
                  
                     "THE LIFE AND VICISSITUDES OF JOSEPH S. BARTON,
                     "Your humble servant.
                     "I am a native of Ohio, I was born within a mile of Sandusky city. My folks
                        were in the farming way, and had made considerable money by laying out their
                        once splendid farm in village lots; for part of the city was built upon the
                        estate. I went to school in due course, and received every kind of
                        preferment that could be bestowed upon a youth. I was considered a very
                        excellent scholar, and my parents, who were staunch old-school
                        Presbyterians, had determined upon making a clergyman of me. I went to
                        Harvard, and proceeded well, both in my theology and general education. My
                        character was considered unimpeachable; and my parents looked forward to my
                        introduction, or installation, into a pulpit, with hope, and expectation of
                        my leading in that serious and splendid mission. I went to the city of
                        Boston, to study under a theologian of great celebrity; and at the church
                        where I used to attend, I became acquainted with a beautiful girl, who used
                        to sing in the chorus."
                     Here Joe looked down, and hesitated to go on, when the boss said,
                     "Joe, go on boy; keep her full, and, by——, go ahead."
                     Joe felt encouraged by the peculiar language of their nautical leader.
                     "We became very much acquainted," said he," and, in fact, I loved her with
                        my whole soul. She was indeed a beauty; so serene and lovely that I felt
                        myself grow better and happier in her society; till, at length, she grew
                        sickly. The color left her rosy cheeks, and her rich, full, mellow, ruby
                        lips became parched and dry. I observed all these stages of decay growing
                        upon her. She became a blighted flower, and King Consumption marked her for
                        his victim. The winter came, and the snow reflected upon her cheeks. She was
                        lividly pale. The church had no more charms for me, I grieve to say it,
                        since Lilla had ceased to sing in it. The psalms seemed indeed without
                        melody, when her voice was missing. I looked upon her successor as a
                        veritable usurper of her position. Till one day Lilla laid herself upon her
                        snow-white pillow, and went to sleep, but never woke again. My poor, poor
                        Lilla had gone to the home of spirits—the abode of angels and rest!
                     "When I learned that Lilla was dead—for I was insensible for many weeks—I
                        became reckless. Upon several occasions I attempted suicide, but was
                        hindered in my designs upon my life. I became a gay fellow. I mixed with
                        some medical students, and soon became as dissipated a character as I had
                        previously been a moral one. I spent all the money my father gave me, and
                        was finally expelled from studies by my reverend tutor. My father soon came
                        down; but, alas! how changed was he in his manner. He soon learned the tale
                        of my depravity from my countenance, in spite of all I could urge. He
                        entreated me to return home; but I was so dearly attached, so indissolubly
                        bound to my idols, that I could not leave them. Ultimately, my father cut
                        off my supplies; and, desperately placed and circumstances as I then was, I
                        was prompted by the evil within me to commit forgery. I drew out a note, and
                        signed it with a splendid imitation of my father's signature, for two
                        thousand dollars. I took it to a banker's, with whom my father occasionally
                        did business, and it was paid. When it came to my father's ear, the incident
                        distressed him, but he paid it, and my crime was known only to him. Being a
                        first-rate book-keeper, I found little difficulty in procuring a good
                        situation, at a good salary. I pleased my employers well, and there can be
                        no doubt that, had I conducted myself in a proper manner, at this time,
                        instead of being a member of the Derienni, I should have been one of the
                        prosperous firm of Meredith, Pratt & Company, in Broad street, Boston.
                        But, having contracted a heavy debt for a mistress of mine, for some jewelry
                        and silks, I knew not how to get out of it; so, in an evil hour, I once more
                        forged. This time it was a note upon the firm. I expected this would be
                        unknown, as my first year's salary, of one thousand dollars, would be due
                        before the note, which was only for five hundred and twenty dollars, became
                        due; but it was destined to turn out differently, for the note was
                        negotiated, passed into other hands, and I lost sight of it altogether. The
                        day came, and I was arrested. The firm did not desire to convict me, but a
                        sense of duty compelled them to make an example. I was thrown into prison,
                        but I came out a much worse character than I had gone in; there was no
                        separate confinement then in jails. As I was coming out of the prison walls,
                        I was met by a man, whom I knew not, who shook me by the hand, and asked me
                        whether I was named J. S. Barton. He took me to his house, and treated me
                        very generously. I was surprised at all this, and could not fathom his
                        motives in paying me such generous attention. He supplied me plentifully
                        with money, and I once more dressed in style; and although I could not mix
                        with my old companions, I was, nevertheless, well satisfied with my
                        position, so much better was it than I could have dared to hope for. In
                        about a fortnight more, he said to me that he was a counterfeiter upon a
                        large scale, and that he had men scattered over the Union, to whom he sold
                        bad notes. He then took me under ground, and showed me his apparatus. He was
                        an engraver of the best kind, and his success at counterfeiting was beyond
                        detection. He told me that, as I understood forging signatures, he would transfer
                        that branch over to me, the only one in which he occasionally failed, and
                        would give me half what he had in the world, and half his profits. I should
                        mention that all the persons he had here were ourselves and an old lady, his
                        own mother, who was in perfect ignorance of what her son did for his living.
                        I was very successful in the business, and our affairs went along most
                        prosperously; till, about a year afterward, the police became aware, by some
                        means we could not determine, of our operations, and as we were one night
                        working in our shop under ground, we were alarmed by a rush to the door,
                        which we, confident of our security, had left carelessly ajar. A rush was
                        made by four police. They came, two to each of us, and we were, after a
                        brief resistance, beat, and dragged off to the police station; but not
                        before I succeeded in throwing into the face of one of the officers, the
                        contents of a bottle of oil of vitriol, which was standing upon the bench,
                        and which we used in our business. The officer's eyes were burnt out of his
                        head, and his face was a chawed, crisp circle of blackness. I felt
                        horror-stricken at the deed I had committed. We were tried, convicted, and
                        sent to the state prison of Massachusetts for a period of three years each.
                        When we came out again, my companion and I betook ourselves to New York
                        city, where, with the aid of an exchange broker, supposed by the world to be
                        a highly respectable, moral and religious member of society, we once more
                        carried on a successful career of counterfeiting; until our place was broken
                        into one night in our absence, and every thing smashed; but, gaining scent,
                        through a friend, we did not return, but took to a retired neighborhood. The
                        California fever broke out about this time, and my friend and I thought it
                        would not be a bad spec' to counterfeit steamboat passage tickets. This was
                        a very profitable game, until it was exposed by some of the newspapers, and
                        then it blow'd up. We were pursued hotly by the police, and I took steamer
                        for Panama, whither I arrived, and then fell in with the Derienni.
                     "This, as far, boys, as I know; but God knows what may be the termination of
                        my career, as I am only twenty-seven years of age now. I hope to God that
                        there may be some change! for, great rascal as I have hitherto been, I
                        believe that I shall yet live to do penance for my great crime, in having
                        caused the breaking of my mother's heart, and the ruining of my parents'
                        domestic hearth."
                     
                  
                  
                     Roda listened with varied emotions to the life of Barton, now of pity, then
                        of sorrow, anon in anger, then in contempt and fear. That night a vile
                        proposal was made to the young lady, which we would not repeat, lest it
                        might offend the ear; but it is sufficient to say that the contaminating
                        influence of such society was lost upon Roda. No, rather let us say that her
                        religion and chastity were established upon a firmer basis than before; her
                        love of goodness was more solidly rooted in her heart.
                     The Derienni harkened with pleasure to the recital of Joe Barton's story;
                        but Mat broke in upon their reveries by saying:
                     "Gentlemen, prepare; we're off to the road in half an hour from this. Joe
                        and the Spaniard will do duty at home to-night. Boys, stand by."
                     There was a movement directly. Mules were brought out, arms loaded, clothes
                        put on; and all being ready for a start, Mat gave a whistle. The Derienni
                        jumped into their saddles, and were off like a whirlwind.
                     
                        
                     
                     
                     Roda, left alone with Barton, spoke the first word of conversation that had
                        escaped her since she had been a prisoner in the cabin.
                     "Sir," said she, "I have listened with pain and anguish to your story. I am
                        sorry for you; and when, once more, I get back into the world, I shall pray
                        for your reformation. Why do you not leave these horrible men? oh why?"
                        asked she, in an imploring tone.
                     "I can not," he answered. "If I were to go back into the world, I should be
                        a still worse criminal than I am;" and Joe's manner seemed to undergo a
                        change, while conversing with the fair Roda.
                     Here there was a pause, when Joe, looking up, said:
                     "Would you escape?"
                     "Why do you ask me?" said his fair companion.
                     The Spanish member of the Derienni lay sleeping while this conversation was
                        going on; but if he had been awake, his utter want of knowledge in the
                        English language would have left him in as profound ignorance as his heavy
                        sleep enwrapt him.
                     "Would to Heaven that I could!" murmured the girl.
                     "You shall. Follow me, softly; softly, mind, or you will alarm the Spaniard,
                        and perhaps our old colored fellow, the cook. Can you ride?"
                     "Yes," gently replied Roda, evidently astonished at this strange freak in
                        the robber's career.
                     They then went to a barn, and Barton led forth a splendid mule, which, by a
                        circuitous route, he brought to the summit, when Roda mounted. The night was
                        soft and gentle, chaste and grand, and the girl, like a caged bird scenting
                        the air of liberty, longed to fly to her native home. She said to Joe:
                     "Farewell! God will reward you for this act. I can not sufficiently thank
                        you nor reward you."
                     "In another hour I shall be a dead man," said Joe, forcibly.
                     "How!" asked his companion, her eyes streaming with tears of pity.
                     "The Derienni punish traitors with instant death."
                     "O, let me then return," said Roda.
                     "No, no," said he, hurriedly. "Keep straight ahead, and go on. Good bye. May
                        God preserve you!" and, with a bounding step, he hastened down the
                        circuitous path to the cabin.
                     Roda looked up, and hesitated whether to go on or not; but, at length, she
                        started the mule, and the faithful beast seemed to make light of his
                        bargain, and sped on with more than his usual fleetness; and Roda was soon
                        in her own house. She retired to her bed, without awaking the domestics; but
                        she could not sleep, for her mind was wandering in thought—now here, now
                        there—till, at length, fixing her mind upon her deceased parent, she gave
                        vent to her feelings in a torrent of tears.
                     The Derienni had fallen in with some travelers, who were encamping for the
                        night, and whom they succeeding in robbing of a large stock of clothes,
                        bedding, provisions, etc., but of little money or merchandise, as they were
                        adventurers to the gold regions. They returned to the cabin, and Mat, seeing
                        Joe in a study, he immediately asked where the gal was.
                     "Gone," laconically answered the other.
                     "Escaped, by——," shouted the party.
                     Joe then stood up. He said—
                     "Fellow Derienni. I was touched with remorse and pity at the poor girl's
                        position. Her virtue was jeoparded among us, and my better heart told me we
                        had better let her go; so I gave her my mule, and she is, ere this, in the
                        house of her father. I know my punishment; it is death. I am prepared to
                        meet it. The review of my own career, as told by me, has made me sick of
                        myself, and hate life. So, do your duty;" and Barton calmly resumed his
                        seat.
                     Then followed a short consultation and arguing; but Mat called Joe. He
                        said—
                     "We do n't like to make a target of you, Joe. You have been a good fellow,
                        and a faithful man; though this last act will undoubtedly sew up the
                        Derienni. Another day may see our best men food for ravens. The gal is sure
                        to blow upon us. Suppose we give you money, will you leave us, and not
                        inform?"
                     "I will not promise," said Joe.
                     "Then," said Mat, authoritatively, "he must die; and the sooner it is over,
                        why, the better for him and the rest of us. Joe, you are the last man whom I
                        thought would turn informer."
                     "I am none," replied he; but I desire to die at peace with my God, and end
                        at once this valueless life of mine."
                     The men then walked around to an open place; and Joe Barton, kneeling upon
                        one knee, after shaking hands with his old companions, cried aloud—
                     "May God forgive you for your sins! May this sinful soul be accepted of
                        Christ!" and then, folding his arms, he cried,
                     "Fire, boys, and together."
                     Then followed the rattle of several guns in rapid succession, and, Joe
                        Barton lay pierced with many balls.
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  THE PLAN—THE ATTACK UPON PANAMA—THE RETREAT—THE CAPTURE—THE
                     EXECUTION.
                  The Derienni, in as various branches, heard of several organizations which were
                     raising, for the purpose of driving them from their stronghold. They knew that
                     a coup de main could alone save them. They
                     felt that the end of their successful career was drawing near. Their only hope
                     for the present, then, was in destroying the band which was equipping itself
                     for the work of extirpating the Derienni from the fruitful scene of their
                     labor, the grand highway to the gold regions. Mat, in a council of war, decided
                     that all the men should make an attack upon the quarters of the committee of
                     public safety, as it was called, where the men and arms were located; and,
                     thought they, if they could succeed in routing their antagonists for the
                     present, before another and more formidable army could be raised against them,
                     they would have the means of escape opened to them. This course was then decided upon; that their whole
                     force, which now numbered twenty-six, having lost many and received some few
                     additions, should meet in Panama, and take the committee depot by surprise, on
                     the Tuesday of the next week.
                  The death of Joe was more painful to the minds of the men than all the blood
                     they had spilled, separately and collectively; and those pleasant evenings
                     which they enjoyed were forever departed, and the Derienni locked around them
                     with fear and distrust of each other.
                  Once more the powerful and daring band are together. They rise in their
                     saddles, proudly and nobly; their steeds paw the ground as though they were
                     impatient for the fray. The men are equipped in their peculiar and picturesque
                     manner, and are plentifully supplied with arms and ammunition, concealed
                     beneath their blanket cloaks. At a given signal, they start off in their 
                        full full
                        full
                      force, having just met, from various points, by appointment, and dash
                     along over the almost impassable roads with a speed quite bewildering. Their
                     eyes roll with watchfulness; their eyebrows are knit, and their hands upon
                     their stilletoes, ready at any moment for action. They approach the city in
                     compact mass; and as the population did not exceed five thousand, and it was
                     night, dark as pitch, they had no difficulty in reaching the front of the depot
                     of the citizen soldiery without any alarm. The time was about nine in the
                     evening. They were sitting in a large room, playing at cards, when one of them,
                     observing a number of men riding about opposite the building, gave the alarm to
                     his fellows, who readily understood that this was intended to be a surprise. In
                     another moment the hot shot was pouring in upon them from the street. They made
                     faint return, and this emboldened the Derienni, believing that their opponents
                     were weak; but the facts were, that a few were keeping up the fire, while the
                     balance were preparing themselves for a grand onslaught. As many had betaken
                     themselves to the barns at the rear, and were saddling their beasts, a buckling
                     on of swords, a shouldering of all sorts of muskets went briskly on, and in
                     another moment the Derienni saw at least thirty well-equipped men facing them.
                     They were obliged to turn their attention to this new force, and they desisted
                     from firing at the windows; they engaged with the new comers; but their old
                     adversaries now were quietly at the casement, picking out their marks among the
                     Derienni, and doing more damage than the cavalry. The noise of firing and
                     fighting brought out the residents from the more crowded avenues; they returned
                     for their guns and revolvers, and soon were on the spot, engaged with the work
                     of death. One by one the men and their mules fell; till, at last, a retreat was
                     made by one of the Derienni, for the first time since they had been a band; but
                     now, so far as valor was concerned, it was not dishonorable, for their blood
                     stained the streets, and many of their opponents' carcasses were laying in the
                     confusion of war and carnage around them. Others soon followed, and then after
                     them, with a wild shout of victory, followed the citizens. The chase was
                     carried on for more than an hour. Several of the Derienni escaped; others were
                     shot in the retreat. A ball struck Mat's shoulder, and disabled him from
                     continuing his course. He was captured and brought back. In another minute,
                     Hank's mule was shot under him and he was overpowered and captured. Gus Randall
                     was the last one who gave in; his mule, weary and tired, refused to go further,
                     and he took to his heels; but he was soon turned back, and brought into Panama,
                     a prisoner. The three who were captured, Mat, Hank, and Gus, have been
                     introduced to our readers before. The two former have given their lives in
                     their own language, while the latter has been cursorily alluded to. He was a
                     rough and hardened villain, a native of Baltimore, and, while there, one of its
                     most feared characters. He was the author of many fires and other crimes; and
                     he had this night fought with more energy than any of his fellows. He had dealt
                     death and wounds around him with an unsparing hand, and his retreat was one of
                     the hardest and most destructive to his pursuers.
                  At length these three terrible fellows were made captives. They were placed in
                     the same room from whence they received their first fire. The safety committee
                     is organized, and are keeping them company; such is the primitive state of
                     justice in our more southern latitudes. Cigars and drinking are the order of
                     the night, and the committee do all they can to make their captives
                     comfortable, until their death follows upon the following morning. The
                     remainder of the men are engaged in picking up the corpses and few wounded men,
                     and arranging the former for burial. Bonfires are lighted before the hotel, as
                     an emblem of success; and the place seems all hilarity, at having successfully
                     met the desperate band, whom they thought was more numerous.
                  Early in the morning the committee room is filled with townspeople, eager to
                     catch a glimpse of the three terrible Derienni; till, at length, at about
                     twelve o'clock in the day, it was decided that the execution should take place
                     in the street, in front of the depot. Mat entreated that they might be shot,
                     instead of hung, and this was granted, after much cavil and talk. The men were
                     brought out, and a circle was formed, which was very difficult, for the people
                     would rather have had the ferocious pleasure of tearing them piecemeal, than to
                     have summarily dispatched them by shooting. But the committee did its duty, and
                     although it was an execution by lynch law, yet no sentence could have been more
                     satisfactorily carried out than this was. The Catholic priests were present,
                     but the three men refused any spiritual assistance, and died as they had lived,
                     full of wickedness, awfulness and crime. The citizens fired in great numbers
                     upon the men, so as not to prolong their sufferings; and after the immense roar
                     of some dozen rifles, the mangled corpses of the three men were carried to a
                     retired spot, and there interred.
                  To live the life that these wretches did was bad enough; and to die without one
                     spark of contrition in their hearts, or one prayer upon their lips to their
                     God, may be called fortitude or fearlessness, but it is the fortitude of
                     demons.
                  That day was a day of much rejoicing in Panama, for, towards the night, two
                     others were shot. These were the negro cook and the Spaniard, who were in the
                     cabin when Roda escaped. The others escaped by the Chagres river, it is
                     supposed; but, as robberies and murders are not unfrequent in those parts, even
                     now, we rather incline to the belief that they still inhabit the same log hut
                     of the Derienni in their prosperous days of crime

                              "What boots it on the lineal tree to trace,
                              Through many a branch the founders of our race,
                              Time honor'd chiefs, if in their right we give
                              A loose to vice, and like low villains live?"
                           
                        
                     
                     Grovenor I. Layton, the subject of this memoir, was born in the beautiful
                        village of N——, on the west bank of the Hudson river, in the state of New
                        York, May 7th, 1821, of highly respectable parents. From his earliest
                        infancy a precocity of intellect was manifest in him, which was allowed
                        extensive range by his fond parents, who spared no pains or expense to fully
                        mature and develop every faculty. Under such genial auspices he thrived and
                        grew to the age of seventeen years, when his fond parents, after much
                        thought and deliberation, determined to make an M. D. of him. Having arrived
                        at this sage conclusion as to the future course and destiny of their hopeful
                        son, the next thing to be taken into consideration, was to find a suitable
                        disciple of Esculapius who would undertake the task of teaching him the
                        healing art. Such a thing, however, was not very difficult, as the wealthy
                        have but to mention their wishes and desires to have them gratified. Among
                        all the M. D. 's in N——, and there was a goodly number, none had attained
                        such a high standing as Doctor McK——e. He was a man of great erudition, who
                        after graduating at one of the first medical schools in New York, had
                        visited England and the continent, and studied under Sir Astley Cooper, in
                        London, Ricord, in Paris, etc., and had returned to the United States full
                        of medical lore, and established himself in N——, some ten years previous. To
                        this gentleman Grovenor's parents applied as being the most proper person to
                        carry out to the letter their wishes and desires concerning the future prop
                        of their house. The doctor loving his profession beyond measure, fully
                        agreed with Grovenor's parents, that the science of medicine was the noblest
                        of all the sciences, and undertook the task of teaching him the science with pleasure. This being
                        settled, Grovenor was at once installed as a student of medicine in the
                        doctor's office, and introduced to the pharmacopoeia, the study of which
                        soon enabled him to compound pills and potions. Then followed,
                        consecutively, all the studies relating to the nature and cure of all
                        diseases "that flesh is heir to," and the rules for prevention and cure.
                        Grovenor having a precocious intellect, as we said before, soon mastered the
                        fundamental principles of medicine, and at the expiration of two years had
                        progressed so rapidly that it was deemed advisable by his parents, being
                        seconded by the doctor, to send him to the New York Hospital, that he might
                        have "the ocular proof" of what he had learned in "the books," and also
                        attend the medical lectures before the faculty. Accordingly, every thing was
                        arranged for his journey to New York, and his introduction in the Hospital,
                        etc. It was also arranged, that, as Grovenor had never been in the great
                        city, he should make the house of a physician, a friend of both his father
                        and Doctor McK——e, who resided in Fourteenth street, his home whilst in the
                        city. It was a bright and shining day in autumn, the sere and yellow leaves
                        were just beginning to fall from the trees they had so beautifully decked
                        with green a few weeks previous, a fresh and healthy breeze fanned the
                        cheek, imparting a healthy glow; all nature seemed animated and joyous with
                        renewed life, and there was hurrying to and fro in hot haste as the daily
                        steamboat from Albany for New York was telegraphed above N——, and a motley
                        crowd were gathered on the pier, waiting, with feverish impatience the
                        arrival of the steam palace that was to convey them to the Empire City.
                        Among that motley crowd were four persons we have mentioned before, viz:
                        Doctor McK., Mr. and Mrs. Layton, the parents of our hero, and Grovenor
                        himself. This was the day fixed upon for his departure, and they were there
                        to see him off, and bid him a short farewell. Soon the boat made the pier,
                        and cast out her gang-plank, when a crowd rushed ashore, and another rushed
                        aboard. The last shake of the hand was then given to Grovenor by his
                        friends, the last word of advice was whispered in his ear by his fond
                        parents, smothered sighs were choked down, floods of tears were dried up by
                        the, application of white linen handkerchiefs, the gang-plank was drawn
                        aboard, the pilot's engine bell was rung, the steam was let on, the wheels
                        began to revolve slowly, the boat moved majestically out in the beautiful
                        bay like a thing of life, and soon N——, was left far astern. At first
                        Grovenor was inclined to melancholy, but this soon wore off, and gave place
                        to pleasant thoughts, as the beautiful scenery on either bank of the noble
                        and majestic Hudson river claimed his attention, filling him with wonder and
                        awe. Thus he spent the remainder of the day in a half dreamy reverie,
                        contemplating the sublime and beautiful works of nature and nature's God,
                        until the boat arrived at her pier, foot of Barclay street, New York. 
                           
                              "The cold, heartless city, with its forms
                              And dull routine; its artificial manners,
                              And arbitrary rules; its cheerless pleasures,
                              And mirthless masquing."
                           
                        
                     
                     New York! How many bosoms have swelled with rapture, how many cheeks have
                        blushed with shame, how many hearts have been filled with joy, and how many
                        have sunk in despair, at the sound of the magic name of New York! New York!
                        Well! There is no doubt that New York is the heart of the United States,
                        that the different states are its arteries, that the issue of its ventricles
                        gives the prevalent tone throughout the western continent, and that
                        therefore the pulse of this mighty republic is influenced, if not indeed
                        governed by its action. But viewed as it is without reference to its
                        external influences, what a mass of all that is vicious, pleasing and
                        repulsive, horrible and honorable, pious and profligate, brutal and
                        beautiful, philanthropic and ferocious, artful and amiable, slavish and
                        tyrannous, credulous and skeptical, solemn and absurd, superficial and
                        profound, correct and corrupt, convivial and cold, impudent and difficult,
                        soft and subtle, atrocious and true, cruel and confiding, satanic and
                        sincere, heartless and benevolent, crafty and covetous, craven and
                        courageous, despotic and obsequious, virginal and voluptuous, contemptible
                        and venerable; in fine, what a mass, what a chaotic mass of all that is good
                        and bad, admirable and abominable, with all the varied shades which
                        intervene, does this mighty heart of New York present. Nor is it the heart
                        of the republic only, it is a world of 
                           istelf
                           itself
                        ; a world in which all existing feelings, motives, passions, and
                        propensities are to be found in perfection developed. The first appearance
                        of New York strikes a stranger with amazement, let him enter at which point
                        he may; and more especially effective is it if he should enter in the
                        evening. It was evening when Grovenor arrived, and as he had to go in a
                        carriage from the foot of Barclay street to Broadway, and thence through
                        Broadway to Fourteenth street, the blaze of the light by which he was
                        dazzled, the noise of the various vehicles by which he was deafened, the
                        magnificent stores which he beheld, with the myriads of human beings
                        streaming on either side as he advanced, had their effect of inspiring him
                        with wonder. Where could the people be driving to? What object had they in
                        view? Upon these questions when they suggested themselves he had not time to
                        dwell. The motives by which they were actuated were as various as their
                        forms; misery, hope, joy, pride, vanity, crime, love, relaxation and
                        revenge, respectively impelled them on; but of this at that time he knew nothing. The
                        merchant, who had just achieved a great commercial swindle which would stamp
                        him a good man for life; the items man, who had been walking all day,
                        sustained only by the hope of an accident, praying that some important
                        personage might fall and break his neck, that some atrocious murder might be
                        committed before his eyes, or that some destructive fire might burst out as
                        he passed, and thus enable him to dine at Mercer's or Sweeny's on the
                        morrow; the clerk who had just given notice to leave, in the full conviction
                        that his "firm" could not get on without him, a mistake of which he would
                        have the proof practically soon; the tradesman who had a bill for two
                        hundred dollars due on the morrow, and had not ten dollars to meet it; the
                        little boss manufacturer, who had been running after money all day, and
                        could not catch it, and who for the sake of being a boss worked eighteen
                        hours out of the twenty-four, for a far less sum than he might earn by
                        working ten hours without all this anxiety, as a journeyman; the pompous
                        actor, the envious author, the heartless lawyer, the accomplished thief, the
                        unprincipled gambler, the gaudy cyprian, and the haggard milliner, the poor
                        but honest man, the highly respectable because wealthy rogue, passed on
                        alike, for Grovenor viewed them only in the mass, without reference to their
                        virtues, their vices, or their cares.

                                 "Look to the players; see them well bestowed:
                                 They are the abstract and brief chroniclers of the times."
                              
                           
                           SHAKSPEARE
                        
                     
                     Arriving at Dr. W. 's residence, he was cordially received by the doctor and
                        his lady, who were expecting him. After tea the doctor was called out
                        professionally; and his son Robert—a young man about the same age as
                        Grovenor—proposed a walk, which was agreeable to Grovenor, as he had been
                        sitting nearly all day. Leaving the house, they walked out Fourteenth street
                        to Broadway; and then sauntered along, arm in arm, down the west side of
                        Broadway, till they arrived opposite the Broadway theatre, when, seeing the
                        front of the theatre brilliantly illuminated, and a crowd pressing in,
                        Robert proposed going in, too—seeing that Grovenor had never been in a
                        theatre before. The proposition pleased Grovenor, so they obtained tickets
                        and went in. Everything was new and strange, and Grovenor's eyes
                         roamed about the house, taking
                        in everything from pit to dome. He was bewildered, dazzled and amazed, by
                        all he saw. Soon the orchestra collected, and began to discourse most
                        beautiful and eloquent music. The bell rang, and the curtain rolled slowly
                        up, accompanied by the stamping of feet, clapping of hands, and cries of
                        "Hey! hey! hey!" by the turbulent portion of the audience.
                     The play was "Othello, the Moor of Venice"—one of the most affecting of all
                        the tragedies written by the great dramatic author, William Shakspeare. When
                        the persons who represented the character of the villain Iago, and his dupe
                        Roderigo, made their appearance on the boards, and the representative of
                        Iago commenced to embody and unbosom that which was most within him,
                        Grovenor watched every look and gesture, and listened to every word uttered
                        with breathless eagerness, and often were the flood gates of "the fruitful
                        river of his eyes" hoisted, and his tears flowed copiously, as the tragedy
                        progressed in interest. And well might he, a verdant youth, be affected; for
                        where is the man—I care not be he a stoic, cynic or philosopher—that has
                        ever witnessed the playing of that celebrated tragedy, and not been
                        affected, by it more or less; as there "the mirror is held up to nature,
                        showing virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and
                        body of the time his form and pressure."
                     When the green curtain had fallen at the conclusion of the last scene of the
                        last act of the tragedy, Robert said that as there was to be an intermission
                        of some fifteen or twenty minutes before the commencement of the afterpiece,
                        they had better go out and take the air; and he led the way to the
                        vestibule. Here they saw a crowd hurrying up stairs to the saloon. Robert
                        then told Grovenor if he would be discreet, and say nothing to the old
                        folks, he would show him a contrast to what they had just witnessed.
                        Grovenor promised secrecy, and Robert then led the way to the upper saloon.
                        The sight that greeted their vision here was indeed a painful contrast, and
                        is a disgrace to the age. To his amazement, Grovenor saw some thirty young
                        women, of different orders of beauty, dressed in the gaudy flummery of
                        fashion and fancy shops, their attire embracing all the hues of the rainbow.
                        Many of them with cigars in their mouths, others drinking intoxicating
                        liquors at the bar, and joking, laughing, and talking obscene language;
                        others were bustling about among the crowd of both old and young men,
                        importuning them to treat them, (the young women,) at the bar, or buy them
                        fruit, confectionery and pastry, sold by a woman standing behind a counter
                        at the north end of the saloon. Grovenor looked, doubted, and looked again,
                        on the motley crowd before him, and could scarcely believe what his own eyes
                        saw. Could it be possible that all those lovely-looking young women were
                        cyprians, wantons, commoners, outcasts from the pale of society? he asked
                        Robert. It was scarcely to be believed, and yet Robert assured him that such
                        was the fact. They moved on in the crowd, and anon some one of the gaudy
                        cyprians would mark his verdant look, and putting on what would be intended
                        for a most captivating smile, would ask him to treat her; but he being
                        instructed by Robert, would politely decline the honor, etc. They moved on
                        to the southern end of the saloon, where they noticed one of the gaudy
                        cyprians sitting alone by herself on a settee, lost in deep, pensive
                        thought. There was something about her very look, that spoke louder than
                        words, that she had seen better days, that she had not as yet become
                        callous, indurated; that the garb of licentiousness ill became her. Grovenor
                        and Robert were both transfixed to the spot for a few minutes, with wonder
                        and astonishment, at beholding so much loveliness embodied in a single
                        individual. She was indeed a beau ideal
                        for a Venus: in stature about five feet four inches; hair black as a
                        raven's, and flowing in a profusion of curls down her alabaster neck; eyes
                        dark and brilliant, which sparkled like stars; forehead classically massive,
                        showing the moral and intellectual predominated over the animal; nose a very
                        little inclined to the aquiline; cheeks like twin roses; ears small; lips
                        neither too thick nor too thin, but in perfection developed; teeth like
                        pearls; chin neither round, long nor oblong, but beautifully proportioned;
                        neck like a swan; skin fair as parian marble; and a bust rivaling the Venus
                        de Medici; in fine, take her all in all, she was the most beautiful female
                        either of them had ever beheld. No wonder, then, they were both transfixed
                        to the spot at beholding so much loveliness. She had already risen, and was
                        on the point of removing herself from their presence and steady gaze, when
                        Robert spoke, in a bland tone, and requested her to be seated again, whilst
                        he took a seat beside her, and motioned Grovenor to do the same. He then
                        asked her, in a kind tone, a few questions relative to her name, age, where
                        she was reared, how long she had followed the abandoned career, etc., etc.
                        She looked steadily at him for a few moments, to assure herself that his
                        questions were asked in a spirit of kindness, or whether they were mere idle
                        interrogations; but, at the expiration of a short time, she appeared
                        satisfied that his was not an idle curiosity, she commenced and told him the
                        sad tale of her wrong.
                     "My name is Irene," said the beautiful fallen. "I was born in the beautiful
                        village of A—, in the Mohawk Valley, and am just seventeen years old the
                        present week. One short year ago I was innocent—the joy, pride and comfort
                        of my fond and indulgent parents.
                        
                           "But alas! the cruel spoiler came.'
                        
                     
                     "At that time a young man, who was head clerk in a large wholesale dry-goods
                        house, in Maiden Lane, came to our beautiful village to collect moneys due
                        his employers, and transact other business. I became acquainted with him at
                        a party, soon after his arrival there. He had a most pleasing exterior and
                        insinuating address, which fascinated me from the first moment I saw him;
                        and I being young and unsophisticated, having no knowledge of the world,
                        foolishly believed all and every word, every vow and profession of love he
                        made; and in an evil hour, when wrought to the highest pitch of frenzied
                        love, I became his victim, under a solemn promise of marriage. But he kept
                        procrastinating the celebration of our nuptials, under this and that
                        specious pretext, until the time came for him to return to New York, when he
                        persuaded me to leave father, mother, and everything that was near and dear
                        to me, and come with him to New York, where he would make me his bride in a
                        short time. Well, I, poor simpleton believed that, too, and fled with him;
                        but, instead of making me his wife, he consigned me to the keeping of Madame
                        W——, in Mercer street, where I have remained since. Thus you have a synopsis
                        of my painful history," said Irene.
                     It was, indeed, a painful history, and affected both Robert and Grovenor to
                        tears; and they both hated and despised the villain clerk who had plucked so
                        fair a flower from the beautiful country garden, and brought it to wither
                        and die, contaminated with the vitiated city air. The afterpiece being
                        finished by this time, and the house nearly empty, Robert and Grovenor left
                        the theatre, and returned home, moralizing.
                     The next day Grovenor commenced his studies at the hospital, where he won
                        many honors. He had been there but a few weeks before he became acquainted
                        with many young men, who took it upon them to "form" him, and learn him "the
                        ropes," as they were pleased to term the corrupting and vitiating of
                        unsophisticated nature. Among that number was a young man by the name of
                        James Jones, the son of a respectable and wealthy merchant, who had brought
                        up his son James as most boys are brought up—with a slight infusion of
                        religion, administered in weekly doses, and a wavering code of ethics,
                        enunciated and illustrated in a random and somewhat contradictory manner.
                        When his father died, James found himself at the head of a thriving
                        business, which he detested, and in possession of a good round sum of money,
                        which he did not class in the same category as his business. Gifted with a
                        jovial and genial humor, great animal spirits, and the audacity of a
                           parvenu, he very quickly "realized," i.
                        e., disposed of his business, and commenced his merry career; and, at the
                        time he became acquainted with Grovenor, he was what is known in New York as
                        one of the "fancy." The following are the appellations by which he was
                        usually distinguished: "A good fellow," "a jolly dog," "a knowing card," "a
                        regular brick," and a "loose fish." He had managed, while spending immense
                        sums, to make acquaintances and learn experience, which enabled him, when
                        all was spent, to turn his acquisitions to advantage, and make them support
                        him. James knew everything, and could do everything, that a man about town
                        is expected to know or do. He was unequaled at billiards, strong at whist
                        and eucher, adroit at faro or hazard, great in culinary and cellar
                        knowledge, knew New York as well as his alphabet, and, as he expressed it,
                        "could give the most knowing a wrinkle or two upon some point or other."
                        James had always some new acquaintance—or rather, let me say, some
                        inseparable friends—whom he introduced into the glories and pleasures of
                        "life." This friendship was inviolable as long as the young man's funds
                        lasted; but as soon as the silly gull began to request repayment of loans,
                        or to lower himself in James' eyes by retrenchment of his expenditure, then
                        James was suddenly called away from the city for a few weeks, or discovered
                        some splendid young fellow who really never allowed him a moment's leisure,
                        and thus he would "cut" his dupe. It was Grovenor's misfortune to make the
                        acquaintance of this dissolute and unprincipled young man, who, in the garb
                        of friendship, practiced upon his unsophisticated nature, and undermined
                        little by little the moral and religious principle that had been infused
                        into him from early infancy by his fond parents.
                  
                  
                     CHAPTER III.
                     
                        
                           
                              "No man can be a great enemy, but under the garb of a friend. If
                                 you are a cuckold, it is your friend only that makes you so, for
                                 your enemy is not admitted to your house; if you are cheated in
                                 your fortune, 't is your friend that does it, for your enemy is not
                                 made your trustee; if your honor or good name is injured, 't is
                                 your friend that does it still, for your enemy is not believed
                                 against you."
                           
                           —WYCHERLY.
                        
                     
                     It was a beautiful night in early June; myriads of stars glittered in the
                        dome of heaven's high concave, and shone like a multitude of beacon lights
                        of glory in the blue-black of eternity; the silvery moon, pale-faced
                        Cynthia, wandering Luna, or whatever people may choose to call her,
                        promenaded the self-same path pointed out to her from the beginning of
                        creation; gentle zephyrs fanned the cheek, and countless numbers of bipeds
                        were promenading that great artery of the Empire City, Broadway. Among the promenaders lounging along
                        arm in arm, intent upon no particular thing, were Grovenor and his new
                        acquaintance and friend James Jones. It is curious to notice what an
                        influence, either for good or ill, some minds exercise over others. The
                        minds of men are as various as their forms; and superior intelligence,
                        whether it be pure or prostituted, has its votaries. It was so in this case.
                        Jim Jones was a man of the world, and as such knew the most vulnerable point
                        in Grovenor's composition, which he attacked assiduously, but not overtly;
                        so that at length Grovenor became fascinated, aye, infatuated with him, and
                        looked upon him as an oracle. Having had a surfeit of promenading, Jim
                        proposed calling on Irene, the beautiful fallen, whom Grovenor had seen at
                        the Broadway theatre some weeks previous. Grovenor at first peremptorily
                        refused going, but soon the sophistry of Jim brought him around, and he
                        consented to be led there, although his conscience rebuked him for so doing.
                        Turning down Grand street, they soon came to Mercer street, up which they
                        went a short distance, when they arrived at the residence of Madame W——.
                        Ascending the steps, Jim gave three light taps at the door, which was soon
                        opened by a huge negress, who, scanning their features, and recognizing Jim,
                        admitted and showed them into the parlor, where they saw Irene. She was
                        looking particularly well. A flush of animation gave a tint to her cheek,
                        and additional fire to her dark eyes. In her raven hair a string of costly
                        pearls were woven; large glittering bracelets encircled her well-shaped
                        arms; and a black satin dress set off to perfection her handsome bust, which
                        was lavishly displayed. She was seated on the sofa, propounding some
                        humanitarian question, when the two were announced. She rose graciously, and
                        received them with the finished grace of a Lady Blessington. The room was
                        garnished with immense mirrors, reaching from the washboards to the ceiling,
                        while sofas, ottomans, lounges, and divans were displayed in copious
                        profusion—all of which quite dazzled Grovenor. Jim ordered champagne; a
                        bottle was brought in, drank, and then another ordered, and still another.
                        Irene's conversational powers were brilliant, and brilliantly did she
                        display them. The champagne, and the delicious poison that Grovenor drank
                        from Irene's eyes, soon acted as a stupefying opiate to his reason, a dreamy
                        languor stole softly over him, and * * *. The next morning Grovenor awoke
                        with an aching head and heart; he rubbed his swollen eyes with his clenched
                        fists, and gazed wildly about, hardly conscious whether it was some horrid
                        dream, or a damning fact that he had taken the first false step. The stupor,
                        however, soon wore off, and he became fully conscious, and sensible of the
                        painful truth that he was in a brothel, and had passed the night there.
                        Conscience, that inward monitor, sternly rebuked him for his sin and folly.
                        Filled with tormenting thoughts, he arose, made his toilet, and hastened
                        from the spot, with the haste of a pursued criminal, and resolved never to
                        associate with Jim again. Well would it have been for him had he kept the
                        resolution, but his mind was too weak to resist the temptation of seeing Jim
                        once more, that he might tell him his opinion of him, and then separate from
                        him for ever. That meeting was had, and it sealed his doom, for Jim by his
                        sophisticated reasoning fully exculpated himself from all blame in the eyes
                        of Grovenor, who became more infatuated than ever.
                     A few weeks after the events just narrated, Grovenor and Jim were again
                        promenading Broadway, seeking for some amusement; arriving opposite the
                        Park, they strolled listlessly through the grounds, when Jim proposed going
                        to a billiard room in Park Row. After a little persuasion, Grovenor allowed
                        himself to be induced to go, and they crossed over to the place pointed out
                        by Jim. It proved to be a gambling house, as well as billiard saloon, as
                        will be seen by the reader anon. They knocked at the door, and after a
                        scrupulous examination on the part of the porter, who did not at first
                        recognize Jim, no one being admitted except when introduced by a frequenter
                        of the house, they ascended to the gambling room, where they found rather a
                        numerous assembly. There were three tables. That in the centre was the most
                        attended; it was the rouge et noir table.
                        That on the left was devoted to roulette; that on the right to hazard. There
                        was a low hubbub and confusion of voices, above which rose these sounds,
                        "Make your game, gentlemen," "The game is made," "Seven's the main," "Red
                        wins." Grovenor approached the centre table, and was instantly made way for
                        by the lookers on. At the side centre sat the dealer, before him two packs
                        of cards placed together, beside him two croupiers. Opposite sat two
                        croupiers, and a man who collected and shuffled the cards. Piles of gold,
                        bank notes, silver and ivory counters, were glistening on the tables, enough
                        to awake the spirit of gain in the most prudent breast. It was a most
                        painful sight. The features of the players were distorted by anxiety, those
                        of the dealer and croupiers had become hardened into masks more hideous in
                        their sodden calmness than agitation could have made them. Painful also the
                        contrasts afforded by the players. Some were reckless, others calculating;
                        some were feverish in their impatience, others lost in quiet despair small
                        sums which to them were fortunes; while several passed hours together,
                        pricking a card with a pin, and trying to wrest the secret of the capricious
                        goddess, by counting the turns of the wheel, and then after as much
                        calculation and patience as would if directed to any honest employment have
                        produced a tangible result, hazarding their solitary dollar, and losing it
                           in astonishment and dismay.
                        Seedy, withered men were also there, whose whole existence depended upon
                        their trivial gains, who nightly risked their few shillings, content to
                        retire with a few shillings' gain which they took home to their wretched
                        families, and if they lost, content to abide the loss without further risk
                        that night. There was one man there who bore the unmistakable marks of a
                        gentleman, in spite of the worn, anxious face, and seedy dress; he was never
                        known to miss an evening, and never to play more than four coups on each
                        evening. His stake was invariably one dollar, and it was rare indeed that he
                        did not win three coups out of the four, timing his stake with such
                        knowledge of the chances. With the two or three dollars he thus gained he
                        supported a wife and six children. Is there not something singularly
                        distressing in such an existence? To struggle nightly with the capricious
                        turns of fortune for a miserable pittance, and to gain that, too, by
                        consummate self-mastery! Yet there are men who choose such a life, rather
                        than one of honorable labor; men who have mastery enough over their passions
                        to be cool at the gaming table, yet not sufficient mastery to
                        keep from it! This would be inexplicable, did we not know the
                        powerful attraction of all exciting uncertainty, did we not recognize the
                        inherent desire for emotional excitement which is implanted in every heart.
                        In honorable labor such men have not learned to seek their excitement; they
                        find it at the gaming-table, and hence the fascination of gaming. It is to
                        be noted, in confirmation of what has just been said, that inveterate
                        gamesters are thoroughly aware of the enormous disadvantage at which they
                        play, thoroughly convinced the bank must win—yet they play.
                     The scene was new to Grovenor, and affected him painfully, as it always does
                        those who are not carried away by the infatuating passion of gaming; but he
                        was there, and Jim persuaded him to try his luck, as he would be sure to win
                        the first time. So he surmounted his disgust, inwardly resolving that
                        whatever might be the fortune of that night, he would never repeat the
                        experiment. The room was singularly quiet, considering how many persons were
                        assembled. The sounds of bottles being uncorked, the clatter of glasses, and
                        the chink of money, were distinctly audible, conversation being carried on
                        for the most part in whispers. Grovenor played. Jim, trusting entirely to
                        the good fortune which so proverbially favors beginners, abstained from
                        giving him any advice. He played at random—lost. Twenty dollars were soon
                        gone. He took out fifty dollars more—all he had with him—they followed the
                        others. As the last dollar disappeared, Grovenor saw a young man heap
                        together a pile of notes and eagles: huddling them m his pocket, he called
                        for some champagne, and having drank it, disappeared. He came down stairs at
                        the same moment with Grovenor and Jim, in high spirits. "That's what we
                        ought to have done," said Jim. "Why did you force me to play," said Grovenor
                        bitterly, like all weak men, throwing the blame of his own folly upon
                        others. "Who the deuce would have supposed you would lose the first time?"
                        said Jim. "Well, it is a bit of experience," said Grovenor; "perhaps I have
                        bought it cheap after all." He walked home, however, as angry as if by no
                        means so satisfied with the bargain. He was restless that night. It was long
                        before he went to sleep, and when he did fall into a fitful doze, he was
                        troubled by strange dreams of the gaming table. Sometimes he was playing
                        with a pile of notes before him, sometimes he had lost every shilling, and
                        awoke in despair, to find himself in bed.

                                 Famine is in thy cheeks;
                                 Need and oppression stareth in thy eyes;
                                 Upon thy back hangs ragged misery;
                                 The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law.
                              
                           
                           SHAKSPEARE.
                        
                     
                     It was a sultry day in August, 1844, and the sun was pouring down from a
                        cloudless heaven intense rays on the main street of N—g. There was a burned
                        odor in the atmosphere, arising from the scorched pavement, and rayed forth
                        from the garish brick houses. Silence and noonday heat reigned over the
                        scene. The deep and portentous stillness was brought out into stronger
                        relief by the occasional whine or bark of some lonesome canine, or the
                        rumbling of a solitary dray over the macadamized road. Only a very few human
                        beings dotted the street, here and there, at wide intervals. Two ladies,
                        hot, dusty and demure, were shopping. High up the street three or four
                        ragged urchins were plotting mischief, or arranging some boyish game. A
                        proud, young, and blooming mother, apparently about eighteen summers, was
                        dandling her infant at a shop door, as if desirous that the whole street,
                        "as well as the rest of mankind," should be aware of the important fact of
                        her maternity; for sure there never was such a charming baby before! To one
                        a stranger, merely casting his eyes down that street, nothing could appear
                        more lifeless, more devoid of human interest, more uncheckered by the
                        vicissitudes of passion. It had the calm of a desert almost, without the
                        grandeur. In such a place the current of life would seem monotonously placid, existence itself scarcely
                        better than vegetation. It was not so, however. To those who inhabited the
                        place, it was known that beneath the stillness a stratum of boiling lava was
                        ever ready to burst forth. Every house was really the theatre of some rude
                        comedy, or of some grotesque tragedy. The shop, which to an unfamiliar eye
                        was but the depository of retail goods with John Smith as retailer, was, to
                        an inhabitant, the well known scene of some humble heroism or ridiculous
                        pretension.
                     To the eye of the person who now leisurely paced the street, the town was
                        dull and lifeless, because it had not the incessant noise of a capital, and
                        because he knew nothing of the dramas which were being enacted there. Yet
                        even he was soon to learn that sorrow, not loud but deep, was weeping
                        ineffectually over a tragedy which touched him nearly. He was a young man of
                        about twenty-three years of age, with the unmistakable look of a gentleman.
                        As he passed her, the proud young mother ceased for a moment to think only
                        of her child, and followed with admiring eyes his retreating form. The echo
                        of his quick, hurried tread, rang through the silent street, and soon he
                        disappeared, turning up towards a large house which fronted the river. He
                        knocked at the door, which was soon opened by the servant with great
                        solemnity. "How are my parents to-day?" said Grovenor, for it was he. "Low,
                        very low," said the nurse whom he had addressed; "the doctor has just left,
                        and he says they can't possibly survive another day." This was sad tidings
                        for Grovenor; and he sat down, buried his head in his hands, and cried like
                        a child. Only the day before had he been advertised by letter that his
                        father and mother were lying very low with the small pox, and wished him to
                        hasten home immediately if he wished to see them before they died.
                     Immediately on the receipt of the sad intelligence, he hastened to leave New
                        York by the first conveyance, and had just arrived at home, where the
                        melancholy tidings was confirmed, but too truly, as we have just seen.
                        Having relieved his heart some what from the heaviness that was pressing
                        upon it, by a copious flow of tears, he aroused himself and visited the sick
                        room, where lay the dear authors of his being. It was a heart-rending sight.
                        There lay his fond parents, their forms emaciated, their sunken eyes far in
                        their sockets, their faces covered with red blotches, and apparently
                        lifeless. This dismal sight melted him to tears again, which flowed fresh
                        and fast, when he frantically threw his arms across them, and begged them to
                        speak to him once more; but they heeded not his request, for they were too
                        far gone to know anything.
                     All that day, and through the still and silent watches of the night, did
                        Grovenor watch with them; and when the day broke, it found their spirits
                        departed to a better world, and him lying at full length upon the floor, in
                        deep mental agony.
                     The nurse came into the chamber of death as soon as the day dawned, and
                        finding him, gave the alarm, and soon the physician and others were in
                        attendance. Grovenor was removed from the room, and the two inanimate forms
                        that lay placid in death, were properly laid out in solemn state. Three days
                        after, Grovenor followed the twain to the tomb; and as the last spade-full
                        of earth was thrown into the grave, he burst into tears, threw himself
                        frantically on the grave that contained all that was near and dear to him,
                        and fainted. Well would it have been for society and for himself, had he
                        never recovered. If such had been his end, then we would not have been
                        called upon to write this memoir; nor would so many have been sent,
                        unprepared, with all their sins upon their heads, before the great Judge.
                        But of that anon. He soon recovered from the swoon, and returned to his now
                        desolate home, full of sorrow.
                     About two weeks after the burial, Grovenor was waited upon by a smiling,
                        smirking lawyer, who informed him that several of his clients, who were
                        creditors of his father, wished to have their claims settled. A thorough
                        examination of his father's papers, books, & c., was then gone into, and
                        the result of that investigation showed that his father had died
                        insolvent—i. e., that by reason of speculations that Grovenor knew nothing
                        about, his father had become so deeply involved that the whole of his
                        property, when sold, would not pay half of his indebtedness. True it is that
                        troubles never come alone; one calamity generally follows in the wake of
                        another, as though one misfortune is not enough to visit upon humanity at
                        once, but another must needs follow to keep the first company. Such is life,
                        however, and we must submit to the chastening rod, whether we will or no.
                        Grovenor was not prepared for this last blow; therefore it bore most heavily
                        upon him, and made his life almost a burden too grievous to be borne.
                     The hounds of the law came and laid sacrilegious hands upon every thing,
                        which they advertised for sale at public vendue. The day of the sale came,
                        and with it a motley crowd, and Grovenor had the mortification and misery of
                        seeing one thing after another sold to the highest bidder, till all was
                        sold, and he was a beggar. This virtually threw him in the slough of
                        despond, and 
                           
                              "Melancholy
                              Sat on him like a cloud along the sky,
                              Which would not let the sunbeams through, nor yet
                              Descend in rain and end; but spread itself
                              'Twixt heaven and earth, like envy between man
                              And man, and was an everlasting mist."
                           
                        
                     
                     
                     His hopes, desires and aspirations, one and all being crushed by the events
                        of the last few weeks, and every tie that held his native village near and
                        dear to him being severed, he left it with disgust, and returned to the
                        great city without hope or aim. The second day after his return to New York,
                        as he was walking listlessly through the battery grounds, he chanced to fall
                        in with Jim Jones, who expressed great joy at seeing him once more. Seating
                        themselves on a bench in the shade, where the cool breeze blowing across the
                        bay fanned their brows, Grovenor commenced and gave Jim a full and succinct
                        history of all that had befallen him. They then rose from the seats they had
                        been occupying, and started for a stroll. "Jim," said Grovenor, as they
                        walked on, arm in arm, "I am going to ask you a question which generally
                        disturbs friendship, but which won't alter ours, because you'll answer it
                        candidly." "Grovenor, I know what that exordium means. Whenever a man begins
                        in that solemn, circumlocutory manner, he can have but one object—money."
                        Grovenor laughed, as he replied, "You have hit it, by George!" "Of course, I
                        have. Do you think I have borrowed so much money without learning every
                        symptom?" "Well, then, Jim, without disguise, I want to borrow a few
                        dollars." "Make it shillings, Grovenor, and it will be quite as impossible.
                        Egad! it is rather a queer sensation for one who has been so long a borrower
                        to be looked upon in the light of a possible lender." "Say no
                        more, you would do it if you could, I am sure." "Dog my buttons! if you are
                        so sure of it, I'm not. I doubt whether I could lend. I don't
                        know the trick of it; I should feel as strange and disreputable as if I were
                        to pay a bill. Perhaps my friendship for you might overcome that; I don't
                        know; perhaps it might. But it is all speculation, so let us trouble
                        ourselves no more about it. As a matter of practice, judge how feasible it
                        is, when I reveal to you the present state of my finances—four shillings and
                        five cents, in good and lawful money as the lawyers say."
                     Seeing the hope of getting any assistance from Jim was futile, Grovenor left
                        him in front of the Astor House, and hastened to call upon those who had
                        professed themselves his friends but a short month before. But he met with
                        no better success. They were all sorry, very sorry, but just at that
                        particular time they were very short of funds, and referred him to Mr.
                        So-and-So, as the persons most likely to be able to accommodate him, etc.,
                        etc. Such cold, heartless comfort did he receive from his professed friends,
                        one and all. Not one of them would lend him even a paltry dollar. Meeting
                        with such cold, heartless repulses on every hand, he became desperate, and
                        determined to have money some way; and as he could not get it honestly, he
                        determined to get it dishonestly. The very night that he arrived at this
                        wrong and wicked conclusion, he forged a check for five hundred dollars, on
                        one of the principal banks, in the name of one of his professed friends, and
                        the next day, disguising himself as a Quaker, he presented it for payment,
                        when it was cashed without suspicion. This was the first crime he had ever
                        committed, and his conscience rebuked him sternly; but he choked down all
                        sensibility, and smothered every pang with the false philosophy that
                        "necessity knows no law." That night he met Jim at Florence's, where they
                        supped sumptuously, after which they adjourned to the house of ill-fame,
                        where they both became intoxicated with champagne, and Grovenor passed the
                        night in the arms of Irene, the beautiful fallen.
                  
                  
                     CHAPTER V.
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 Where'er the gaming board is set,
                                 Two classes of mankind are met;
                                 But if we count the greedy race,
                                 The knaves fill up the greater space.
                              
                           
                           GAY'S FABLES
                        
                     
                     Ever since the night when Grovenor had first entered that gambling house,
                        and lost there seventy dollars, the image of the joyous winner, huddling the
                        notes and gold into his pocket, had pursued him like a phantom. He had
                        resolved to play no more, and as his first adventure had been so
                        unfortunate, he could not hope hazard would be in his favor. Men have
                        extraordinary practical belief in their own "luck." Ask a man if he
                        seriously theoretically believes in any thing of the kind, and he will
                        answer, No. Yet that very man puts his name down in a raffle, or cuts cards
                        against an adversary, or stakes large sums on any game of chance, "because
                        he always wins," "because he is so lucky." Grovenor believed himself to be
                        "unlucky." He was therefore averse to gambling. He had played, and "it was
                        so like his luck," although the first time, yet he lost. In spite of this
                        conviction, the image of that fortunate winner, with his "pile" of notes and
                        eagles, would force itself upon him. While be was reading, while he was
                        thinking—at his meals, during his walks, while dozing in bed—that figure
                        stood before him, crumpling the notes, calling joyously for the champagne,
                        and sauntering down stairs in thorough self-content. In his imagination he
                        followed that young man through a series of fortunate nights, during
                           which he had
                        amassed large sums, with which he purchased a charming little house in the
                        country, and forswore the gaming table for ever. It was a most coherent
                        story; coherent as imagination loves to be. The real story may be told in a
                        few words. Three weeks after that prosperous night, the winner, utterly
                        ruined, poisoned himself. Had Grovenor known the real story, it might have
                        made him pause; but he only knew what he had seen, and fancy supplied the
                        rest. Like a tempting fiend did the image of the winner pursue him;
                        seductive, irritating, he tried to banish it by thinking of his constant ill
                        luck, but it would return, and his present discouragement made the
                        temptation stronger.
                     "Jim," said he, "I wish you would take me again to Park Row." "What! you
                        want to try another coup?" "Yes; I have a
                        presentiment I shall win. At any rate it is worth risking a few dollars." "I
                        am going there this evening. Dine with me at Windusts, and I will explain to
                        you a coup de main by which we must win."
                        That night they went to the house in Park Row, where Grovenor had first
                        played. Jim won two hundred dollars—Grovenor lost every cent. "Jim lend me
                        twenty dollars, I am desperate." "Here they are, old boy; play cautiously."
                        Grovenor seized them with a greedy clutch. "Make your game, gentlemen," said
                        the dull-eyed dealer. Grovenor threw the twenty dollars on the red. The
                        cards were dealt with leisurely precision. "Apres," said the dealer. The croupiers, in accordance with the
                        laws of the game, deducted half the stakes on the table. "Is that your
                        caution, Grovenor?" whispered Jim. "It is my desperation," he said, between
                        his teeth. "Make your game, gentlemen;" "The game is made;" "Red wins." The
                        perspiration burst from Grovenor's pores; the tightening suffocation in his
                        breast was relieved. He allowed the money to remain in its place, again to
                        take its fortune. "Make your game, gentlemen," said the dealer, in his
                        unvarying voice. "The game is made;" "Red wins." There were now eighty
                        dollars on the red, belonging to Grovenor. "Take up thirty," suggested Jim.
                        "No; hit or miss, I risk all." The gambler's recklessness possessed him; he
                        was in such a state of excitement that he knew not what he did. "Red wins,"
                        again said the dealer. One hundred and sixty dollars were now heaped upon
                        the red. "Shall you keep the stake there, sir?" asked a smiling gentleman
                        with bushy whiskers, who had taken great interest in the game. "Yes," said
                        Grovenor, firmly. "Then I shall back against you," said the smiling
                        gentleman, twirling a whisker around his finger, and throwing a dollar upon
                        the black, with the air of a man undertaking an important enterprise. "Red
                        wins," again said the dealer. "There's a rush upon the red," sighed the
                        bushy whiskered gentleman, as his dollar was raked away, and three hundred
                        and twenty dollars
                         stood there as Grovenor's
                        winnings. "I shall back you this time, sir; you are fortune's favorite, sir.
                        Take a pinch of snuff, sir;" and with recovered hilarity he offered the box
                        to Grovenor, who bowed coldly, and took a pinch. "Make your game,
                        gentlemen," said the dealer. "Try the red again, Grovenor," said Jim, "but
                        take up a hundred to guard against accident." He staked fifty dollars
                        himself on the red. Grovenor followed his advice; he had now two hundred and
                        twenty dollars staked. "The game is made." "Wait a minute," said the bushy
                        whiskered gentleman; "I have not yet staked." He threw down a dollar upon
                        the red. These three were the only players that backed the red. Upwards of
                        five hundred dollars were on the black, and the coup was watched with breathless anxiety. With unimpassioned,
                        inexpressive face, did the dealer throw down the cards, as if all the
                        chances of the game which so excited the players, were powerless upon him.
                        "Red wins," he again said, in his hollow, indifferent voice. Grovenor raked
                        the four hundred and forty dollars toward him in a sort of delirium; the
                        sight of the gold was to him like a vision of fairy land. The smiling
                        snuff-taker snatched up his two dollars, and again requested him to take a
                        pinch. "Pretty game, sir; very pretty, when fortune takes you in hand." "We
                        had better travel now," said Jim. "Not yet." "Yes, Grovenor—come while you
                        have got the money. Don't tempt your luck too far." "I must—I will play
                        another coup. I'll try the red once more."
                        "Do n't! be advised, Grovenor, do n't." "I must. "Well, then Wait till the
                        next. Let this deal go by, and try the next." Grovenor did so. "Black wins,"
                        said the dealer. Jim looked at Grovenor, as much as to say, "you see I was
                        right. "Grovenor smiled. His smiling friend was glum, for he had lost two
                        dollars on the red. He threw down another two dollars again Upon the red.
                        "Back the winning color," said Jim, staking fifty dollars upon the black.
                        Grovenor made a pile of two hundred dollars in eagles, and placed it also on
                        the black. He won again.
                     "Now, Jim, I'm ready to go. Waiter, some champagne, and a cigar, waiter."
                        Grovenor having called for the champagne, placed the gold in his purse, and
                        seemed to have realized his dreams; glimpses of a fortune sparkled on the
                        froth of the wine. His brain was in a whirl, and the chink of the money, the
                        rattle of the dice, the unvarying phrases of the dealer, the brief remarks
                        of the players, all sounded like fairy music in his ears. He was impatient
                        to be gone, for he felt that he was succumbing to the fascinations of the
                        place rightly named a "Hell."
                     As he went to the side table for his hat, he espied his smiling neighbor
                        standing, looking into the glass, with one hand under his chin, fiercely
                        pushing his whiskers forward so as almost to cover his face while with the
                        other hand he made terrific menaces at the reflection of that face in the
                        glass. "Ugh! you old fool," he vituperated his own image, at the same time
                        shaking his fist at it. "Did I not tell you so?
                        Did I not say you would lose? You donkey! you donkey! Ten dollars have you
                        thrown away this blessed night! Ten dollars! Will you never learn wisdom?
                        will you never leave off play? Donkey! fool! donkey!" Grovenor with
                        difficulty restrained his laughter, and advanced saying, "I'm sorry you have
                        not been fortunate, sir." "You are sorry, are you?" fiercely
                        replied the little man, sharply turning round upon him, delighted at having
                        some one else on whom to vent his wrath. "And pray, sir, who are you? Who
                        are you, sir, that presumes to be sorry for me? Am I a donkey, sir? am I a
                        boy? am I a noodle? to be pestered by the pity of a puppy like you? Do you
                        wish to quarrel with me, sir? do you wish to quarrel? If so, say the word. I
                        am not quarrelsome myself—not I; but I am not to be bullied, sir; you shall
                        find that I am not to be bullied. You may try it on, sir; you will find it
                        no go! And since you are determined to fight me, sir, fight you
                           shall. You force me to it, but I am not one to back out of it."
                        Grovenor looked at him a moment, in surprise and smothered anger, but
                        choking down his passion with a desperate effort, he turned upon his heel,
                        put an arm within Jim's, and went down stairs. The little fiery gentleman
                        ran his fingers several times through his whiskers, and then turned again to
                        vituperate his own repentant face in the glass. Having relieved his choler
                        thus, he called for some wine, and left the gambling house for his
                        lodgings—which he never reached alive.
                     After leaving the gambling house, Grovenor and Jim walked as far as old
                        Tammany, when they separated for the night, and Grovenor walked back toward
                        the gambling house, and waited patiently for the little bushy-whiskered man,
                        who had so grossly insulted him. He had not waited long, before he saw him
                        come out of the gambling house, and walk up Chatham street. Grovenor
                        followed stealthily behind him. Arriving at Orange street, the little man
                        left Chatham street, and proceeded up Orange street. When he had nearly
                        arrived at Anthony street, Grovenor approached stealthily, and seizing him
                        by the throat, plunged a large dirk knife into his side, saying at each
                        successive stab, "Take that for your insolence, you old fool! donkey! fool!"
                        Each stab was enough to inflict death, but Grovenor was so excited with
                        passion, that he continued to stab, even after the little man had relaxed
                        the hold he had on his arm, groaned, gasped, and yielded up his spirit.
                        Grovenor then dragged the body into a court or alley, close at hand, where
                        he deposited it, and then walked coolly out to Centre street, thence through
                        Leonard street to Broadway,
                        through which he passed, and soon found himself at his lodgings, when he
                        threw himself on the bed, and passed the night, troubled with dreadful
                        dreams.
                  
                  
                     CHAPTER VI.
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 The lust of gold, unfeeling and remorseless—
                                 The last corruption of degenerate man.
                              
                           
                           DR. JOHNSON.
                        
                     
                     The year 1848 was pregnant with great events; and not the least of these,
                        was the discovery of that bane of man—gold, in California. The golden news
                        reached New York late in the fall, and soon spread to every city, village,
                        and hamlet, throughout this vast republic; causing a greater commotion than
                        any event that had transpired since we had been a free people. "California!"
                        "gold!" was in every body's mouth, from early morn till dewy eve; and
                        thousands upon thousands of adventurous men bade adieu, and left fathers,
                        mothers, sisters, brothers, wives, children, homes, every thing, and started
                        for the El Dorado of the Pacific, the Ophir of America, to reap the golden
                        harvest. O! those were momentous, stirring times!
                     Among the first who took the gold fever, was Grovenor. He became thoroughly
                        intoxicated with the exhilarating idea of digging the precious metal. Gold!
                        gold! gold! was his food—raiment—God. He consulted with Jim, who laughed in
                        derision, and said "It was all gas; he'd not believe a word about it;
                        couldn't fool him; no, no; he was a little too sane for that; and if it were
                        true, he'd not leave a luxurious place like New York, to dig in the sands of
                        California for the yellow boys, when he could get them so easily here—not a
                        bit of it." Grovenor then betook himself to Irene, and painted to her in
                        glowing colors, the pleasures to be derived from making an early start for
                        the new El Dorado. They would amass such "piles," and return to New York,
                        greater millionaires than Astor or Girard had ever been.
                     Irene became as infatuated for the golden harvest as was Grovenor; and she
                        consented to accompany him, as soon as he could raise the funds necessary to
                        defray the expenses of the journey to California. This being settled,
                        Grovenor determined to obtain the money by hook or by crook; and the most
                        feasible way to obtain the money he thought would be to try his hand at
                        forgery again. Accordingly he forged a check for one thousand and nineteen
                        dollars, on a bank, in the name of a heavy jobbing merchant down town; and
                        dressing himself in the garb of a clergyman; with white cravat and gold
                        spectacles, he presented the check, and had it cashed without hesitation.
                        Taking the bank notes he had received at the bank, he went to an exchange
                        office, and got-gold for them. He was now ready for his journey; but Irene
                        was not, neither did she get ready before the spring of 1849; and he was
                        cautious enough to put his money in bank till they were both prepared for
                        the journey.
                     The spring of 1849 came, and found them both ready; and the month of April
                        found them on the briny ocean, in one of Howland and Aspinwall's splendid
                        steamers, bound for Chagres, N. G., where they safely arrived in due time.
                        Landing at Chagres, they engaged boats to take them to Gorgona, at an
                        enormous price; and after great trouble and exposure, they arrived at
                        Gorgona Here they met with new difficulties: mules had to be hired or
                        purchased for them to continue their journey to Panama, where they were to
                        take a steamer for San Francisco, California. After much vexation and
                        trouble, they at length succeeded in purchasing two mules; and hiring a
                        guide at an enormous charge, they proceeded, on their journey. When about
                        half way between Gorgona and Panama, they were attacked by three banditti,
                        known as the "Derienni," who robbed them of their baggage, and took one of
                        their mules. Not satisfied with this, they violated Irene; and then giving
                        Grovenor a severe castigation, they suffered him and Irene to retain the
                        other mule, and proceed on their way; and after much hardship, Grovenor
                        having, to walk all the way, they at length reached Panama, quite
                        exhausted.
                     Here new and unforeseen troubles greeted them. There were more than five
                        thousand persons at Panama, waiting for a passage to San Francisco, and no
                        steamship to take them. So they had to wait a month; and in the mean time
                        Grovenor was not idle, but was extensively engaged in little petty thefts,
                        burglaries, and robberies, to get even with the "Derienni," who had robbed
                        him; though what analogy there was between the merciless "Derienni," and the
                        peaceable inhabitants of Panama, and the honest strangers sojourning there,
                        has not transpired. At the expiration of a month, a steamship arrived, and
                        took about three thousand persons on board, and among the fortunate ones
                        were Grovenor and Irene.
                     After a passage of twenty-six days from Panama, they arrived in San
                        Francisco bay, to the great joy of all on board. The next day they were
                        taken off in boats, and landed in San Francisco What a thrill of pleasure
                        ran riot through every heart of all that immense company, as their feet
                        pressed the soil of the new El Dorado! They had arrived at the goal, and
                        were about to reap the reward due all their toils, privations, and miseries.
                           No
                         wonder, then, the blood coursed rapidly through their veins, and
                        made their hearts beat with rapture. But their toils were not passed; they
                        were only begun as yet, for the ground was to be dug, washed. etc., before
                        they could possess themselves of the precious metal. San Francisco is beyond
                        cavil the world's theatre. There you have people of every nation, the
                        productions of every clime, and the work of every land. This empire city of
                        this truly wonderful state, is destined to be ranked among the great cities
                        of the Union and the world, for its growing importance, its commanding
                        commercial advantages, and the unbounded enterprise of its Citizens. It is
                        situated on the west side of the noble bay from which it derives its name.
                        There, also, is to be found every species of vice, as well as good, that is
                        known in the world—as there the most reckless, daring, vicious, wicked,
                        depraved, and debauched of every land, and every clime, congregate and
                        inhabit.
                     Grovenor and Irene put up at the California Exchange; and after looking
                        around the city a day or two, he concluded that he could make more money by
                        gambling and other nefarious means, than by journeying to the mines, and
                        slaving there for the glittering tinsel. As they were both thoroughly
                        vitiated and depraved now, they were not at a loss to find boon companions.
                        They soon opened a gambling house in Montgomery street, on an extensive
                        scale, where all the thieves, robbers, assassins, murderers, forgers,
                        counterfeiters, etc., etc., found a daily and nightly resort. They kept this
                        "hell" open one year, when they were burned out by the great fire that
                        destroyed more than half of the city; but they were soon in full blast
                        again, in Washington street, on a more extensive scale than ever. Here they
                        carried on their hellish work for nearly a year longer, when an event
                        happened that made the vigilance committee turn their attention to them,
                        which made them leave suddenly, between two days. The cause of this
                        attention on the part of the vigilance committee, was this: A Spaniard, who
                        had just returned from the mines, having some thirty thousand dollars in
                        gold dust in his possession, had been inveigled into Grovenor's house, and
                        being pretty well intoxicated, was induced to play faro, which he did, and
                        quite unexpectedly won three thousand dollars, instead of losing his thirty
                        thousand, as was anticipated. But he had not quite as good luck in getting
                        away from the place, for they robbed and murdered him—as was supposed—as he
                        was never seen afterward. This coming to the ears of the vigilance
                        committee, they determined to arrest Grovenor, Irene, and all their
                        associates.
                     But they got wind of their kind intention, and fled to Benicia, on the north
                        side of the Straits of Carquines, at the entrance of Suisun Bay, where they
                        opened another gambling house, under assumed names. They met with great success in
                        Benicia, for a while, as there is a navy station and arsenal there, and the
                        Pacific Steam Packet Company have erected a handsome dock, where their
                        steamships come up to refit; all of which adds importance to the place, and
                        brings an immense trade.
                     One night after they had been in Benicia about three months, two sailors
                        belonging to the U.S. Marines, were out on a glorious spree, and happening
                        to pass Grovenor's place, the delightful strains of music discoursed by a
                        brass band that he had hired to attract and allure customers, enticed them
                        to enter, which they did, and drinking freely, they became quite
                        intoxicated. They were then induced to play monte at a side table, where a
                        beautiful woman, who was none other than Irene, was dealing. They were soon
                        cheated of all their money, and not being so drunk but that they could see
                        through the cheat, they became infuriated, and commenced demolishing the
                        gaming tables, counter, bar, etc. This created a general row, and in the
                        melee, both were stabbed to the heart, which caused instant death. Soon the
                        news spread throughout Benicia, that a horrible and double murder had been
                        perpetrated in Layton's gambling hell, and an excited and infuriated mob
                        soon assembled to take summary vengeance on the perpetrators of the
                        atrocious deed; but in the excitement of the moment, the villains escaped,
                        no one knowing where or how.
                  
                  
                     CHAPTER VII.
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 The tyrannous and bloody act is done;
                                 The most arch deed of piteous massacre
                                 That ever yet this land was guilty of.
                              
                           
                           SHAKSPEARE.
                        
                     
                     Being warned in time, of the intended visit of the vigilance committee by
                        spies that he had abroad in Benicia, Grovenor and his associates fled into
                        the mountains back of Benicia, where they remained for weeks, almost
                        famished with hunger, until the excitement had blown over, and their
                        confederates in crime had arranged matters for a flight to some part of
                        California where they were not Known. When the excitement had sufficiently
                        calmed to warrant the undertaking, their confederates procured them suitable
                        disguises, and arranged other matters, and they left the mountains, and came
                        down to the bay, some six miles north-east of Benicia, and took passage on a
                        steamboat going up the Sacramento river, to Sacramento City
                     Arriving in that city, Grovenor and his associates gave out that they were
                        just from New Orleans; and after looking about a day or two, they conceived
                        the idea of joining their united capital to open an exchange office and
                        banking house. This being agreed upon, they united their capital, which was
                        some seventy thousand dollars, in gold, and opened a banking house and
                        exchange office, under the firm of Brandon & Co., as Brandon was the
                        name Grovenor had assumed. Their good address, backed by a large capital,
                        gave dignity and respectability to their business, and they soon won the
                        confidence of the whole community, and also of the miners, who came there to
                        sell their "dust," and buy provisions, etc., etc., to carry back to the
                        mines; and thus they did a most thriving business.
                     But honesty was no longer a part of Grovenor's composition; and he soon
                        began to worry, chafe, and smart, like a wild beast confined in his den; he
                        did not feel contented unless he was plotting and executing some dark and
                        terrible deed. So he soon made the acquaintance of a gang of counterfeiters,
                        who were extensively engaged in counterfeiting notes on different banks in
                        the Atlantic states. Among the numerous counterfeit notes he received from
                        the gang, were some ten thousand dollars in fifties on the Bank of the State
                        of Missouri. These he managed to dispose of to the unsuspecting miners, who
                        were returning to their homes in the Atlantic states, in exchange for their
                        hard-earned "dust," paying them at the rate of seventeen dollars per ounce,
                        when other bankers were paying only sixteen dollars per ounce for the dust.
                        This seemingly generous dealing on his part, brought him many dupes, and put
                        over eight thousand dollars in his pocket. It was a most cunningly devised
                        and executed scheme of villainy, and worthy only of the abandoned wretch
                        that he had now become.
                     Not long after the consummation of this extensive swindle, people began to
                        notice the many flash-looking men that resorted daily to this office, and it
                        was soon whispered about that he was no better than he should be. As soon as
                        this breath of suspicion began to float about, a certain man who envied him
                        his success, hired a stranger to take some dust to Grovenor, and offer it
                        for sale, and whilst negotiating its sale, to strive and obtain something
                        derogatory to his character, etc. The plan succeeded beyond the envious
                        man's most sanguine expectations; for Grovenor, not suspecting any thing,
                        bought the dust of the stranger, and paid seventeen dollars per ounce for
                        it, in counterfeit notes on the State Bank of Ohio. This was soon known, and
                        immediate steps were taken to arrest him; but when they came to his office,
                        he had decamped. One of his spies happened to be present when the stranger
                        who had received the counterfeit notes in exchange for the dust, returned to
                        the man who sent him, and he (the spy) soon notified Grovenor of his peril, and thus
                        gave him time to escape.
                     From Sacramento City Grovenor made his way to Stockton, on Stockton Slough,
                        three miles from San Joaquin river, where he went under the name of Rawson,
                        and soon connected himself with a gang of counterfeiters, and undertook the
                        sale of the numerous counterfeit notes they put in his hands. In the short
                        space of one month, he succeeded in disposing of some four thousand dollars'
                        worth of these spurious notes, to the hardy miners, in exchange for their
                        dust; and then thinking he had better leave before his swindling was
                        discovered, he left Irene at Stockton, and went to Tuolumne City, which lies
                        on the north bank of the Tuolumne river, a short distance from its
                        mouth.
                     He remained a short time in Tuolumne City, selling counterfeit notes; but
                        not finding it very profitable, left there, and went farther up the river,
                        to Jamestown, a small mining settlement on Wood's Creek. Here he remained a
                        few days, when learning that some Chilians were digging an immensity of gold
                        at Mormon Gulch, just a little north of Jamestown, he started for the Gulch,
                        resolving to have a share of the precious dust. Arriving there, he found two
                        men and a woman, Chilians, who had a rude cabin erected near where they were
                        digging with might and main. They were able to converse a little in broken
                        English, and Grovenor pumped them until he learned that they had been there
                        four months, and had taken out some ten thousand dollars' worth of the
                        precious metal. This was the kind of news he liked to hear, and he
                        ingratiated himself in their eyes, by every artifice he was so well master
                        of; and they kindly consented to let him join them at digging, and agreed to
                        give him one-fourth of all they accumulated thereafter. Upon these terms, he
                        commenced digging, and worked steadily for a week; but having a surfeit of
                        hard labor by this time, and all suspicion on the part of the Chilians being
                        allayed, he determined to rob his three partners of all their dust, decamp,
                        and leave them in the lurch. To accomplish this, he feigned sickness one
                        afternoon, and retired to the cabin, apparently to lie down, and take a
                        little rest. When he had been in the cabin about an hour, the men sent the
                        woman to take a look in the cabin, and see if the stranger was in want of
                        any thing. Accordingly the woman repaired to the cabin, and there caught
                        Grovenor in the act of breaking open an old chest that contained all their
                        gold dust. She immediately halloed to her companions; but she had not
                        halloed more than three times before Grovenor rushed to the door, and
                        stabbed her to the heart with a huge bowie knife, and she fell, mortally
                        wounded, in front of the cabin. By this time the men came running up, and
                        Grovenor rushed upon them with fiendish ferocity, and stabbed them both
                         to the heart, in quick
                        succession, with the same murderous weapon that he had just slain the woman
                        with. They both fell to the ground, with a heavy groan, and expired; and he
                        then dragged the three bloody corpses in the cabin, to which he set fire,
                        after securing all the gold; and while the cabin was still burning, he
                        started with his booty, over the mountains, for Sonora, where he arrived the
                        next day.
                     As he was entering the town, the greater part of whose inhabitants are
                        Chilians and Sonorians, he attracted the notice of many, who remarked his
                        haggard look, and some spots of blood upon his clothes He passed into the
                        heart of the town, and put up at the best house of entertainment, and told
                        the landlord that he had just come over the mountains, from Murphy's
                        Diggings, in Calaveras county, and had been attacked by Indians, two of whom
                        he succeeded in killing, and made his escape. The story was believed by
                        some, and by others it was not believed. About two weeks after this, as some
                        Chilians were passing Mormon Gulch, they saw the ruins of the cabin, and
                        turning over some of the charred and burned timbers that had not been
                        entirely consumed, they found some human bones; this made them suspect that
                        all was not right, and they began and searched some distance from the ruins,
                        and found the mining implements lying just as they were left by the Chilians
                        when called to the cabin by the cries of their companion. Believing that a
                        foul murder had been committed, they gathered up every thing, and carried
                        them to Sonora, and told what they had seen, and what they suspected.
                     The dreadful news soon spread through the town, and caused great excitement
                        The persons who had seen Grovenor enter the town a week before, remembered
                        his looks, and at once came to the conclusion that he was the perpetrator of
                        the infamous deed; and they at once informed the vigilance committee of what
                        they had seen, and what was their belief. The committee at once had Grovenor
                        arrested, and interrogated him, concerning where he came from, what he had
                        been doing, etc. But he answered them so straight-forward that they were
                        inclined to let him go; and were on the point of discharging him from
                        custody, when a man stepped forth from the crowd and said, that he saw
                        Grovenor in Jamestown some weeks before, and had spoken to him, and told him
                        about Mormon Gulch being a good place for digging gold, as he knew some
                        Chilians who were making their fortunes there, and upon hearing him say
                        this, Grovenor said he would go there immediately, as there might be a
                        chance for him too. Hearing this, the committee empanneled a jury of twelve
                        men, and proceeded to try Grovenor at once. The gentleman from Jamestown,
                        whose name was Wiles, was then put upon his oath, and swore to the facts as
                        stated above. A stranger who had just arrived, then stepped forth and said
                        that he would be sworn too, as he knew something about the matter. Being
                        duly sworn, he deposed and said: that some three weeks before, he was going
                        from Sonora to Pleasant Valley, in Calaveras County, and that he passed
                        through Mormon Gulch, and saw the prisoner there, and then in company of
                        three Chilians, two men and a woman, and that he stopped and talked some
                        five minutes with him (Grovenor) therefore he could not be mistaken in his
                        identity, etc. The evidence was too strong to admit of a doubt in the minds
                        of the jury, so they convicted him, without leaving their seats, and he was
                        sentenced to be hung within two hours.
                     The committee commenced preparations at once for the execution, by fastening
                        a block, through which was run a rope, directly over the middle windows of
                        the committee room, fronting the street. By this time, some three thousand
                        people were collected in the streets, around the committee room, and the
                        culprit was brought to the window and told that if he had any thing to say,
                        he had an opportunity then. Seeing there was no hope, no escape, but that he
                           must suffer the penalty, he said: "For years have I exerted
                        a passionate and reckless life, in a spirit of defiance to all laws that men
                        consider, and reverence as holy. I have been incited by poverty, and the
                        heartlessness of men, to do deeds that 'made heaven weep and all earth
                        amazed.' There was a time, I remember me, when I was innocent, and knew no
                        guile; but a change came over the spirit of my dream, and I turned
                        disdainfully from the beaten paths in which my fathers walked, and followed
                        in pursuit of a phantom which tempted me on with its luring smile and siren
                        song, until its delusions have melted away, and I am to-day confronted by
                        that judgment which I know full well is as certain as human action. I
                        confess, with shame that I perpetrated 'this most arch deed of piteous
                        massacre,' with which I am charged, and for which I am about to pay the
                        penalty with my life. If this were the only crime I have stained my soul
                        with, I might hope to be forgiven; but I have perpetrated so many crimes
                        that I cannot hope to be forgiven, either in this, or the world to come."
                        Here his emotion was great, and his utterance was choked by sobs and groans,
                        so the fatal rope was adjusted around his neck, and he was run up to the
                        block, by a dozen strong men, who pulled the rope into the committee room,
                        and made it fast, thus suspending him by the neck, between the heavens and
                        the earth; and soon that vitiated and depraved spirit of his left its mortal
                        tenement, and departed with all its imperfections, to appear in solemn
                        judgment before the great Judge of all the earth.
                     That the sad end of the felon, Grovenor I. Layton, may be a warning to all,
                        and deter many from taking the first false step, is the sincere
                        prayer of the writer of this memoir.

                  CHAPTER I.
                  The Waldegraves came soon after the pioneers to the Genesee county, N. Y., and
                     settled themselves in that splendid section of the valley known as Livingston
                     county. Mr. Peter Waldegrave—the father of the unfortunate woman whose life we
                     have to record—was the son of a wealthy and intelligent preacher of the
                     Presbyterian persuasion, who bought for his son Peter an immense tract of land
                     on the Phelps and Goodhue purchase, on the banks of the Serpentine and
                     beautiful Caneserago creek. The estate increased in value many times its
                     original price, and even the vestige of it which remained in the hands of its
                     original possessor, was an immense fortune in itself. Peter Waldegrave was
                     esteemed as one of the wealthiest men of Western New York—one of its best
                     citizens, a good father and a highly religious and moral character. His wife
                     was an amiable, religious woman, whose calm, dignified and pious demeanor was
                     the subject of much eulogium and frequent allusion. The parents of Margaret
                     were a pattern of that moral grandeur, youthful enterprise, honesty and
                     benevolence, which characterized the New Englanders who first turned the sod of
                     the sylvan valley of the Genesee.
                  Margaret was born on the 2d day of July, in the year 1825, at Mr. Waldegrave's
                     splendid residence, at the hedge of Lima township, on the Monroe county or
                     Rochester road. The birth of this person will be well remembered by old
                     residents, for it brought a child to the desolate hearth of the father, but
                     robbed him of his wife, Mrs. Waldegrave, who died a painful death while
                     becoming a mother. Who shall say whether Mr. Waldegrave was repaid in receiving
                     a daughter at the expense of losing his fond partner in life—who had struggled
                     with him in primitivism and plenty—who had worked in the forest, and shone as a
                     brilliant ornament in her own drawing room? But enough. Waldegrave was a man of
                     the world; and, as he brushed the tear from his eye with the coarse sleeve of
                     his heavy coat, he mused with himself upon the responsibility of training up an
                     infant in the paths of rectitude and religion. But great as was the task, he
                     felt that it must be undertaken arid carried through. The infant Margaret was
                     put out to nurse, and progressed
                     well under the vigorous motherhood of Hank Meredith's, the wagon maker's,
                     wife.
                  At an early day, Peter Waldegrave looked about him for a teacher or governess
                     for his beloved child. It is not necessary that we should attempt to describe
                     his love. Fathers, you will best understand how a parent will love its only
                     child, and when that babe's face is a reflex of its mother's, and that mother
                     torn from our hearts, a young and blooming thing, and turned into clay.
                  He succeeded, after much difficulty, in procuring the services of a young
                     widow, who resided at Warsaw, in Wyoming county, and was recommended by the
                     clergyman of that village as a sober-minded and religious lady. Her husband had
                     died at sea, while on a return voyage from the West India Islands, whither he
                     had gone to St. Thomas' for the benefit of a severe consumption, but, as we
                     have shown, did not live to return. His widow had since that practiced the
                     profession of governess and in that capacity she was to take charge of the
                     youthful Margaret.
                  Myriam Holmes—for such was the gentlewoman's name—was in her person an elegant
                     and captivating woman, of well-stored brain and serene gentility, and pleased
                     Mr. Waldegrave well, likewise her pupil, who progressed amazingly under her
                     tuition, and betrayed great precocity.
                  When Margaret had grown to be a girl of twelve years, her father determined
                     upon sending her to a seminary, but found himself loth to turn from his door
                     Mistress Holmes. She had won not alone Peter's respect, but his love, for her
                     manners were so interesting; and, moreover, she had long since ingratiated
                     herself into the affairs of the household, and evinced such extraordinary tact
                     and capacity in the management, that Waldegrave ended by offering Myriam his
                     hand and heart, which she accepted, and they were married, while Margaret was
                     sent to Canandaigua to finish the education so hopefully commenced under Mrs.
                     Holmes. The seminary was conducted by Professor J——, whose talents were
                     universally acknowledged, and the institution stood high in the estimation of
                     the public. Here she progressed rapidly, and was not alone the most talented
                     scholar, but one of the most fascinating girls of the school. She became
                     acquainted with a youth named Charles D. Ellas, and often strolled with him
                     through the beautiful walks which encircle the splendid village where the
                     schools of Charles and Margaret were situated—familiarly known to all
                     travelers, being the county seat of Ontario. Charles Was a willful, daring boy,
                     with an eagle eye, a proud lip, and splendid hair, which curled in grand
                     confusion over his lofty brow; he was tall of his age, and was sixteen years
                     old, while Margaret had been at school three years, making her age fifteen. She
                     had been home to her parents at holidays, and no more.
                  There might have been a courtship between these children; but, as our purpose
                     is with the serious side of life, and not with the more trivial tints of a
                     novelist, we merely mention this acquaintance as necessary to the proper
                     development of the history of the extraordinary woman. She was a most perfect
                     beauty. 
                        
                           "Faultless was her form as beauty's queen;
                           And every winning grace that love demands,
                           With mild, attempered dignity, was seen
                            Play o'er each lovely limb, and deck her angel mien."
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  During the time that Margaret had been at school, Myriam became a mother; and
                     now that the girl returned, she found a fine boy of two years usurping her
                     position, as she supposed. Myron—for such was the child's given name—had
                     certainly made the heart of the father glad, but had not worked any change in
                     the love he bore towards his first and eldest child. As for its mother, her
                     conduct was not so meek, nor so loving, towards Margaret, but she played her
                     part well; and this was not apparent to Mr. Waldegrave, who never imagined any
                     change in his wife's or daughter's mind. Without any manifest signs of trouble,
                     there was a dreadful domestic revolution working rapidly in the minds of the
                     step-mother and step-daughter. Myriam viewed Margaret as a barrier to the
                     progress of her son in its father's affections; while Margaret felt that the
                     interest of a young child would make incipient to her father all the ovations
                     and caresses he had formerly lavished upon her. These attentions having been
                     paid her during her growth, she looked upon them as an essential part of her
                     happiness; and thus worked things. After the novelty of home had worn off once
                     more, and these mutual passions and jealousies had become seated, the hitherto
                     happy home of Peter Waldegrave was turned into an abode of trouble, anger,
                     dissatisfaction and hate. That which had been unseen and unwatched by the eye
                     of the father, at length burst out like the burning lava of a mountain, and
                     threatened to scorch and, burn to destruction all within the sphere of its
                     fall. It bewildered him, and he knew not what to do: he was buried beneath the
                     suddenness and weight of his misfortunes, when one morning Myriam, after a
                     lengthy dispute with Margaret, came to her husband with tears in her eyes, and
                     told a tale of bad treatment and insult that she had received from
                        his daughter. While Margaret followed soon after, with her
                     beautiful face flushed with anger, and her large black eyes flashing fire, as
                     she recounted all the contumely that had been heaped upon her by his wife—of
                     her slightings, and how it was her belief that even her father's heart had
                     become estranged. Myriam declared that, if Margaret should stay in the house,
                     it was her intention to leave it forever; while Margaret declared she had
                     become sick of home, and could no longer submit to remain under the dominion
                     and misrule of her step-mother.
                  Many proposals were made, and truces entered into, between the parties, but all
                     to no purpose. No sooner had the first excitement of making up, between the
                     step-mother and daughter, died away, than the feud broke out again with renewed
                     vigor and virulent spirit.
                  Ultimately, after much trouble, discussion, and correspondence, both a
                     profession and a teacher was found for Margaret. It had been decided that she
                     should learn the millinery business, at the fashionable establishment of Mrs.
                     H——, in Buffalo, who was to teach the young lady every branch of the art, treat
                     her as a daughter, and looking both to the religious exercises and intellectual
                     development of the young lady, who was, when learned enough in the craft,
                     to become a partner in Mrs. H.'s highly lucrative business. Her father was much
                     pained to see her depart.
                  Arrived at Buffalo, Margaret was fast ripening into womanhood, and was
                     developing herself a magnificent flower from a promising blossom. Her beauty
                     was dazzling—her voice melodious—her manners agreeable—her intellect
                     fascinating. She was now but eighteen years old, and just the age and the
                     person to become enchanted with the city pleasures.
                  Mrs. H——'s polished manners, and warm concern for Margaret's welfare, endeared
                     them to each other. To an experienced mind, this condescension in Mrs. H. will
                     be easily accounted for, when we take into consideration the wealthy parents of
                     Miss Waldegrave, and her great command of money. Margaret did not remark this;
                     and if she did, she thought it was her fascinations, manners or embellishments,
                     and advantages over the Other young ladies, that placed her so near to the
                     heart and confidence of Mrs. H——. The circumstances of her training, and her
                     recent quarrels, made Margaret an impetuous and passionate, self-willed girl;
                     but her culture enabled her to conceal these things from the observant eye.
                  It may be imagined, that being in business in a great city, boasting of wealth
                     and prosperity, such a charming woman as Mrs. H——, would draw around her a
                     great circle of admirers: this was so—for at this house visited more of the
                     aristocratic male members of Buffalo society, than a millinery shop would
                     otherwise attract. A Miss Bevington was Mrs. H.'s principal assistant; indeed
                     we might say that she managed the whole of the business department—Mrs. H.
                     doing little more than adorn her person with the most fashionable costume, and
                     talking with the ladies, and chatting with her gentlemanly visitors, who would
                     be repeated in their calls, during even business hours.
                  Lydia Bevington was a beautiful creature—tall, dignified and lovely in her
                     person. Her dark hazel eyes were fringed by long silken eyelashes; her cast
                     might be called that of the brunette, for her olive complexion, and her
                     delicately transparent skin, plainly stamped her as one of the darker beauties.
                     She could sing and play superbly, and was an easy, graceful, agreeable,
                     confiding and generous girl. Lydia's age was about twenty; and it was generally
                     remarked that it was strange she did not marry, so many opportunities and
                     offers that she had had. This splendid woman became the councillor, tutoress,
                     and even bedfellow of Margaret Waldegrave.
                  It was remarked that Mr. Florence, the son of an extensive ship-owner, of
                     Providence, R. I., was introduced by a Mr. Ormstead, a handsome young man, who
                     was in the same occupation, as agent for his father at the port of Buffalo. The
                     latter was almost a daily visitor at Mrs. H——'s establishment, and was
                     courteous, attentive and very acceptable to Lydia; while the former, by his
                     polite and. manly courtesy, was favorably received by Miss Margaret.
                  In the course of a few weeks, Florence made overtures of love to Margaret,
                     which were favorably received, and much encouraged by Mrs. H—— and Miss
                     Bevington. Mr. Ormstead lent his influence, and everything seemed to go along
                     well. This being the first affection of Margaret, it was natural that it would
                     be a warm and sincere one. Such it was, for Florence was unremitting in his
                     repeated tokens of endearment. They loved each
                      other sincerely, and in a few weeks
                     understood each other as lovers only can. Florence told her that he had come on
                     at the mere mention of her beauty, for the purpose, if satisfied with her
                     charms and mental ability, to offer her marriage. Things had taken a proper
                     course, just as he would have them, and, as for herself, he had found, her more
                     than his "fancy painted her." He had written to his father, and was daily
                     expecting a reply; he moreover informed her that his parent was a kind and
                     generous one, and allowed him full scope of his desires, and had no doubt that
                     the next mail or so, would bring a favorable reply as to their union.
                  Margaret reposed the strictest confidence in the truth of Florence's statements
                     and well she might, for he was a man of probity and honor. But one day, while
                     on a pleasure tour to Niagara Falls, previous to the letters arriving from
                     Rhode Island, the couple were lolling upon a sofa, caressing and returning
                     words of sentiment and love. Margaret looked still more beautiful, with her
                     girlish womanhood—if we may be allowed the term—than ever, and was heart and
                     soul in love with Florence. He, as he expressed it, "was dying by the delay of
                     his father's—that his love was a burning passion, and would consume him, and
                     that if Margaret desired an alliance with him, it must be by secret marriage,
                     and at once." She protested and pointed out the propriety of awaiting his
                     fathers' consent—he replied by placing her soft hand upon his fevered brow.
                     Such a reply was irresistible. The clandestine marriage was arranged that
                     night, and Margaret was the wife of Florence. That night they returned to
                     Buffalo, and Florence, with an unsteady hand, entered upon the register of one
                     of the best hotels in the city, the names, Mr. and Mrs. Florence.
                  The husband wrote a letter almost immediately, announcing to his father all the
                     circumstances of the case, and telling him that he had waited beyond human
                     endurance, for his consent to their union. With anxiety the newly-married
                     couple awaited the reply from Florence's father to the second letter.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  The long-looked for letter came at last, and as Florence cast his eyes over the
                     epistle in their private room, Margaret watched with anguish the changes of
                     color, or rather the pallor which suffused the face of her husband; he sunk
                     into a seat at the opposite side of the table—she learned the contents of the
                     epistle before she perused it, from the face of her now distracted husband. The
                     letter ran thus:—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              EDMUND FLORENCE.—You are no longer my son—I discard you from the
                                 family position—I have torn the image of your person from my heart,
                                 and would not now recognize you, did you stand before me. I have
                                 taught your brothers and sisters not to think that you are their
                                 brother; it was a hard task for them at first, but their obedience
                                 to the parental rule, soon made them converts; and your name is now
                                 only remembered among them as a warning to disobedience—as a beacon
                                 light by which they shall travel I herewith send you a $1000 bill,
                                 which is all you can ever receive of me in life, or from me at
                                 death. I send on Pearsall to take charge of the books, offices
                                 &c., you will of course put him in possession of all that is
                                 essential for the carrying on of my business. You have married some
                                 vile, disreputable, cunning woman, who has inveigled you into
                                 marriage—be this as it may, you have robbed me of my title as a
                                 parent, by refusing to receive my consent. You have written, 't is
                                 true, but you would think me as a parent no better than you are a
                                 son, if you imagine I would give a hasty reply to so serious a
                                 matter—an assent of that kind should never escape me—I cannot
                                 forgive you—so you must not write.
                              
                                 Yours, &c.
                                 JOHN B. FLORENCE.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  While Margaret perused it line for line, Florence left the room. Before she had
                     scarcely folded the letter, a report of a pistol went thundering through the
                     spacious hotel. The thought flashed upon her, her husband had committed
                     suicide. In a moment the door of his chamber was burst open, and there in a
                     pool of blood, lay the dying husband. Margaret had just time to reach him when
                     he made a horrible grin, which was intended for a smile, and dropped DEAD.
                  As soon as the burial obsequies were over, Margaret returned to Mrs. H——'s
                     house, but kept herself more secluded and quiet than before; she did not appear
                     in the custom department at all, but confined herself exclusively to the
                     working branch, and superintended the young ladies.
                  Lydia and Margaret increased in friendship, and daily improved their
                     association by confiding some secret to each other. In a, few months the latter
                     discovered her proximity to maternity. The fact of her peculiar situation was
                     known to Lydia, who was desired to keep the matter a secret, for Margaret did
                     not wish to have it known, as her mind was fast undergoing a change, and she
                     did not care to have the responsibility of bringing up a child. Again she
                     nursed the false philosophy, that a child would make her widowhood unpleasant,
                     and blight her hopes of a re-marriage at any future day. Lydia listened to
                     these strange and unnatural conclusions without a wince, for she was an
                     unprincipled woman, as the reader will see anon. When Margaret had ceased
                     speaking, Lydia said.
                  "Then you wish to avoid this thing, do you?"
                  "I do."
                  "You wish to employ some powerful agent to effect the object you have in
                     view?"
                  "Precisely—can you help me in my dilemma?"
                  "Yes; there is a woman here practicing the business of fortune-teller,
                     astrology, etc., whom I can and will introduce to you, as she knows
                     everything."
                  "And now," said Lydia, "seeing that you hare unbosomed yourself to me without
                     reserve, I will tell you a portion of my history that will astonish you. When
                     first I came to this city—for I, like yourself, was born in the country, on a
                     farm near Ravenna in the state of Ohio. My parents were not so rich as yours,
                     and I came here to learn a trade, so that I might support myself—I soon became an object of
                     watchful attention to several young men in this place, and of all the
                     acquaintances I had among them, for I was a coquette, I preferred young
                     Ormstead, as he seemed to win my fancy. He was an accomplished and witty young
                     man; his joked I took for innocence, and his manners I thought resulted from
                     the morality that was infused into his nature by his fond parents from his
                     youth up; and so I loved him, and reposed every confidence in him, but he
                     abused the trust, and in an evil hour I fell into the snare that he had set to
                     rob me of all that holds a woman's life dear—her honor. This was about three
                     years ago, and about a year after I possessed an illegitimate——"
                  "But where is it now?" burst in Margaret.
                  "Listen to the end. You not only see in me a child of folly, but a
                     murderess."
                  "Great God!" said Margaret clasping her hands.
                  "I kept my own secret, as I slept alone on the bank of the canal; and as soon
                     as I was able to leave my room, I mercilessly murdered the little innocent,
                     placed it in a large basket, with some stones, (which I had concealed in my
                     room,) closed it up, took it to the bank of the canal, and threw it in. There
                     was one splash in the water—a shudder—a fear—and all was over! I soon returned
                     to my room, and pleaded sickness on the morrow, which continued to excuse me
                     for several days, and not a soul—save God—knows anything about it to this day,
                     no, not even my wronger, save you."
                  "Then, how, dear Lydia, is it," after listening with mingled horror and
                     surprise, to this tale of blood and secret crime in one she thought so lovely
                     and innocent," that you can ever tolerate this Ormstead, after so cruel and
                     base a seduction and desertion?"
                  "Why, because I love him. There is an infatuation and a passion that I feel for
                     him which is unaccountable and unworthy of me. I ought to insult him, and brand
                     him to the world as a villain; but I cannot. No, when I talk with him all my
                     asperities soften down, and though Ormstead should be my murderer, I should
                     kiss the hand that plunged the knife into this heart."
                  The friends then embraced, and slept, and dreamed in each other's arms.
                  Margaret carefully concealed the signs of her approaching maternity from every
                     eye, and in a few weeks, when her position became imminent, she removed to a
                     very secluded house near the wheelbarrow point of the Buffalo Creek, feigning
                     sickness; and as her means were plenty, there was no trouble about her being
                     excused.
                  About a week after the removal, on a very dark night, the heavens seeming to
                     darken to assist Margaret's base object, she emerged from the doors of the
                     house with a parcel in her hand, and rushed precipitately to the water's edge,
                     and there like her preceptor, threw in that poor little innocent—and became at
                     once an unnatural creature, for worse than a murderess is she who will deprive
                     of life her own offspring, and that child so young, so innocent. How selfish
                     must be her mind who would do such a deed for the gratification of any
                     particular fancy, as Margaret did.
                  The splash of the water aroused a man who was sleeping in a scow-boat, and
                     while Margaret was hurrying from the spot, she heard a man cry out in a loud
                     voice—"Stop, there."
                  Electrified, she stopped a moment and up came a brawny-looking fellow who,
                     catching hold of her wrist, said in a positive manner—
                  "You have been committing infanticide, I know you have. I have watched you here
                     for several days—I am a man not to be fooled. Now I want money—you have got it.
                     Give me a thousand dollars, and I will let you go. Come, what do you say? will
                     you hang, or give the money, eh?"
                  "Good God! I have not the money with me! You would not see me hanged, would
                     you?" asked Margaret.
                  He briefly replied, "I do n't care anything about you, either one way or the
                     other. It is not likely I should care about you, who would commit murder, is
                     it?"
                  "Hush! for heaven's sake, speak lower. I know not what to do, if we should be
                     discovered here—all would be revealed. I will get you the money by
                     morning."
                  "I shall let you go, but I shall drag for the infant, directly," said he. "I
                     have all prepared, and I shall hold that as a hostage against you. Now look ye,
                     Miss, there need be no nonsense twixt you and I. I know your name, it is"—and
                     he whispered it in Margaret's ear. She shuddered—"now I will meet you at Mrs.
                     H——'s, to-morrow evening."
                  "I shall not be able to return before three nights hence," observed
                     Margaret.
                  "Well, let it be, then, on the morning of the fourth day. Now, as you are sick,
                     why return to the house and seek rest and comfort Do n't forget, on Thursday
                     morning I shall be at Mrs. H——'s. Recollect, $1000—till then, farewell."
                  Margaret faintly replied, "farewell," and betook herself to the house. She went
                     to bed—no one having perceived her absence. Next morning she received a visit
                     from Lydia, who brought with her the astrologist and fortune-teller, Madame
                     Grous. Margaret at first refused the assistance of Madame, but upon her
                     friend's persuasion, she received her as a confidant. Lydia soon left her
                     friend again, and Margaret was in charge with Madame, who set about in an
                     ingenious manner to minister to Margaret's wants, physically, and even
                     mentally.
                  The patient found great relief in her hands, and was progressing well and
                     rapidly.
                  Margaret said at length, in the voice of a sick person—"I do n't know whether
                     you are aware of the fact, but I wish to conceal my position from the persons
                     in this house, as well as all else."
                  "Oh, do n't alarm yourself my dear, I 'm very, very discreet—very discreet; do
                     n't talk, that's a chick-a-biddy, said Madame Grous. I will talk to you, and
                     you must do the hearing."
                  Margaret smiled at this consideration, and the fortune-teller proceeded.
                  "You see this is my business, and of course I have to keep quiet. I hear all
                     and say nothing. Oh! I 'm very discreet. Any secret entrusted to me is safe, my
                     business is to keep secrets. I am consulted upon all matters, of various
                     natures, some very delicate questions indeed, in the course of a year, so I
                     must keep my tongue and my own council. Oh! I could hang and imprison a great
                     many here in Buffalo, if I liked." Margaret shuddered, but the nurse proceeded. Oh, Miss—or
                     shall I call you Madame? please say."
                  "Madame, if anything," replied the sick woman.
                  "Thank you. Oh! I 'm very discreet. Ah! as I was saying, I have been in a great
                     many bad scrapes, but then, I am the tool of others; they pay me and that is
                     all they want to do, and ail I want of them. I tell them the means, you see. I
                     am acquainted with all the poisons—their workings upon the system, but I use my
                     knowledge very carefully. Oh! I am very discreet, I assure you; but I do n't
                     tell anything about names. Oh! I 'm very discreet. People say, I wonder why
                     they do n't put this beldame down, that's me Madame, but they do n't know all.
                     I hold the secrets of thousands in my little finger, under this finger, and I
                     can snap it at them. Oh! Madame, I could show up their dark doings; I know it
                     all. I know everything about them. I know all about you. You were attacked last
                     might by a ruffian—you promised to give him a thousand dollars. Oh! I know it
                     all—but I am very discreet. Oh! very."
                  "How did you hear of this," said Margaret, in a wild tone.
                  "Oh! my chick-a-biddy, lay its pretty head down, there, go to its sleep. I have
                     talked too much. I know it; but how I know it, that's another question. But
                     your secret is safe with me. I want no pay to keep quiet. No pay. Its my
                     business to keep quiet. Oh! Madame, I am very discreet."
                  Margaret having partaken of some soothing medicines, soon fell to sleep, and
                     upon waking up called Madame Grous to her side.
                  "Madame," said the sick woman, "I want some poison, for—for—for—"
                  "Oh! you need not trouble yourself with any reasons, or giving me any account
                     of what it is for; that is your business and not mine. I'm very discreet—name
                     the effect you wish produced on the patient, and I will tell you what is the
                     surest."
                  "I wish it to take effect by degrees upon a stout frame, you understand,"
                     Margaret became bold and confiding.
                  "Oh, yes! I'm very discreet, Madame, put a very small quantity of 'Strychnia'
                     in some liquor or wine, and administer it in doses, that is safe and slow,"
                     said the Madame. My dear continued she, "will you have the isinglass or the
                     'blanc mange' now? I have got a little of the poison with me, here it is," said
                     she, fumbling over a reticule. "Oh, I 'm always ready. I 'm very discreet you
                     see."
                  "I am going to think a little," said Margaret, * * * she laid herself back upon
                     her pillow. "I will take no refreshment, now."
                  The patient soon recovered, and upon parting with Madame Grous, she gave her a
                     large sum in notes, who took them with the parting words. "Oh, I 'm very
                     discreet, my dear. I am very much obliged to you; nothing shall escape
                     me—secret as the grave. Discreet, very. Good day, Madame," and the astrologist
                     took her leave. Margaret started for home almost immediately.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  Seated in her private chamber, was Margaret C. Waldegrave. How different was
                     she from the moment we first found her. Although still a beautiful woman, there
                     was no trace of her modest and girlish character. Where had flown that serene
                     and religious face, and whence had come that wild and startling beauty? Her
                     calm and quiet looks had indeed gone, and a face betraying cunning, passion,
                     and misfortune, was only there. Margaret was running over her pleasures of
                     youth, and comparing them with her recent trouble. Oh, how great was her grief!
                     what a contrast was there!
                  The last letter she had received from home brought intelligence of the death of
                     her father, and with it, a sum of ten thousand dollars, all that he would give
                     her out of the estate. She had never seen him from the moment she had left her
                     home to join Mrs. H——. How bitter were her feelings now. Her cup was almost
                     filled to overflowing, and the gall was fast entering into her disposition. She
                     had not shed a tear, there was no such relief for her; the luxury of tears was
                     denied her. Ah! grief with dry eyes, is misery indeed.
                  A low tap is heard at the door. She faintly and shudderingly says, "come in,"
                     the door opens, and in walks a huge unshaven man; his face was tanned, and it
                     was only his broad frame which pronounced him not Indian, His eyes were black,
                     but buried beneath a heavy forehead, and garnished by huge eye-brows; his black
                     hair was shining and glossy, and made into two "pooties," on either side of the
                     cheek; he wore a green coat covered with a large number of buttons; his hat was
                     an old white one, with the flattest of brims, and put on awry; he had on a red
                     flannel shirt; his pants were turned up over a heavy pair of boots. He was a
                     brawny, tall man, very fierce in his looks, and with a voice almost choaked by
                     hoarseness which was perpetual.
                  "I am the man that——," he commenced.
                  "Be seated, sir, if you please—shut the door. I do n't require any repetition
                     of the sad scene. You want some money of me; will the thousand dollars I give
                     you now, satisfy you quite?"
                  "Perfectly; do n't want no more," he replied in a careless way.
                  "Enough! enough," said she, rising from her chair, "I will give it to you, but
                     I wish you to understand that this is all the money I can ever afford you, for
                     my father has just died, and he has left me but a moiety of what I expected,
                     and I have no further means of getting money in any amounts," and she proceeded
                     to her drawer.
                  He answered doggedly," I know all about it."
                  "There is the money," said she, "there are ten one hundred dollar bills, they
                     are all good.
                  "That's so," said he, merely drawing out a greasy wallet and placing
                      them therein, and then shoving them down into his pocket with great
                     force; he buttoned it up, and with "sang froid," he said, putting his hat on
                     the side of his greasy head, "you won't hear anything from me, Marm, in future,
                     I warrant. We are friends! give us the tip of your paw," and he held out his
                     callused hand, in which she timidly placed hers.
                  "I am glad to hear you say so."
                  "Good day," said he, relinquishing his grasp.
                  "Won't you have a drop of fine brandy, that I have received from a friend? It,
                     was a curious present to a lady, but it does for one's friends," remarked
                     Margaret.
                  "Oh! you women, I knows all about it, takes drops on the sly. Well, I 'll drink
                     with you, I aint a proud man."
                  She brought forth the bottle, and she was looking about for a glass, which she
                     knew was not to be found.
                  "Oh, do n't trouble yourself Marm," said Grous, and he lifted the bottle to his
                     mouth. "By gollys," said he, "that's what I call the sort; why, do you know
                     that beats mother Cockrane's brandy, and that's not to be winked at."
                  "Well," said Margaret, "you are welcome to the rest."
                  "Thankee," said Grous, and hammered in the cork with his clenched fist; stowed
                     away the bottle into one of his huge pockets, and disappeared.
                  Margaret reclined herself in the chair, and when she heard the street door
                     close, said, "Great God! where will this end? my hands are stained with another
                     murder; that man is poisoned," and fell back into her chair.
                  We will now follow Rufus Grous, for such was the desperate-looking man's name,
                     who had caught Margaret in the act of drowning her babe and who had just
                     received the ten bills as the price of his secrecy; and furthermore, who had
                     drank of the brandy, drugged with "Strychnia." The man returned to his bed, and
                     threw himself upon it; his wife, who was the fortune-teller, was engaged with a
                     lady upon some of the delicate and intricate affairs of her profession, and did
                     not return home until night Rufus felt himself getting momentarily worse; but
                     the infatuation of drinking, has such a hold that he never imagined he was
                     imbibing his death from that bottle. He drained the last drop of the poisoned
                     draught with the eagerness of a regular sot, and dropped back upon his bed,
                     with a deep groan, and a struggle, his eyes bursting from his head, and Rufus
                     Grous was a dead man.
                  The Madame just returned, looked about for her husband, and found him upon the
                     bed; she fumbled over his pockets, and soon possessed herself of his greasy
                     pocket-book, and its contents. She turned her face upwards, and her eyes rested
                     upon the repulsive looks of Rufus. She uttered a scream; the experienced woman
                     knew he was poisoned, and the thoughts of who was the perpetratress of the
                     deed, flashed upon her mind with the rapidity, of lightning, as she saw the
                     bottle lying by the side of his bed.
                  There was no time to be lost, Madame Grous never shed superfluous tears, but
                     putting her bonnet on carelessly, and throwing her shawl over her shoulders,
                     she called a carriage and drove to the police office—narrated, the
                     circumstances of the case, and immediately officers—cunning and ingenious
                     fellows—were sent in all directions. Madame Grous added rewards, to the
                     emergency of the case, and of course, gave an impulse to the search for the murderess. But, so far as
                     the city was concerned, not an iota could be heard of her; the search was vain
                     and hopeless.
                  We will now return to where we had left Margaret in her chamber, at Mrs. H——'s.
                     Immediately upon Grous's leaving, she commenced preparations for her escape—nay
                     her race for life. We may as well just remark, that Margaret's motives for
                     assassinating Grous, will be plain to every reader. She had no confidence in
                     his secrecy; she concluded that a man who would take a reward to keep silent
                     upon a deed of blood, would as cheaply and as readily expose it. Hence she felt
                     that her life would be in the hands of this base ruffian, at all times, and she
                     could not be secure at any time. Thus, then, by committing one crime, it will
                     be seen that we must continue our course, to conceal the first. Horrid as this
                     may appear, it is true; this accounts for the double and treble murders we so
                     often hear of. It is not the design of the assassin to put aside more than one
                     person, but there generally follows another which will be enabled to bring the
                     murderer to justice, as connecting the evidence; and therefore, to escape
                     punishment, another murder must be committed; and so on, till the murderer has
                     felled by his own hands, more persons than he desired to do.
                  Margaret disrobed herself, and, drawing out of the secret drawer of a splendid
                     writing desk, a small bottle filled with an inky liquid, she saturated her
                     face, neck, shoulders, arms, etc. with it, rubbing it in with the palms of her
                     hands, until her complexion was extremely dark, and which gave her the color of
                     an Indian; her dark hair, and dark eyes added to the illusion, We should say,
                     that this liquid was the essential juice of the walnut shell, diluted, and will
                     stain skin easily. She then drew from the drawer of a magnificent wardrobe,
                     some garments which were entirely of the Indian character; and when draped in
                     this costume, Margaret was a splendid specimen of a "Squaw," and taking some
                     moccasins, and reticules, and cakes which she had purchased at a variety store
                     on Main street, emerged from the house, and traced her way like one of the poor
                     aborigines, we see daily wandering in our streets, shrinking before the
                     superior intellect of the white man and longing for their own wigwam and
                     hunting ground. She, Margaret, did not offer her articles for sale, but
                     betaking herself to the dock, soon found a schooner that was going out for Port
                     Stanley, in Canada West. She presented the Captain with some of her wares, and
                     he took her on board, and they soon arrived on British ground. While on board,
                     the Captain paid special attention to Margaret, and even went so far as to put
                     his arm around her neck and kiss her; but this Margaret quickly resisted, and
                     withdrawing from her girdle a splendid poniard, waived it in the air, and
                     threatened if he did not desist in his improper civilities, she would plunge it
                     into his heart It is only just to Margaret's character, to say, that as yet,
                     she had betrayed no regular licentiousness, no base voluptuousness. She was
                     fast passing into the character of an assassin, but not a wanton.
                  Margaret next traveled towards Toronto, where she occupied a splendid suite of
                     apartments, and applied a powerful acid for the purpose of removing the stains
                     of the walnut coloring, supplied by a chemist; this, in the course of a week,
                     entirely removed the color which she had covered her face with, during which
                     time she confined herself to her room, and engaged no domestic. At the end of
                     that period Margaret assumed her former beautiful complexion; but alas! since
                     the poisoning of Crous, her face had undergone still more change, and now there
                     was not a trace of simplicity nor meekness left in her face, but a haughty,
                     proud, tragedy-queen like countenance.
                  She engaged a young and handsome girl as a domestic, and who grew much attached
                     to her, and the latter felt much respect and esteem for the girl, who was a
                     young French Canadian with a broken accent; every word of which rendered a
                     melody to the English language, and made Camilla still more fascinating than
                     her natural charms.
                  In the cool of evening, Margaret took a walk upon the principal street; she saw
                     her maid in company with a man whom she was certain she knew. Camilla
                     recognized her mistress, and blushed, while the man—a young and beautiful
                     one—cast his eyes in the direction of the woman who had called forth his
                     companion's blushes. A look of intelligence passed between Margaret and the
                     young man; they knew one another, but yet neither could fix upon each other's
                     identity. Till afterwards, while pursuing their separate course, turned over
                     and over the images of each other in their mind, and still could not give an
                     intelligent account of their previous acquaintance.
                  The next morning, said Margaret to Camilla, "I would like you to introduce to
                     me that young man whom I saw walking with you last evening."
                  The young girl blushed, and nodded assent, and withdrew. In the evening they
                     met. Margaret was dressed in the most consummate style of fashion. Jewels shone
                     all over her person; laces adorned her, and satin lent a lustre to her
                     magnificent beauty. The young man approached, and Margaret, in a dignified
                     manner, pointed to a seat in which he, with very easy grace, placed himself—and
                     opened the conversation thus:—
                  "Madame, or Miss," said he, inquiringly, with a smile displaying a fine set of
                     teeth.
                  "Madame," said Margaret, with a bland look. "I appreciate your compliment, sir,
                     but I am a widow."
                  "We met last evening, and I at once recognized your countenance as a familiar
                     one, and you seemed to know me, and yet, said he, with your permission, I will
                     introduce an Hibernianism, we know not each other. It is of no use to bewilder
                     ourselves further, here is my card."
                  Margaret rose to receive it, and as she read it, with a start, said—
                  "You are, then, Charles D. Ellas."
                  "At your service; now pray, may I take your card?" and the lady pointed to a
                     silver salver which stood upon the centre table. No sooner had he read it, than
                     Charles shouted with astonishment—
                  "And you are my old—my dear friend, my schoolmate, Margaret," and they were
                     both lost in amazement.
                  Soon followed mutual explanations, which placed Margaret in the power of
                     Charles, for, without explaining her career, the matter was now so opened by
                     police reports, as not to call for any secrecy in the premises. Charles's
                     career had been almost as eventful as that of Margaret's. He had gone to New
                     York to practice law, but deserted his professional studies, and became
                     connected with the most depraved and dissipated roues, from whose society he
                     escaped a gambler. He then went to the South, and from thence to the West, and
                     went with the steamboats, sailing on the Mississippi river, and occasionally on
                     the Ohio and Missouri rivers, where he followed the occupation
                     
                        J.W.ORR Se.N.Y.
                      of a regular gambler. He did not hesitate to commit any meanness
                     while at play. On board the "Red Stone," he one day was playing at poker, for
                     large stakes, which resulted in the fleecing of a young western merchant—who,
                     becoming irritated, called Charles "a swindler, and a coward." Charles always
                     daring and brave, retorted with the opprobrious name, "Liar." Upon which
                     followed, as soon as the boat came to a point, a landing between the
                     belligerents, an arrangement of seconds—duel, and the death of Mr. Horace De
                     Quincy, the young western merchant. Charles flew to the landing, there was a
                     boat for Pittsburg, in which he took passage in. From this depot of
                     manufacturers, he flew as fast as conveyance would carry him to the shores of
                     Canada, where we now find him. Here he joined a party of gamblers who had taken
                     quarters in a splendid house on King street, and were playing with the officers
                     of the British army, who were there in barracks.
                  The above is merely an outline of what had occurred to Charles, and but a mere
                     fraction of what he told Margaret, but the whole of which it is not essential
                     that we should repeat.
                  In the course of the next interview with Charles, Margaret called in
                     Camilla—her help, and told her to Charles' face her acquaintance with him would
                     end in shame. That he would merely win Camilla to satisfy his own lust, and
                     then cast her upon the world, a blighted thing. Charles hung down his head
                     while Camilla watched her mistress' countenance, and turned over in her mind
                     all the disappointments and procrastinations that Charles had invented for the
                     purpose of delaying their wedding day. The light dawned in upon Camilla, and
                     much as she had loved Charles, now as quickly and as warmly did she loathe him.
                     She thanked her mistress, and told her she believed that she was sincere, and
                     speaking her honest convictions. Margaret told her that she knew Charles from
                     youth, and that he had just recounted his history to her, and from what she
                     could learn, he was not fit to be the associate of an honest, virtuous girl.
                     Margaret told Camilla that she was herself, too impure and vicious a person,
                     for so innocent a girl to serve, and then presented her with a sum of money,
                     and bade her return to her friends in the neighborhood of Quebec, in Lower
                     Canada. Margaret now possessed little over seven thousand dollars, and with
                     this she knew not what to do. So she consulted with Charles, who told her that
                     she might profitably employ it by investing it with the firm of Fontainbleau
                     and Company, who were the proprietors of the gambling house he was connected
                     with. She did so, and soon learned to her dismay, that her entire property was
                     robbed from her by the proprietor. She was satisfied Charles knew nothing of
                     this, for he himself was reduced to the position of beggar. Charles now became
                     the paramour of his old school-fellow, who now found herself in the world
                     almost penniless, save what her jewels would bring; without friends, without
                     any employment, and without a character. In this dilemma they knew not what to
                     do, and had well nigh given up all hope, when Charles hit upon a plan—which was
                     to travel through the state of New York, to New York City, and deliver lectures
                     on Mesmerism and Animal Magnetism, as he had become familiar with those things,
                     by attending lectures and reading different books relating thereto. No sooner
                     did he inform Margaret of his plan, than she begged him to go at it at once. So
                     without delay they left Toronto, and went to Rochester, where Charles, under
                     the name of Belville, soon had large posters posted all over the city, which
                     attracted a large and respectable audience, night after night, to Corinthian
                     Hall. From Rochester they went to Syracuse Utica, Albany, etc., to New York
                     City, and met with good success in every place. Arriving at New York, they
                     stayed only a short time, and then hastened to Philadelphia, where he attracted
                     large audiences at the Chinese Museum for weeks.
                  While Charles was humbugging the staid Philadelphians, with his mesmerism,
                     etc., Margaret was not idle. She had managed by her finished address, as a lady
                     of ton, to ingratiate herself in good society, and drew around her a coterie of
                     the beau monde, who felt highly flattered to
                     bask in the smiles of the fascinating Mrs. Belville. Among her visitors, was a
                     Mr. Copeland, an owner of many collieries in northern Pennsylvania; a man, who,
                     if measured by his wealth, was certainly one of the most powerful in the city
                     of "brotherly love." He saw Margaret very repeatedly, and their acquaintance
                     became daily more interesting and secret in its character. Charles never showed
                     himself during his visits, and so Copeland enjoyed these tete-a-tetes secretly, till emboldened by the
                     friendliness of Margaret, he made improper overtures to her. Instead of
                     rebutting these things as she should have done, she merely sighed and cried a
                     little, but did not yield to his frequent importunings. She told him that she
                     was prepared to make any sacrifices for him, but that of honor. Copeland's
                     presents were profuse and costly, and although Margaret did not feel any
                     admiration for these baubles, no more than their marketable value, she
                     pretended to be flattered with these things, and every word to his ears
                     conveyed the idea that she was daily becoming more endeared to him. He asked
                     again; she then plead the vile subterfuge of "What would her position be if it
                     should be discovered." To this Copeland promised a competency for life. She at
                     length pretends to consent to his improper proposals, and the millionaire was
                     in ectasies when he found himself in the private apartments of the beautiful
                     Margaret
                  He was on the point of locking, the door, when a loud thundering knock came at
                     the panel. "Open the door, I say! open the door! thieves! thieves!" shouted
                     some one, but not sufficiently loud to alarm others. Margaret timidly opened
                     the door, previously having disposed of Mr. Copeland in a recess, before which
                     hung a curtain.
                  "Ha! base cyprian, have I caught you? Is this your treatment?" and Charles
                     swore and raved in a most natural manner, while Mrs. Margaret protested her
                     innocence in a way which would have established her position as a first rate
                     Desdemona. Never was a scene better acted—never a deeper laid plot so
                     successfully carried out.
                  Charles, after making sundry thrusts under the bed, and in the air, as if
                     digging for a Lothario, suddenly drew back the curtain, and there stood, hat in
                     hand, Mr. Copeland; he came forward, tried to speak, and so forth, but
                     stammered. Charles locked the door, and Margaret was fainting,
                     recovering—shrieking, and re-fainting in a most consummate manner upon a large
                     velvet stuffed rocking chair. Charles then proceeded to curse his wife, and her
                     Lothario, and asked what would become of him now? he was a ruined man, and he
                     threw in some beautiful figures about his Jewel
                      being stolen, and so forth.
                     Copeland whispered compensation—he replied, "what could repay him for a ruined
                     health," &c. &c. However, before the interview was over, Charles
                     received a check upon a bank for five thousand dollars. Copeland began to think
                     it was a hoax, but he knew an exposure would be disastrous to him, and his
                     position, he being a married man, and moving as a religious character before
                     society. Thus the pseudo Mr. and Mrs. Belville, were in possession of a large
                     amount of money. They laughed most immoderately at the grand fleecing to which
                     they had subjected Margaret's rich friend.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  Not long after the affair with the rich Mr. Copeland, one of Margaret's
                     numerous acquaintances begged permission to introduce one Monsieur Garamie, a
                     French gentleman, to which request Margaret graciously consented, and the next
                     evening Monsieur Garamie was introduced in due form. No sooner did he speak,
                     than Margaret recognized in him, the man Fontainbleau, who had robbed her of so
                     much money, at Toronto. She said nothing, However, but entertained him to the
                     best of her ability, and when at length, the hour for dispersing arrived, she
                     managed to whisper in his ear, to call on her the next morning at the hour of
                     ten. He supposing that he had captivated her, felt highly flattered, and
                     promised to be punctual at the hour. The next morning, at the hour of ten, he
                     called upon her, and began to thank her in a bland tone for the compliment she
                     had conferred upon him. She heard him to the end, and then in a cold tone,
                     asked him how he had thrived upon the money he had so basely stolen from her at
                     Toronto? He was struck with amazement at first, and could hardly believe it
                     possible that she was Margaret. But he soon recovered himself, and held out his
                     hand to her, which she refused at first to take. In another minute he pulled
                     out a large calf skin wallet, and opening it, took therefrom a large roll of
                     bills, and, handing them to her, said, "There is all the money I wronged you
                     out of, and I freely return it with many thanks to you for the use of it, as it
                     has been of great service to me; I have made more than ten thousand dollars by
                     it." He also took a splendid diamond ring off his finger, and presented it to
                     her, saying, "I hope you will now believe that I am not altogether forgetful of
                     past favors," Margaret took both the roll of bills, and the jeweled ring, the
                     latter of which, she put upon her finger, and then spreading out the money, she
                     counted it; when, finding it all right, she felt softened towards him, and,
                     holding out her hand, she said, "Come, let's make up, I own I judged you
                     harshly," Fontainbleau took her hand and raising it to his lips, respectfully
                     kissed it. They then talked over all that had befallen each other since they
                     last met, and before they separated, he had so far won her, that she consented
                     to leave Charles D. Ellas, and fly with him to New Orleans. So
                     they—Fontainbleau and Margaret—assumed the names of Monsieur and Madame Lehocq,
                     and hastened to leave Philadelphia for New Orleans, to carry out to the letter,
                     their gigantic gambling scheme. Arrived there, they took a large house, and
                     furnished it in the most gorgeous, and sumptuous manner. Soon their
                     anticipations were more than realized. Things went along exceedingly well;
                     money was rolled into the establishment, and Mrs. Lehocq was the centre of
                     attraction. We should mention, here, that Madame Lehocq was the presiding
                     goddess at the tables, but this of course, was only at the private tables; her
                     wit was brilliant, and this was refreshed by wine; her education useful, and
                     she knew well how to bring it prominently forward, whilst her refinement added
                     a lustre to her queen-like beauty. Lehocq, or Fontainbleau, which even name the
                     reader will recognize him by, was a tall, well-proportioned man, of about
                     thirty-five years; of a very dark complexion, but of very red cheeks, though
                     not vulgarly so; face rather long; he wore no whiskers, but a beard of a rather
                     lighter cast than his very dark and glossy hair; well-proportioned nose, rather
                     lengthy, and fine black eyes; his appearance was gentlemanly; his voice
                     agreeable, and his manners like all other Frenchmen, extremely polished and
                     fascinating. They prospered well, as we have before stated; that is, as far as
                     their pecuniary means was concerned.
                  Nothing worthy of note transpired for months, till one day in early spring they
                     were both surprised by the sudden appearance among them, of Charles D. Ellas.
                     Ellas had never known what had become of Margaret until then. By the merest
                     chance in the world he stumbled upon them, and was quite as much surprised to
                     see them both there as they were to see him. He pretended to care nothing about
                     what had transpired, but inwardly resolved to possess himself of Margaret, and
                     also revenge the wrong Lehocq had done him. He had not fully matured his plans
                     when, the next evening, as they were discussing a bottle of champagne, both
                     being quite inebriated, they commenced to quarrel like friends. Fontainbleau
                     arose and struck Ellas a heavy blow in the face, and Charles pulling adroitly
                     from under his sleeve a poniard, he made a desperate rush upon Fontainbleau and
                     stabbed him several times, till he, bleeding from the many gaping wounds, fell
                     to the floor, a corpse; and the drunken, infuriated murderer looked at the body
                     in surprise and vexation, in remorse and terror, at his own bloody deed. This
                     being all the work of a moment, Margaret stood lost—horror-stricken, and
                     dumbfounded. She knew not whether to fly or stay; to lift the corpse of him who
                     had been a husband to her, or fly upon him who had been in the same position
                     towards her. She knew it would not do to raise an alarm, because Charles held
                     the cord over her head as a terror. So they set about burying the body under
                     the hearthstone of the kitchen. When this was accomplished Margaret feeling
                     that suspicion would rest upon her as an accomplice in making way with her
                     husband, as Lehocq was generally understood to be, determined to give up the
                     establishment to Charles, and flee the city.
                  Margaret gathered up all the loose valuables, and ready cash, which, with her
                     jewels, amounted to a sum little short of twelve thousand dollars, (this was
                     the price of her crime,) and hastened to secure a passage on board a vessel
                     bound to Havana, which vessel weighed anchor shortly after she was on board,
                     and away she went at the rate of ten knots per hour, towards the "gem of the
                     Antilles,"—Cuba.
                  We may as well just give the particulars of Charles's career in the Crescent City. He soon deserted the order of
                     things as they had been pursued at Lehocq's well regulated establishment, and
                     turned it into a rendezvous for the greatest desperadoes, pickpockets and
                     counterfeiters; these organized themselves into a body and converted the
                     magnificent establishment, now owned by Charles, into their head-quarters, and
                     made him treasurer. They called themselves "The Alumni;" they numbered thirteen
                     at first, but soon swelled themselves into a band of one hundred and
                     fifty—regular correspondence was kept up. They were the most desperate and
                     formidable gang of ruffians ever associated—naught was too powerful nor too
                     mean for their execution.
                  They would rob from the person, break open a house, murder a family it
                     necessary, or kill a man, on the hiring of an enemy. They would pass broken
                     bank bills in the different sections where they were not known. Thus, a man in
                     New York city would purchase all the notes on broken banks he could find, and
                     these were dispatched to the different members of the Alumni, from the
                     principal office at New Orleans. Regular accounts were kept against each gang;
                     and each sub-division operated in a different quarter, under a leader. The
                     business of the New Orleans department was to keep the different branches
                     posted up in the excitements of the day, so that if any grand event was coming
                     off, a deputation from the Alumni might be reckoned on. There is scarcely any
                     desperate or extensive crime carried on, even to this time, that this band does
                     not have connection with; while several are weekly being imprisoned in various
                     parts of the Union. More converts are daily being made—the number is now over
                     four hundred. They have been hunted from their New Orleans quarters, but are
                     understood to branch out from the great Empire City, and even to the present
                     day they evade all search and detection as a body. Secretly are their
                     arrangements made, and its organization carried on. There is no branch of
                     chicanery and maneuver that these desperate men are not awake to; they are
                     composed of all nations—French, Swede, German, Russian, English, Scotch, and
                     American. They are principally from the large cities on this and the European
                     continent Their leader at the time we write, was Stew art McNulty—a deep,
                     calculating, cunning, avaricious, and talented Scotchman. But as our business
                     is not with the proceedings of the Alumni, in its midnight and noonday attacks
                     upon the peace and property of society, we shall leave them to their course,
                     and follow the subject of this narrative, the notorious Margaret C.
                     Waldegrave.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  Margaret in vain tried to sleep, though the night was tranquil as death; yet in
                     her soul was chaos that, admitted of no rest. She arose from her couch, the
                     most downy and voluptuous that the brilliant city of Havana could furnish, in
                     which place she had been residing one month, and throwing around her a loose
                     mantle, sallied forth. The gay city was at rest. A zephyr-like breeze bore away
                     the perspiration from her brow, and she felt herself much refreshed. The
                     moon—pale faced and bright, large and resplendent was standing tranquilly in
                     the heavens, surrounded by a most gorgeous, serene and transparent sky. And now
                     she looked at the fleecy clouds of ether which slowly seemed to pass along, how
                     beautiful—how bright—how light were they. These were a contrast to her saddened
                     and crushed heart of crime. Then turned she away and cast her eyes full in the
                     faces of Phœbus, the queen of the night; and that moon was to her like a
                     changing face, which reflected first her mother, now her father—anon Florence's
                     would be stamped upon its silvery surface, and he too would change into the
                     murderous face of Grous; then would her child appear with its little eyebrows
                     pursing at her, its mother! Oh! horror of horrors, this dissolving view, was a
                     picture of misery! she tried to turn away but that dread fascination which
                     often makes us look at sights that we would avoid, caused Margaret to look up
                     to this ever changing moon. Now her poor, murdered child relaxed, and Madame
                     Grous appeared with her wrinkled and sinful look. Next came Fontainbleau, with
                     his cuts and bruises; he too would vanish into the smiling face of Lydia
                     Bevington. She would desire him to stay for awhile that she might look upon the
                     face, but no such pleasure was granted to her. She could gaze no longer, her
                     eyeballs were scorching balls of fire. And then looked she upon the limpid
                     stream beneath her feet, gushing, it seemed to cool her vision—but this was not
                     for long, for while she was drinking in its magic beauties, it changed to a
                     lake of BLOOD, She tried to drag herself from the spot, but it was vain—a
                     thousand demon's strength seemed to hold her to it. Now turning her eyes
                     towards the trees waving as they were—and rejoicing in most eloquent and
                     natural music, she saw in the mingling of the leaves, a struggle between two
                     deadly foes; and all Nature's simplicity and beauty seemed to her more dreadful
                     than the painter's ideas of hell had ever realized on his canvass; till she
                     could endure it no more, and throwing herself forwards, fell with a heavy
                     weight, her full length upon the moistened grass. She had lain there some time
                     when she was aroused from her dreams by a small voice which sounded like a
                     flute—so sweet and genial was it to Margaret's ear.
                  "Arise, woman," said the pleasant voice, in perfect Spanish, "this is no place
                     for thee."
                  "Art thou mortal, that you are wandering here," said Margaret looking at this
                     strange apparition, as she thought it.
                  "I am mortal, but soon I hope to be immortal," said the melodious voice, "I
                     shall soon die and go to Heaven, I hope," and then, continued the musical
                     voice, "whither art thou wandering? you too should go to Heaven."
                  "Alas, I am too wicked," and the scalding tears fell thick and fast—uttered
                     Margaret, in a suffocating voice.
                  "Oh, no," said the young girl, for such was the voice's embodiment, "but you
                     are not prepared as I am—you are robust while I am, thank God! poor and wan, am
                     I not?" this was asked as though an affirmative answer was desired most.
                  "You are indeed very thin, and look as though you were fast going into another
                     world," replied Margaret sympathetically.
                  
                  "Thank you. I love you for that, for they all tell me I shall live. I shall
                     die," and she clasped her almost transparent hands with joy—simply said the
                     poor girl.
                  "Where do you live?" said Margaret.
                  "Here," said she, "all about these parts—this is all my home," said the fragile
                     gazelle, casting her large eyes all round her. "How do you like my home?"
                  "I like the grounds amazingly, but where is your house?"
                  "Ah! old; you think I must live in a stone house. Oh, but I do
                     not. I prefer a shaded tree on a summer night, and this arbour," pointing with
                     her attenuated finger, "in winter."
                  Margaret sighed, but questioned her, "Where is your food."
                  "Oh, I live upon fruit—do you love fruit? asked she of her new
                     acquaintance.
                  "I do, but not wholly," answered Margaret, "come said she, you have shown me
                     your home, will you see mine?"
                  "I will go, but do n't take me too far away, or my friends will miss me,"
                     answered the sickly girl.
                  "Have you any friends—pray who are they?" asked Margaret.
                  "Oh, yes, I have many friends—every tree is peopled with them, and they prosper
                     on every bush; my friends are the birds and the flowers. Who are your friends?"
                     asked the girl.
                  "Alas! I have no friends," said Margaret shedding tears.
                  "Do n't cry; but you must be very miserable without friends, are
                     you not," answered the flute-like voice, uttering a fearful though simple
                     truth.
                  "Will you be my friend," asked Margaret.
                  "Oh, yes. I'd like you for a friend, you are so lovely—but I cannot be with you
                     always, for I must see my other friends; the birds would be very angry if I did
                     not come to hear them sing."
                  They soon arrived at Margaret's splendid dwelling, when the latter asked the
                     poor consumptive lunatic girl her name. "They call me Jane, but my name is
                     Violet, for the flowers call me that, and I know it is my true name."
                  Margaret had her conveyed to a bedchamber beside her own—the poor girl was
                     placed upon a bed, and there, from sheer exhaustion, fell asleep, probably the
                     first time for weeks. Margaret slept soundly that night, and awoke refreshed,
                     going into the girl's room, she found her up and walking about like a caged
                     bird, still more death-like than before.
                  "Ha," said she, "I'm not pretty, nor can I sing; so set me free, and I will
                     pray for you up there," pointing upwards. "Indeed I am no bird. I am only the
                     friend of birds," urged the girl.
                  But Margaret soon introduced a doctor to her who know the child well, and said
                     that she was the daughter of an Artist who had died of brain fever. Still she
                     felt an interest in her, and wanted to adopt her as her natural offspring, but
                     the medical man told her she would not live for another day. Violet became very
                     calm and asked for a bird or two, and a flower to kiss and fondle, and when
                     supplied with these wants folded them to her heart, then kissed them, and cried
                     over them, and looking up, said, "The fountain of my eye is very refreshing to
                     flowers—they flourish under it"
                  In a few hours more, she took Margaret's hand, and told to prepare, for she and
                     her friends were all going to Heaven; her head fell back upon the pillow, her
                     face wore a gracious smile, and the painter's mad daughter was a corpse—though
                     she looked the same in life. Her flesh and form was parian marble to the gaze.
                     Margaret's disappointment was great at Violet's death, and felt that she had
                     killed the wild plant by nursing it as an exotic. This was not so, the feeble
                     frame of the mad girl was worn to the last. But Margaret was convinced in her
                     mind, that her presence had withered the flower—her hand had been the death
                     stroke to the girl, and for sometime she would pine and fret after her mad
                     girl. Violet's death was a sad disappointment to Margaret, and it added another
                     passion to her number—another grief to sour her life.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  Margaret had by this time resided three years in the city of Havana, before any
                     event of note occurred in her checkered career. She had led a reformed life.
                     Her fortune was competent to maintain her in plenty. She had a comfortable
                     residence, and nothing now marred her peace, save her night dreams, which were
                     often of the most horrible character, and conscience, which Shakspeare has
                     said, "makes cowards of us all," certainly beat down the spirit, impetuous,
                     turbulent, and irascible as it once was.
                  We will not attempt an analysis of her character at this time. "She was tired
                     of blood," and would fain have given up her worldly possessions and her
                     physical charms, for an honest, innocent mind. Others prided themselves that
                     they knew the world—she cursed the time that she became familiar with it. She
                     would have exchanged looks with the most wrinkled visage of hideous age, or the
                     penury of the street beggar, if she could have made herself a woman whose hands
                     were not stained with blood. Margaret's loneliness made her thoroughly
                     miserable, and she knew not what to do, where to find relief, or how to secure
                     it. The walls of her rooms were to her eyes a panorama of her vicious life,
                     from her cradle to this woful zenith of life. Her bed was a sea of tortures.
                     Every angle brought a victim or a criminal associate to her face. Her pillow
                     tossed her upon thorns, and her dreams were as horrible as hell itself. All
                     that a dreadful, sinful life could conjure up, was there. She would start and
                     stare, and the heavy perspiration would stand on her in drops of anguish, while
                     she thought—and think she must. Oh that she could have plucked out her brains,
                     and made herself a living carcass, a moving empty thing, with words, but no
                        thoughts. Crime indeed brings-its own rewards. Charity may
                     cover a multitude of sins; yes, minor ones, we grant, but not cruel, foul and
                     unnatural murder. Nothing can wipe this out. No—not if religion be true, and
                     there be a hell, and it is a place of scorpions, devils, and inexplicable
                     tortures; surely to such must blood-stained minds come at last.
                  Margaret now commenced to write her life; every day seemed to add to the bulk of this
                     book, and as it was written upon the paper, it seemed as though her heart grew
                     lighter and happier; it was a load taken off her incubus-burthened mind. But
                     still there was no real relief for her. Thoughts bowed down by grief, and a
                     soul living in dread of itself, is no light or pleasant companion. Margaret at
                     once found that all hopes of finding relief in a secluded life were a delusion
                     and a snare, and so she made one deep and dreadful plunge into the excitement
                     of fashionable life, excitement and entertainment, hoping thereby to dissipate
                     all the devils that haunted her. Her house was opened to the gayest of the gay
                     of the Cuban metropolis. Gambling was carried on to a powerful extent, but so
                     far as Margaret was concerned, without any business profit. Her "salons" were
                     opened to the most fashionable, and were more universally eulogized than any
                     others in this region of pleasure, dissipation, and amusement.
                  Among the persons who paid Margaret the most attention, was Signior Cordoval, a
                     wealthy Spaniard, who had just arrived from the mother country, and was
                     supposed to be connected with a secret diplomatic mission from the court of
                     Madrid. He played very recklessly, but generally won. His companion was a
                     Pierre Dupont, an accomplished French gentleman, with plenty of means, and the
                     heart to risk them. These men were two members of "the Alumni," and had
                     contrived by watching, to observe where Margaret had concealed her wealth, and
                     planned the means of robbing her. This was to be done when the saloons were
                     filled with company. But they found more assistance was necessary than
                     themselves; and their rough and hardy companions who were in the city were not
                     adapted to such a superior branch of the profession, and Lorenzo and Paul,
                     after due deliberation, determined to send on for the best member that the
                     Alumni could boast or spare. A letter was dispatched accordingly to
                     head-quarters for help. In the meanwhile Lorenzo continued unremitting in his
                     attentions, and Margaret seemed well pleased with his society. But as the
                     latter knew that rogues might appear in good clothing, she kept a sharp and
                     vigilant look over all her visitors; and her suspicions were aroused when she
                     caught Pierre trying to get a wax imitation of the key of her closet, which was
                     carelessly left on the table. But Margaret seemed not to notice it, and
                     continued to receive Lorenzo as one of her more favored guests. The Havana
                     branch of the Alumni received a letter from the head-quarters, that McNulty was
                     off east on some important affairs, but that Ellas would soon be along; and
                     shortly afterwards arrived in the city Mr. Charles D. Ellas, whose career
                     commenced and seemed almost inseparable from Margaret's, and who had progressed
                     or digressed so remarkably in their deeds, that their names will ever be
                     remembered as two of the worst criminals of society. Margaret, in the
                     meanwhile, removed all her money from where she had previously concealed it.
                     She received Charles very coldly, and great surprise was manifested in both
                     their actions and behavior when in the gay and brilliant drawing room their
                     eyes first met. The company perceived nothing strange in this. It was a
                     re-uniting of old friends. Cordoval and Dupont were both there, but their
                     hearts fell when they saw that their treasurer was recognized by the lady
                     herself. Margaret, with that quick perception which characterizes those who
                     have long been acquainted with
                      such robberies, mastered all the
                     secrets of the affair, understanding, at one thought, that Charles had been
                     sent for to engage her while the robbery was to be committed in another part of
                     the house. Our lady fell, or seemed to fall into the snare most directly, for
                     she even proposed herself, that she and Charles should go out to a country seat
                     she had taken and furnished for the summer, in the suburbs of Havana, about
                     half a mile from the metropolis, beside a beautiful stream. The place is called
                     the Chateau de Berrien, for Margaret still assumed the French character.
                  When they had arrived, Charles admired the beauty of the building and its
                     arrangements, as he thought once more of becoming Margaret's partner; but she
                     hated him for the murder of Fontainbleau. When he was reclining upon the sofa,
                     Margaret approached him, and embracing him with one arm, she drew secretly,
                     from beneath the ample sleeves of her magnificent dress, a poniard, and ran it
                     into the heart of Charles. He shrieked, tried to rise, but it was vain; the
                     blood came so fast that he could not assuage it, and he lay upon the sofa, in a
                     bath of his own blood, while Margaret, whose looks had become terrible with
                     rage, and whose beauty seemed to render her blood-bespattered countenance more
                     hideous and revolting, was standing over him. "Charles," shouted Margaret, "I
                     have had my revenge. I preserved you for my own revengeful spirit. Your friends
                     are not alone disappointed in their money adventure, but are now charred and
                     mangled corpses." He groaned. "That groan is a payment for your treachery.
                     You—whom I have befriended and helped—you were the one that treacherously
                     conspired with Dupont and Cordoval, to rob me of my last cent, and if
                     necessary, you would have murdered me; but the tables are now turned, and my
                     old schoolfellow,"—and she grinned with the ferocity of a tigress—"is now my
                     victim." Charles was trying to staunch the blood, but it spirted all over the
                     room, and Margaret laughed, fiend-like. "Your friends I have blown up by means
                     of gunpowder. You see, my dear Charles, that when I learned it was the
                     intention of your band to rob me, I removed the cash"—another laugh—"and
                     strewed the room with torpedoes and gunpowder, which of course exploded, the
                     moment they placed their feet upon them. Hark! what was that?" and a thundering
                     sound, like an earthquake, rent the air, a horrid light of an explosion
                     illuminated the chamber, and Charles was a corpse.
                  Margaret looked at him, and as she was viewing with mingled degrees of
                     satisfaction, awe, and horror, a thundering knock came at the door. It was
                     several police officers, who, passing by the Chateau de Berrien, were attracted
                     by groans. Margaret trembled; but so horror-stricken had she become, that when
                     the officers had battered in the door, and had her confined between them, she
                     had not recovered herself; and it was only on the morrow, that Margaret
                     remembered the events of her last murder. The horrors of Castle Moro, with its
                     heavy stone chambers, blank and dark cells, and heavy black window bars, soon
                     awoke her to a sense of her dreadful position.
                  It was not long after her arrest, before she was brought out for trial, and
                     much pity and commiseration were felt for her by all who saw her; and one Senor
                     Narciso, a member of the Havana bar, undertook her defence; and most ably did
                     he defend her to the last. But all his efforts were in vain. The terrible facts
                     were too glaring to admit of any doubt as to her guilt in the minds of the
                     judges, and she was convicted of the foul murder of Charles D. Ellas, Lorenzo
                     Cordoval, and Pierre Dupont, and sentenced to be publicly garoted, in Plaza
                     Square, July 9th, 1852.
                  After the sentence was pronounced, she was taken back to her cell in old Moro,
                     and bade prepare for eternity. Seeing that no hope remained but that she must
                     die an ignominious death, she became partially reconciled to her fate, and
                     consented to receive a reverend father of the Catholic church, as a spiritual
                     adviser.
                  Friday, July 9th, the day fixed upon for her execution, at length dawned upon
                     Havana. It was a clear, cloudless day, and at an early hour every body was
                     astir, for since the garoting of Lopez, nothing worthy of note had transpired
                     to create an excitement equal to this. By 9 A. M., every avenue to the
                     scaffolding, on which was to be enacted the bloody scene, was filled by an
                     eager multitude, whose animal propensities incited them to feast their greedy
                     eyes on the horrid spectacle. Fair senoritas, and brave cavaliers, lined the
                     streets, and occupied every eligible position at the windows, and upon the
                     house-tops. At length the dread procession began to move from the Castle Moro,
                     toward the plaza, preceded by a file of Castilian soldiers, having Margaret,
                     who was attended by a minister, in their midst. Oh! it was a grand, but sad
                     spectacle! and as it moved along in solemn silence, many a heart that beheld
                     it, quaked with fear. The soldiers, gaudily dressed in crimson and gold,
                     mounted on proud, neighing, prancing steeds, which pawed the ground in disdain,
                     while the sun reflected the burnished steel arms borne by the soldiery, gave
                     the street the appearance of a molten sea of silver.
                  
                  Arriving at the scaffolding, Margaret, in a sable colored dress, ascended the
                     platform in a languid manner, supported by the executioner. She then knelt
                     down, while her face was ashy pale, and received a benediction, after which,
                     she was raised up by the executioner, and placed in the fatal chair. Soon the
                     cold iron collar was placed around her neck, and she was fastened to the fatal
                     post, the deadly screw was turned, the cold steel penetrated the spine, and in
                     a moment she was a hideous corpse. Margaret, the once beautiful and
                     accomplished woman, was dead. She had outraged the laws, both human and divine.
                     Man had made her pay the penalty for breaking his laws, and sent her to stand
                     her trial before the Great Judge of divine law. Who shall say what the 
                        dicision
                        decision
                      of that Judge will be?
