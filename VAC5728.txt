            PREFACE.
            PRINCIPLES which are as familiar to us as "household words" were not understood two
               centuries ago. The progressive development of some of these was marked by great
               social convulsions, attended with much personal suffering. This was evinced in
               working out the great idea of religious liberty. In our enjoyment of this inestimable
               boon, we should not forget the sacrifices that it cost. We should frequently
               contemplate them, both to enliven our gratitude for the blessings we possess, and to
               learn lessons of wisdom from the errors or misfortunes of others.
            The past is filled with waymarks for the guidance of the present and the future.
                  And though these waymarks be in some
               instances stained with blood, or charred with fire, that fact only makes it the more
               important for us to learn the relations which they sustain to human freedom. It is
               not wise to ignore the errors of former ages. We should profit from their experience.
               The rocks on which others have struck should serve us as beacons. Only a few years
               have elapsed since, even in Massachusetts, the sword of state was wielded for the
               defence of religious opinions. The church was under the protection of the civil
               power. Practically, religious liberty was unknown. Those who presumed to differ in
               their ecclesiastical views and practices from the "powers that be," were exposed to
               various penalties. This, however, was the error of the age, and therefore not
               peculiar to the Puritans.
            In the present volume we have avoided all unjust aspersions upon the early planters
               of New England. We have indulged in no anathemas. We cheerfully acknowledge our
               reverence for their earnest, though austere piety, and our high appreciation of the
               results of their sufferings and their toils. Still they were not perfect. In some
               respects their principles were erroneous and their measures severe. No valid reason
               exists why this fact should be concealed. On the contrary, its contemplation, in the
               proper spirit, may be productive of good.
            This work is not one of mere fiction. Though a vein of imagination pervades it, it is
               only like a silken thread, on which are strung golden beads of truth. In our account
               of the important events connected with the treatment of Puritans by the Episcopal
               hierarchy of England, and of the Baptists by the Puritans of New England, we have
               conformed to the authentic records of that period. Our information was derived, in
               part, from the narratives of the sufferers themselves, and partly from the general
               histories of that age. Since that time the world has made progress. The descendants of those
               who then administered, in this commonwealth, the civil and ecclesiastical power, have
               outgrown the idea that the union of church and state is the best form of human
               government, or even essential to the best interests of religion. Whilst the
               descendants of those who then suffered even unto blood, for conscience sake, are far
               from cherishing any animosity towards the present generation for those errors of a
               by-gone age.

               CHAPTER I.
               THE PURSUIT.
               "WELL, we shall get off to-morrow, wife, if the Lord will."
               "Right glad be I to hear that, Abel. This being hunted and worried, like
                  partridges upon the mountains, and all for our love of truth, is dreadful."
               "True, true, wife; but let us try to be patient, for this is a part of the
                  inheritance bequeathed to us by our great Head, when he said that those who follow
                  him 'should receive, now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and
                  mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions.'"
               "Yes, Abel, and the other part of that verse furnishes solid comfort, which saith,
                  'And in the world to come eternal life.' I have read it a hundred times since the
                  unrighteous laws were passed against us, and have derived from it precious
                  consolation. O, how true it is, that 'if in this life only we have hope, we are of
                  all men most miserable!' But there is another life, when those who have suffered for Him here
                  will reign with Him there."
               O mother, mother," exclaimed a little girl, who suddenly entered the room, with
                  her face crimson with excitement, and panting for breath; "there is a great crowd
                  down the street, and they have got a man, and are taking him off to prison. His
                  wife and children are following him, crying dreadfully."
               "What has he done?"
               "I don't know; only I heard some people say it was good enough for him, for he
                  would not conform. I don't know what they meant."
               But her parents did. They belonged to a branch of the Christian Church who had
                  been stigmatized as Puritans, and who, because they refused to conform to the
                  church of England, and observe its useless, and what they deemed Popish and
                  sinful, ceremonies, had been fined, imprisoned, and, by the confiscation of their
                  property, reduced to poverty.
               "O, is it not terrible, Abel, that because that man will not do what he believes
                  is a sin against God, he must be torn from his family, and shut up in prison to
                  suffer, and, perhaps, to die?"
               Mr. Eaton, who had been thus addressed by his wife, did not immediately answer.
                  His head fell upon his breast, and his eyes were fixed vacantly upon the floor.
                  After being lost in thought for some time, during which the little girl left the
                  room, he pensively said, "True, true; and I have been thinking, wife, suppose I
                  should be taken, what would become of you and Priscilla?"
               "But do you think there is any danger?" asked Mrs. Eaton, in tones which indicated
                  no small degree of fear.
               "And why not? for this man whom Priscilla saw apprehended is, I dare say, one of
                  those who were to have embarked with us for America. The government has probably
                  heard of our plan to leave the country secretly; and they have sent magistrates
                  down to defeat us. They have discovered one of the party, and may possibly find
                  me; for you know I am not particularly prudent about concealing myself."
               "I know it; but I hope, in future, that, for my sake and Priscilla's, you will be
                  more cautious."
               "That's a motive that will have more influence with me than any other earthly
                  consideration. I care not for myself, but I feel for you."
               "And Priscilla, Abel! O, it seems to me,
                  at times, as if my heart was fixed too strongly upon that dear child. She is so
                  amiable, so affectionate, so obedient, I fear I have made her an idol. We have
                  never, as you know, had to correct her, and scarcely ever to speak sternly to her.
                  She cannot help us much yet; still she cheerfully does all she can. So benevolent
                  too! Why, if I should gratify her wishes, I should give away half of her clothes
                  to the poor children of the neighborhood. It was only yesterday that she came home
                  without any thing on her head; and when I asked her where her bonnet was, she said
                  she gave it to a poor little girl whom she saw in the street without any, and who
                  was crying with the headache; and she said she came straight home to ask me if I
                  had any objections; for if she had done wrong, she would go back, and bring the
                  little girl here, and then she knew I would give it to her willingly."
               Priscilla now reëntered the room, more flushed and excited than she was before. "O
                  father, the street is full of people. The crowd have divided—some are going with
                  the man to prison, and some are coming this way. O, I am so frightened!"
               "Frightened at what?"
               "Why, I thought perhaps they are coming for father. I saw a man point at me, and
                  say, 'That's his girl;' and when I turned away, they followed me."
               A woman now rushed into the house, exclaiming, in great agitation, "Flee, flee,
                  Mr. Eaton; the magistrates are after you. They just stopped me, and asked where
                  you lived. I told them they would probably find you at the shop; and they have
                  gone there."
               "And why did you tell that which was false?" said the stern Puritan.
               "I did not know that you were not there; and I thought that whilst they were
                  examining the shop I could give you the alarm."
               "It is no time to argue," said Mrs. Eaton. "The shop is but a step off, and they
                  will be here in a moment. Abel, you must conceal yourself instantly," said his
                  terrified wife.
               "That is easier said than done," rejoined Mr. Eaton, calmly. "Where shall I
                  go?"
               A half dozen impracticable things were proposed in less time than half the same
                  number of minutes. The house which they occupied was small, and contained only
                  four rooms, all of which were empty, except the one in which they now were, which
                  contained a small table, a bed, and two or three chairs, with a barrel in one
                  corner partly packed with things. As they
                  had expected to sail on the morrow, all the rest of their furniture was on board
                  the vessel; and in the evening they intended to remove the remainder, under the
                  friendly protection of the darkness.
               There was every chance for detection, but slight hope of concealment. The garret,
                  the cellar, the closets, and the bed were all suggested; but a moment's reflection
                  was sufficient to show their insecurity. "The chimney!" said the woman who had
                  given the alarm.
               "That will not do," said Mr. Eaton. "The smoke would produce a cough, and that
                  would expose me; their heads would be in the fireplace the first thing."
               The voices of the crowd were now heard in the street. They were evidently near the
                  house.
               "O God, send deliverance," ejaculated Mrs. Eaton, and then immediately added, "I
                  have it; I have it." As quick as a flash, the contents of the barrel were emptied
                  confusedly upon the table. "Now, Abel, kneel or sit down on the floor, and let me
                  cover you with the barrel. It's the only thing that can be done," said Mrs. Eaton,
                  with great rapidity.
               "I despise it," said the bold, indignant Puritan tan—"this cowardly skulking out
                  of sight like a frightened rat."
               "But for my sake, Abel,—for my sake and Priscilla's,—O, stoop——"
               This was an appeal which he could not resist. Sitting down, he allowed himself to
                  be covered with the barrel. Within a few moments, the ingenious plan of the good
                  woman was completed. The barrel was covered with a neat white table cloth, which
                  had been emptied, with other things, upon the table. Three cups and saucers were
                  placed upon it, with milk and sugar cups, a loaf of bread, and the teapot. She
                  then set three chairs around, telling Priscilla and the woman to take a seat, as
                  if they were at their tea. "When they come, let me do all the talking," said Mrs.
                  Eaton.
               She had scarcely completed her arrangements before the crowd were at the door.
                  Presently a loud rapping was heard. Mrs. Eaton went to the door, which the woman
                  had locked when she entered to give warning. She feared more on account of the
                  crowd than the officers. If a multitude of rude men should enter who sympathized
                  with the magistrates, she knew that it would be much more likely that the barrel
                  would be moved than though the officers entered alone. It was her policy, therefore, to have the officers only
                  admitted. "What's wanting?" said she, with forced calmness.
               "We wish to enter," replied a voice outside.
               "But I do not wish such a crowd in my house."
               "No one shall pass the threshold, my good woman, but two gentlemen."
               "In that case," said Mrs. Eaton, "you can come in."
               The door was opened, and the magistrates, after forbidding the crowd to follow,
                  entered.
               "Well, my nice little girl," said one of the officers, to Priscilla, in a very
                  affectionate tone of voice, "where is your father?" He thought to throw the child
                  off her guard, and obtain a correct answer. He knew that the Puritans inculcated
                  veracity as an important duty, and severely punished falsehood. As Priscilla
                  remained silent, he asked again, but shaping the question so that she must
                  disclose her knowledge of her father's concealment, or else tell a falsehood. "Do
                  you not know, my dear, where your father is?"
               "Mother," said Priscilla, "where is father?"
               "O, if you can't tell, we will question your mother," replied the
                  interrogator.
               "We have come, woman, with a warrant to apprehend Mr. Eaton."
               "You had better, then, go where he is," interrupted Mrs. Eaton.
               "We believe he is in this house, and our duty is to search it."
               "Proceed, then, to your duty. Mrs. Brown, help yourself to more tea."
               The house was now thoroughly examined by the officers. All the rooms, closets, and
                  chimneys were searched. They looked under the bed, and into it, and threw the
                  things from the table, to see if he was covered by them. Mrs. Brown and Priscilla,
                  in the mean time, were busily taking their tea—in appearance; for not a leaf of
                  tea nor a drop of water had been put in the pot.
               The ruse succeeded admirably. The officers of the law were put upon a false scent,
                  and left the house without making any discovery.
               After the crowd had dispersed, Mrs. Eaton broke forth into ejaculatory
                  thanksgiving, the tears streaming from her eyes. "Bless the Lord, O my soul, who
                  hath rescued my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions."
               When the barrel was removed, and Mr. Eaton could breathe freely, the first words
                     that fell from his lips were, "Let us
                  return thanks to God for this gracious deliverance."
               Kneeling down, he offered a fervent prayer, mingled with devout thanksgiving, that
                  he had been so signally rescued from the hands of the destroyer.
               "Ah, how true it is," said his wife, at the conclusion of this religious service,
                  "that the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
                  delivereth them!"
               "Verily; but our redemption is not yet complete. I shall not feel entirely safe
                  until I find myself tossed upon the billows of the friendly deep." "Every thing
                  was now put in a condition to be removed at a moment's warning. In the evening,
                  they were secretly taken on board the Griffin, which, for greater safety, had
                  hauled out in the offing.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               A CHILD MISSED.
               AFTER seeing the goods safely on board the small boat, Mr. Eaton returned for his
                  family. He found his wife at home alone, as Priscilla, with her permission, had
                  gone to bid her cousins farewell, who resided in a neighboring street. "I told
                  her," said the wife, "that when she returned, if she did not find me, here, to
                  come immediately to the wharf."
               "She will no doubt do so, as she knows the way well; and as the captain wants to
                  get`off as soon as possible, we had better go down to the boat; besides, those
                  officers may be after us again. If Priscilla is not there in a few minutes, I will
                  return for her."
               The two Puritans now passed cautiously along the streets to the water. When they
                  reached there, the company generally had arrived. There were husbands and wives,
                  parents and children, about to enter upon a long and dangerous voyage across the
                  Atlantic, to settle in a new world, in
                  the midst of barbarous tribes, because a tyrannical government at home would not
                  allow them the enjoyment of their own religious sentiments.
               After waiting a few minutes, Mr. Eaton went back after Priscilla. But not finding
                  her at the house, he went hastily to the cousins of whom Priscilla had gone to
                  take her leave. They told him she had left but a few moments before. He went back
                  to the house, and, not finding her, he hastened to the wharf. Two boats were
                  there, one of which was full of emigrants, and had pushed off from the wharf. The
                  other was still fast to the dock, and was being filled with passengers. It being
                  dark, he could not see; he therefore raised his voice, and hallooed, Is Priscilla
                  here?"
               "Yes, here she is, all safe," replied a voice on board the barge, which was
                  filled, and was disappearing in the darkness. "Don't be alarmed; I will take good
                  care of her."
               His fears concerning his daughter being allayed, Mr. Eaton turned his attention to
                  his wife. He attempted to hand her down the narrow stairway to the boat, but found
                  it impossible, in consequence of the numbers who were there. He stepped back, to
                  allow the others to enter the boat first. Whilst standing as if he were a mere
                  spectator, a gentleman approached him, and, in a low voice, asked him if Mr. Abel
                  Eaton was there. His voice had been heard too recently not to be at once
                  recognized by Mr. Eaton. It was one of the magistrates who had searched his house,
                  with a warrant for his apprehension.
               "He was here a few minutes ago," replied Eaton, in a low, confidential tone, as if
                  to intimate to the stranger that he sympathized with him.
               "Do you know that he is not here now?" continued the stranger.
               "No, I do not know that, for it is hard telling where these wandering Puritans are
                  at any time. They are as rapid and slimy as eels; in one place to-day, and in
                  another to-morrow; packed like herrings in a barrel at one time, and at another
                  bearding the lion in his den."
               "You are right, friend. I went, this afternoon, to Eaton's house, where a man told
                  me he saw him enter but a moment before, and, though I searched the house, high
                  and low, he could not be found. Do you think he is on board this boat, which, by
                  the light of the lamp, I see is nearly full of passengers?"
               
               "I could easily tell if I was only a little nearer."
               "If you will ascertain that he is there, neighbor, before the boat pushes off, I
                  will give thee twenty pounds. It is a matter of great consequence to me."
               "I will step down the passage way, and see, and perhaps inquire. They will suspect
                  nothing from me, as I am well known."
               "Do, do," said the stranger, impatiently; "and go into the boat, if you please, to
                     make it sure."
               "Ay, ay," was the reply.
               "Woman, shall I hand you to the boat?" said Mr. Eaton to his wife, as though she
                  were a stranger. She took his arm, and they descended the narrow stairway
                  together. To make it sure, but in a very different sense from what
                  the stranger intended, Mr. Eaton entered the boat. All of the passengers being on
                  board, it pushed off from the wharf, and soon nothing was seen but a lamp dancing
                  upon the water.
               "I am bitten now," said the officer to himself. "That fellow was no doubt a cursed
                  Puritan—perhaps Eaton himself. If I knew where the vessel was, I would board her
                  tonight." After pausing and thinking a moment, he suddenly said, "I can follow
                  their light, and reach her in that manner." He looked up to see the light rising
                  and falling with the waves, but it had disappeared. There was nothing there but
                  dense darkness.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               THE DARK PASSAGE.
               WHEN the party left the wharf, it was with suppressed sighs, silent tears, and
                  aching hearts. They were crowded together—men, women, and children—so closely that
                  some were obliged to sit in the laps of the others, and a few to dispose
                  themselves between the seats, upon the bottom of the boat, in such positions as
                  they were able to, which, at the best, were far from being comfortable. All were
                  silent. Each one was too much engrossed in his own thoughts and feelings to
                  indulge in conversation. Nought was heard, save the noise of the oars, as they
                  dipped into the water, or slipped between the pins, and the breaking of the waves
                  upon the boat, as she cut her way gallantly through them. After proceeding a short
                  distance in this manner, the silence was broken by Mr. Eaton saying,—
               "'Bless the Lord for his goodness;' for we have had a narrow escape from 'the paw
                  of the lion, and from the paw of the bear.' Like hounds who can follow, through
                  all their windings, the course of the hunted deer, until they take to the water,
                  and make their escape, so those government officers have scented and followed us
                  down to our very embarkation."
               "Do you think they are aware of our departure?" asked his wife, whom he was
                  endeavoring to screen from the damp wind of the night.
               "Indeed they do, wife. One of them was on the dock at our departure, who very
                  anxiously asked me if Mr. Abel Eaton was on board; and at his request I entered
                  the boat, to make sure whether he was there or not; and I have not
                  returned to make my report," continued he, with a slight laugh.
               "That increases our danger," said another. "He will suspect that you are here, and
                  will come out to the ship with his warrant to seize you, and, very likely, some of
                  the others."
               "O, how the sea wets me!" said a timid female in the bow of the boat.
               "So it does me," replied another, who sat on the windward side of the boat. "I am
                  almost drenched through."
               An attempt was made to change their places; but as soon as they rose, one of the
                  boatmen cried out, in a rough, coarse tone of authority, "Down in the bow! don't
                  you see the water's to our gunwale now?
                  The slightest motion may send us all to old Davy's locker; and then the magistrate
                  and the devil too would be puzzled to find you." The wet passengers instantly
                  resumed their seats.
               "That is a most comforting passage," said an old man to the females, after they
                  had taken their uncomfortable places, with the salt spray blowing upon them,
                  "which saith, in Isaiah, 'Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; when thou passest
                  through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not
                  overflow thee.'"
               "In truth it is; and I have been thinking that the very darkness is an evidence of
                  his presence, for we read that 'clouds and darkness are round about him,' and that
                  'darkness is his pavilion.'"
               With these and various other passages of Scripture did they endeavor to strengthen
                  their confidence in the protecting care of their heavenly Father.
               Whilst this conversation was going on in the bow of the boat, another was in
                  progress in the stern, where the Eatons were.
               "If the magistrates should attempt to board us to-night, they would find it a
                  difficult job in the dark."
               "Not while that telltale lamp is burning," interrupted the same rough voice which
                  had just before addressed the wet females.
               "True enough," said Mr. Eaton, "they could follow it straight to the vessel; put
                  it out."
               It was at once extinguished. It was just after this that the magistrate on the
                  dock raised his eyes to see the direction of the boat, and was met by nothing but
                  darkness.
               After hard rowing of more than an hour, with the wind rising and the waves
                  increasing, so that every few minutes they broke over the boat, drenching the
                  passengers, they finally reached the Griffin. All was now confusion. Those on
                  board assembled to the side of the vessel to welcome the new comers, whilst those
                  in the boat rose to their feet to prepare for the ascent to the ship. Lights were
                  brought. The men kept the boat as steady as possible, by clinging to the ship, and
                  the passengers were passed up, with many cautions to hold on tight, and with help
                  from below and above, until they were all safely on deck.
               "Is Priscilla on board?" asked Mr. Eaton.
               "She is," replied the same person who had answered him when he asked the same
                  question from the wharf. "And she was so fatigued that she fell asleep in my arms
                  before we arrived. I have laid her in my
                  berth, where she may remain quietly till morning."
               This intelligence being satisfactory to the parents, their anxiety concerning her
                  was removed.
               As all the passengers and merchandise were now safely on board, and nothing
                  hindered the departure of the vessel but the darkness, Mr. Eaton, with a number of
                  the other Puritans, informed the captain that the officers of government were
                  aware, of their embarkation, and might, possibly, come on board during the night
                  if they continued at anchor; and as they did not wish, after all the harassing
                  trials they had experienced, to be apprehended and thrown into prison for
                  conscience' sake, they earnestly requested him to weigh anchor and proceed on the
                  voyage immediately.
               "That I will, friends, right gladly. The wind is fair; the lights in the harbor
                  and on the islands can be distinctly seen, so that I can find my way to sea as
                  easily as if there were guideboards the whole distance."
               "With twelve hours' start they will not easily overtake us."
               "They will not attempt it. If they should, I will give them one run. I don't
                  pretend to have any great cargo of religion on board my own craft," said the
                  captain, striking his breast; "but this privateering after religious people, as if
                  they were so many pirates, because they happen to sail under another flag, isn't
                  the thing. My old mother used to tell me that 'Jack ought to do as he would be
                  done by,' and if a sailor, who don't see the inside of a church from one year's
                  end to another, ought to act on that principle, I don't see why those who profess
                  to be so very godly should be released from it. If religion teaches one sect of
                  Christians to hunt, imprison, and execute another sect, the less we have of it the
                  better."
               "I'm glad to hear you say that, captain; but we've no time to lose!"
               "True, true, the government barge may be in your wake already. Mr. Snell,"
                  continued the captain, addressing his chief mate, "get the ship under weigh
                  immediately, and give her as much sail as she will bear."
               "Ay, ay, sir"
               In a few minutes a bustling was heard upon deck among the crew; the sails, were
                  unfurled; the anchor weighed, and, ere long, the Griffin was rapidly ploughing her
                  way through the deep, dark water, with a fair, stiff breeze, for the open sea.
                  There being no moon, and the sky being overcast with thick clouds, the darkness ness was total. Nought could be seen save
                  the lighthouse, shining in the distance like a single lamp, and the illuminated
                  wake of the Griffin, as if she were sailing through a sea of embers, and leaving
                  behind her a path of fire. With the permission of the captain, religious services
                  were held in the cabin.
               Mr. Eaton, taking from his pocket a small Bible, turned to the forty-sixth Psalm,
                  and said he would read Luther's favorite psalm in time of trial. After announcing
                  its title, "The church's confidence in God," he read, in slow and measured tones,
                  "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will
                  not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into
                  the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
                  mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. There is a river, the streams
                  whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the
                  Most High."
               After finishing the psalm, he offered some remarks, to show its appropriateness to
                  their present condition; and then one of the others engaged in a long and earnest
                  prayer, the prominent characteristics of which were its abundance of scriptural
                  quotations, and the spiritual application of Old Testament history and of
                  Solomon's Songs.
               During the night, the wind increased to almost a gale. But as it was in the right
                  quarter, it drove the vessel onward with greater rapidity.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE DISCOVERY.
               THE sun had long been above the horizon before any of the passengers came upon
                  deck. Fatigue, the motion of the vessel, and sea-sickness, with all its
                  accompanying inconveniences, served to keep them below.
               All of these combined were sufficient to keep Mrs. Eaton confined to her berth.
                  Yet, when she awoke, her first thoughts were upon Priscilla. She had not seen her
                  since she left to bid her cousin farewell on the preceding afternoon. She
                  condemned herself for not having looked upon her in the evening, as she was
                  sleeping in another berth, and seeing, with her own eyes, that she was comfortably
                  provided for. The confusion on board at that time, her own fatigue, and the
                  confidence she placed in her daughter's protector, did not now seem a sufficient
                  justification for the omission. "I must see her now," whispered she to herself.
                  "Abel," said she, to her husband, who was bracing himself between a chair and a
                  large sea trunk, to keep himself from pitching off—"Abel, bring me Priscilla."
                  "Impossible, wife. We are now out to sea; she is sleeping in another part of the
                  vessel; to attempt to bring her across the deck, when the ship is pitching so
                  violently, would be to risk her life. Be patient till the wind subsides, and then
                  I will get her."
               "O dear! shall I ever see my daughter, my darling, again?" And she burst into
                  tears. "Abel, do bring her here. I had a strange dream last night, and though it
                  was not much, I cannot banish it from my mind. I know not why it is, yet it
                  worries me, and you know God sometimes speaks to his children in dreams and in
                  visions of the night."
               "What was your dream?"
               "I dreamt that you gave me a lamb, the most perfect and beautiful creature I ever
                  saw; so playful, so gentle, it would run and leap around me like a little child,
                  and eat out of my hands without the least fear. O, how I loved it! how carefully I
                  watched over it, that no harm might befall it! 'it lay in my bosom, and was unto
                  me as a daughter.' Well, I thought it was playing in the fields, in the afternoon,
                  with other little lambs, when a thunder storm suddenly gathered, and the rain
                  poured down in torrents. I ran out,
                  seized it, and brought it home. It behaved strangely, as if it had never seen me.
                  In the morning a neighbor came in, and said the lamb was not mine; it belonged to
                  him, and he would have it. As he tore it from me, I awoke, and found myself
                  crying. Perhaps it's weakness in me, but I can't help my tears;" and she brushed
                  her eyelids with the ends of her fingers.
               "Be not superstitious, wife. We have never dealt in sheep; what meaning, then, can
                  there be in your dream?"
               "Do we not possess a lamb? O, let me see Priscilla, and I shall be satisfied."
               "Calm yourself, and be patient. The exciting scenes through which you have
                  recently passed have made you nervous."
               "I'm a mother!" she exclaimed, in impassioned tones, raising herself from her
                  pillow, with an unnatural wildness in her appearance. "No one can feel as a mother
                  does. O, bring me my child!"
               "I will, wife, so soon as I can go into the other cabin with safety. Lie down, and
                  keep quiet, and you shall have your lamb before long."
               Mrs. Eaton resumed her pillow, and in a few minutes was in a doze. Although her
                  husband was not superstitious, and could account for her unpleasant dream on
                  perfectly natura principles, it cannot be denied that a painful impression was
                  made upon his own mind. He therefore asked one of the ship's officers, who was
                  upon his "sea legs," and could walk the deck with but little difficulty, to
                  inquire in the other cabin (which was a part of the hold of the vessel,
                  temporarily fitted up for passengers, and which contained the largest part of the
                  company) how Priscilla was getting along. He did so, and returned a favorable
                  report. She had slept well during the night, but was a little seasick then.
               Her mother continued in a disturbed sleep, occasionally speaking in her dreams,
                  for some two or three hours.
               "Where is my bird?" said she, as she opened her eyes, and stared wildly around the
                  cabin. "I thought I had a dear little bird, that would sit on my shoulder, eat
                  from my mouth, and sing most sweetly. I was about putting it in its cage, and now
                  it's gone."
               "It was only a dream, wife."
               "I know it, Abel; but if I could see Priscilla, I shouldn't have such dreams."
               "I have just learned, by inquiry of one of the ship's officers, that she slept
                  well last night, but is a little sick,
                  from the motion of the vessel, this morning."
               "Why have you not seen her?" replied she, in tones of reproof. "If I were a man, I
                  would go to her, though the vessel pitched as badly as did Noah's ark upon the
                  waters of the deluge. Abel, I cannot endure her absence any longer. See her I
                  will, if I have to cross the unsteady deck myself."
               This was said with great emphasis, accompanied with an effort to leave her berth.
                  Mr. Eaton, seeing no other way of pacifying his wife, promised to send for his
                  daughter immediately. He groped his way to the cabin door, by supporting himself
                  upon the different permanent objects which were within his reach, and asked Mr.
                  Snell, the first mate, to fetch Priscilla into his cabin. He then returned to his
                  seat.
               In a few moments the kind-hearted sailor returned, saying, in playful tones, "Here
                  comes Priscilla."
               Mrs. Eaton raised herself in her berth, and reached forth her hands, to receive
                  from her husband her idolized daughter. But the moment the child was brought into
                  the cabin, Mrs. Eaton exclaimed, in tones expressive of the deepest disappointment
                  and anguish,— "That is not my daughter! that is not Priscilla!"
               "Yes, I am Priscilla; and there is no other here," answered the little
                  light-complexioned, auburn-haired girl.
               The whole truth now flashed upon the minds of the parents in an instant. The
                  mother uttered a loud, heart-piercing shriek, and fell back senseless upon her
                  pillow. The father raised his hands to heaven, and passionately exclaimed, "My
                  daughter! where's my daughter? O God, save my daughter!"
               All was now confusion and consternation on board the vessel.
               In a few moments the whole story was known to all the passengers—that Priscilla
                  Eaton was left behind; that when Mr. Eaton inquired at the wharf, and upon his
                  arrival at the ship, whether Priscilla was safe, and received answers in the
                  affirmative, neither he nor the person who replied had the remotest idea that
                  there were two of the same name in the party. The question had reference to one
                  Priscilla, and the answer referred to another. This led to the fatal mistake. If
                  Mr. Eaton had added the surname of his daughter, when he inquired for her, all
                  misunderstanding would have been prevented. But this he did not do.
               
               All thoughts were now directed to the missing child. Mr. Eaton, with the other
                  passengers, entreated the captain to return, that he might obtain his daughter.
                  This he was unwilling to do.
               "The wind is dead ahead to return, but fair to proceed. To go back, we should lose
                  at least three days; this would be doing great injustice to my owners. Besides,
                  the government officers have probably heard that the girl has been unfortunately
                  left behind, and they will use her as bait to catch those who should return for
                  her. They will have writs for every one of you, and will serve them upon whoever
                  goes ashore, and perhaps come on board the ship, and carry you all to prison. It
                  would be madness to return. The girl will no doubt be provided for, and can easily
                  be sent over in some other vessel. I'm sorry for the accident, but cannot go
                  back."
               All arguments, persuasions, and offers of pay were unavailing. The captain adhered
                  to his resolution not to return.
               "Don't tease me," said he, with some degree of petulance, as Mr. Eaton was
                  pressing his appeals. "I'm not like that flag overhead, changing with every wind
                  that blows. My determination is fixed; the vessel must proceed on."
               Finding all efforts fruitless, Mr. Eaton raised his eyes to heaven, and, with a
                  bursting heart, and quivering lips, said, in tones which indicated the intense
                  anguish of his spirit,—"O God! teach me to say, 'Thy will be done.'"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               THE VOYAGE.
               IT was a long time before Mrs. Eaton recovered from the shock. Every attention was
                  bestowed upon her by those of her companions who were able to keep out of the
                  berth themselves. When she opened her eyes, she stared vacantly around the cabin,
                  and asked, "Did he bring the lamb back?"
               "Poor woman; the blow was too much for her," said a friend who was bathing her
                  head with vinegar. "I fear her reason has left her."
               The afflicted mother closed her eyes, and fell again into an unquiet sleep. A
                  heavy lurch of the vessel aroused her. She raised her head, and, with a smile upon
                  her face, which contrasted strangely with the wildness of her tear-wet eyes, she
                  said, at the same time holding up her fore finger, "Come, my little bird, and
                  sing;" and then, as if lost between her dream and reality, she fell back upon her
                  pillow, saying, in a whisper, "I thought my bird had come again."
               When Mrs. Eaton had recovered sufficiently to be reasoned with, every
                  consideration was presented to her which was adapted to relieve, to comfort, and
                  to sustain her. And, although her maternal feelings ceased not to be strong and
                  active, yet, through the power of faith in the overruling providence of a wise and
                  gracious God, she was enabled calmly to submit. Being assured by her friends on
                  board that every effort should be made to have Priscilla brought over at the
                  earliest opportunity, she endeavored to feel as if the child had merely gone on a
                  visit, and would return in due time.
               On board the crowded vessel were three ministers,—Messrs. Thomas Hooker, Samuel
                  Stone, and John Cotton,—who had been obliged to leave their fields of labor in
                  consequence of the persecuting edicts of that cruel and despotic prelate,
                  Archbishop Laud. Cotton, who had, like some of the others, come on board very
                  secretly, kept himself concealed for several days, for fear he might be carried
                  back, and delivered into the hands of the merciless and bloodthirsty pursuivants.
                  After the Griffin had pursued her voyage sufficiently far for him to reveal
                  himself with safety, he threw off his concealment, and mingled with the other
                  passengers.
               
               Being now far from the reach of their tyrannical government, they gratefully
                  availed themselves of their liberty to hold religious meetings, which, in the
                  popular parlance of the day, would have been stigmatized as conventicles,
                  Generally, during the whole voyage, public services were held, not only every day,
                  but three times a day. Mr. Cotton preached in the morning, Mr. Hooker in the
                  afternoon, and Mr. Stone in the evening. Many of these were precious seasons.
                  Nothing unusual occurred during the voyage, except the interesting advent of an
                  infant, which Mrs. Cotton presented her husband, who was highly delighted with the
                  gift, having been denied such blessings for the long period of twenty years. In
                  allusion to the place of his birth, the little stranger was christened Sea-born
                  Cotton.
               After being tossed upon the ocean for seven weeks, experiencing the usual
                  vicissitudes of a voyage across the Atlantic, the passengers were greeted from the
                  mast head with the cheering cry of "Land! land!" "Land! land!" was repeated below,
                  and immediately all the party who were convalescent were upon the deck, straining
                  their eyes to catch the first glimpse of the new world.
               A long gray streak was seen in the west, like a cloud resting upon the surface of
                  the ocean. It required an experienced eye to tell whether it was fog or land.
               "That's Gosnold's fishing ground," said the captain. "Because he caught plenty of
                  codfish there he gave it the odd name of Cape Cod."
               "Has it any other name?"
               "Not now. Captain Henry Hudson was here in 1609, and, under the impression that it
                  was an island, be called it New Holland. The French call it Cap Blanc, or White
                  Cape, because, as you will soon see, it is covered with hills of white sand."
               In a few hours the cape, with its glistening. sand hills, was passed. The sail
                  through the islands of Boston Harbor was delightful. They were covered with trees.
                  Upon some were small huts, and drawn up on the shore were some native canoes. No
                  lighthouses, standing like sentinels, with white uniforms and glass caps, to guard
                  the harbor, were then seen; neither were there conspicuous buoys, and other
                  artificial signals or landmarks, to guide the mariner into the deepest water. All
                  the features were Nature's own. Presently the town hove in sight. It was a village
                  of rude houses, of various shapes and sizes, at the base of three hills, with a
                  few huts scattered upon their sides, as
                  if they had left home in order to make a visit, or were wandering off from the
                  town, in search of adventures.
               A crowd had assembled upon the shore, to welcome their brethren and friends from
                  home, and in the course of a few hours, they were all temporarily provided for by
                  the residents of the town.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE DISAPPOINTMENT.
               To return to Priscilla: After she had taken leave of her cousins, to whom she
                  promised to send some Indian curiosities from the new world, she returned to the
                  house, missing her father, who, through another street, was at the same time going
                  to her cousins' for her. Finding no one at the house, she started, as her mother
                  had bidden her, for the wharf. It being dark, and meeting some drunken sailors,
                  she became frightened. She therefore changed her course, and attempted to reach
                  the wharf by passing through other streets. In so doing, she became confused, lost
                  her way, and could not find the place of embarkation until after the last boat had
                  left. She saw its light, as it rose and fell with the waves; but it was impossible
                  for her to reach it, or make those on board hear. Soon the light disappeared, and
                  she gave up all hope.
               Whilst crying, in the bitterness of her grief, a gentleman addressed her in a kind
                     manner, and asked her why she cried.
                  He soon learned all the facts. "Good! good!" said he to himself. "I'll have him
                  now. The slimy Puritan who slipped through my fingers like an eel shall find that
                  I have other bait for him, and a hook that will hold.
               "Never mind, my little girl; stop your crying, and to-morrow morning I will send
                  for your father to come for you."
               "Can't you send me aboard the vessel?"
               "Why so, my dear?"
               "Because I don't think father will want to come ashore again. The officers are
                  after him; they came to our house this afternoon, and searched it for him."
               "And why didn't they find him?"
               "Because mother saw them coming, and she put him under a barrel, and then set the
                  things for tea on the barrel's head; so they did not look under it."
               "Ay, ay; that was the way she barrelled him, like a herring, was it?" thought he.
                  "It was too bad to be within the width of a stave of him, and yet lose him. And
                  then his insolence in referring to that interview on the wharf, as if I were a
                  lion, and he were bearding me. It is too much for human nature to bear."
               However, he said nothing of the kind.
               "Well, my little girl, you had better go home with me to-night, and in the morning
                  I will either send for your father, or take you on board."
               As both of these measures were prevented by the speedy departure of the vessel,
                  the little girl could not be used as a decoy.
               As, however, she had no relatives who could provide for her, the officer took her
                  to London, and placed her in a family of strong Episcopalians, in order to
                  withdraw her entirely from Puritan influence. Here the poor child experienced but
                  little sympathy, except from one of the children of the family, with whom, when
                  not engaged at work, she was always a welcome playmate. It was the youngest son,
                  whose name was Stephen Williamson. Yet there was something in Priscilla's
                  appearance that uniformly attracted the attention of strangers.
               She was tall for one of her years, with shoulders which gradually tapered to a
                  delicate neck; a slender waist, though not from artificial means; limbs delicately
                  rounded; a nose slightly Grecian; dark, full, speaking eyes; black hair, which
                  could be easily made to fall straight or in flowing, raven ringlets; and a
                  healthful dark complexion, tending to the brunette. There was an archness and winning pleasantness in
                  her manners that always secured for her the favorable opinions of others at first
                  sight.
               In disposition she was affectionate, frank, and benevolent. She was not perfect.
                  She was at times high spirited and firm, even to obstinacy. When occasion required
                  it, she could exhibit both physical and moral courage to a high degree. She was
                  old enough to understand the reasons of her parents' trials, and why they had been
                  obliged to flee from England. So frequently had she listened to accounts of the
                  persecutions of the Puritans by the tyrannical Laud, that, child as she was, she
                  had come to hate the Establishment with a perfect hatred, and to believe that the
                  Puritans were the true people of God. Her mother had taken great pains to instil
                  into her mind the truths of the Bible, so that, from a child, she might know the
                  Holy Scriptures, which were able to make her wise unto salvation. It was her
                  parents' desire that, like Priscilla of old, (after whom, according to the custom
                  of the Puritans to adopt Scripture names in their families, she had been called,)
                  she might, as opportunity offered, be able to teach others the way of the Lord
                  more perfectly.
               After she was placed in the family of the Williamsons, such was her aversion to
                  all Episcopal forms and ceremonies, and especially to the use of the prayer book,
                  that she never would attend church, unless compelled so to do by the threats of
                  her mistress. And when there, she obstinately refused to read the prayers. She so
                  managed as never to be able to keep the place; and sometimes, when the book was
                  held by her and Mrs. Williamson, she would contrive to let a few leaves slip over,
                  so as to lose the place, and thus subject her mistress to the inconvenience of
                  finding it again; Priscilla, in the mean time, secretly enjoying the embarrassment
                  she had produced.
               To encourage her to study the principles of the church, Mrs. Williamson one day
                  told her if she would commit the Thirty-nine Articles of the church to memory, she
                  would give her a beautiful present.
               "I can't do it," said Priscilla; "it would take me thirty-nine years."
               "Well, then, if you will go to church all through Lent, you shall have it."
               "I don't want to go," said Priscilla; "but if it is something really beautiful,
                  and I can't have it without, I will go."
               
               "It is," said her mistress; "and there is gold about it too."
               Through fog, and mud, and rain, and crowds of dirty people, and dripping 
                     umberllas,
                     umbrellas
                   with an occasional Godsend of a fair day, Priscilla attended church all
                  through Lent, thinking all the time what the beautiful present would be. "Perhaps
                  it will be a dear little workbox, or a beautiful cloak with gold clasps,
                  or—or—what can it be?"
               After her irksome task of church attendance was completed, Mrs. Williamson entered
                  the kitchen, and told her she had been a good girl, and she had brought her the
                  present, at the same time reaching forth a little package. Priscilla, with a
                  cheerful countenance, and her eyes glistening with joy received it with an
                  embarrassed "Thank you." But so soon as she had opened it, and saw what it was,
                  she threw it from her, and burst into tears. The poor girl was grievously
                  disappointed.
               "Why, Priscilla, I'm astonished," said her mistress.
               "I thought it was to be something beautiful, and it's only a prayer book, and I
                  don't want a prayer book."
               "But it has gold upon it Priscilla."
               "It is nothing but a gilt cross upon the cover, and my father always said that a
                  cross was a sign of Popery. He despised it."
               "But your father was a rank Puritan."
               "My father is a good man," said the spirited little girl, whose disappointment and
                  anger were increased by this insinuation of her mistress, "and what if he is a
                  Puritan; he never put people in prison because they differed from him, nor made
                  parents run away and leave their children to strangers because they would not
                  perform ceremonies which they believed were wicked."
               "But Puritans are heretics, and deserve to be punished," said Mrs. Williamson.
               "Well, then, I'm a Puritan, and I mean to be a Puritan," replied Priscilla, with
                  her anger rising. "I'll have my father's religion."
               "You little heretic, pick up that prayer book, or I'll have you punished."
               The conversation was now interrupted by. the entrance of Stephen, who seated
                  himself by the table, and leaned his hand upon his head, as if he were ill.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               A DREADFUL SCENE.
               "WHAT'S the matter, Stephen? You look as though you would faint away."
               "I feel so, mother, for I have seen a sight enough to make us all faint," replied
                  he, drawing, at the same time, a deep sigh.
               "What was that, my son?"
               "I have been to Westminster, and have seen Dr. Leighton abused and mangled as
                  though he were a worthless dog."
               "But you know, my son, he is a heretic, and has written a book against our learned
                  and godly prelates. He merits punishment."
               "But not such punishment, for they treated him as if they were savages. They first
                  severely whipped him. O, how the blows sounded, as they fell upon his back and cut
                  into his flesh! Then they set him in the pillory, and a great, coarse, brutal man,
                  who looked like a pirate, came and cut off one of his ears, and gashed a slit in
                  his nose. After this, and while his face and back were all covered with blood, a
                  red-hot iron was brought, which they pressed against his cheek, until the smoke of
                  his burning flesh rose above his head. A man in the crowd said they were burning
                  the letters S. S. into his cheek, to signify 'Sower of Sedition.'"
               "Then he might let the prelacy alone, and not slander our bishops by calling them
                  'men of blood.'"
               "If that was a slander before, I'm sure it is not now. By their cruelty to him
                  they have proved that they are 'men of blood.' And they have not done with him
                  yet, for to-day seven-night he is to be carried to Cheapside, and there have the
                  same cruelties repeated—his other nostril will be slit, his other ear cut off, and
                  his other cheek branded. They say that when this horrible sentence was passed upon
                  him in court, Bishop Laud was so well pleased that he took off his cap and gave
                  God thanks for it. Don't you believe, mother, that he is a man of blood?"*

               "Then let the culprit leave off writing wicked books against the church, and
                  attend to other business," replied the mother, with cool indifference.
               But Stephen was not convinced. Possessing as he did, in a high degree, a natural
                     sense of justice, for one sect of
                  Christians to persecute, in this cruel manner, another sect, for a mere difference
                  of opinion, was to him abhorrent.
               "If religion approves of all this," said he, "it seems to me that the more a man
                  has of it the worse he is."
               Priscilla, who had reluctantly picked up the obnoxious prayer book and laid it on
                  the table, had listened with deep interest to Stephen's relation, and was thinking
                  of what would probably have been the sufferings of her father if he had been taken
                  by the officers of government.
               She was aroused from her revery by Mrs. Williamson saying to her in a petulant
                  tone of voice, "As you don't like my present, miss, you need not keep it." She
                  then took the book, and left the kitchen.
               The two children being left together, Priscilla related to Stephen her
                  disappointment, and the conversation she had just had with his mother.
               He told her to never mind, and he would get her a present himself. The truth was,
                  his sympathies were with her, and he could not help condemning his mother's craft
                  and severity towards her.
               Priscilla, as she thought of her parents far away, and how differently she was
                  treated here from what she had been at home, could not refrain from weeping. Her
                  tears brought tears in the eyes of Stephen. They wept together.
               A few days after this, Stephen slipped in Priscilla's hand a little package, with
                  her name written upon it, saying, "Don't let mother see it." She hastened to her
                  room, opened the package, and found it to be a beautiful needle book, containing
                  needles, scissors, stiletto, and bodkin. On the outside of it was a small plate of
                  silver, on which was engraved "S. to P." As she unrolled it, and one article after
                  another presented themselves to view, she soliloquized, "How thoughtful! just what
                  I wanted. O, how good he is." After looking at it many times, and kissing it again
                  and again, she laid it away in her trunk.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER.
               PRISCILLA remained in the family of Mrs. Williamson several years, doing the
                  hardest work, and subjected to various kinds of annoyances on account of her
                  puritanical preferences. Nothing could induce her to express satisfaction with the
                  Episcopal forms of church service.
               She thought much of her parents, but all her efforts to hear from them proved
                  abortive. When they left England, they had not decided in what part of the new
                  world to settle, and therefore she knew not how to direct to them a letter. She
                  could derive no assistance from Mr. or Mrs. Williamson, as it was their policy,
                  and to their interest, to keep her ignorant of her parents' place of
                  residence.
               One day, when in her little attic chamber, busily engaged with her needle, as she
                  raised her eyes and saw a vessel slowly sailing down the Thames, she wondered
                  whether it was going to America; and then, whether, if she had written a letter to
                  her parents, it might not have taken it direct to them. These led to other
                  thoughts, until she startled herself with the suggestion, "Is it not possible for
                     me to go to America?" This thought, once definitely formed,
                  haunted her incessantly. When about her work, or at church, or upon her pillow,
                  she was pondering upon this all-important project, and endeavoring to devise some
                  method for its accomplishment. At last she deliberately formed the resolution that
                  if any means presented themselves by which it could be effected, she, would go,
                  and trust to Providence about finding her parents after her arrival.
               Not only were her Puritan tendencies known to Mrs. Williamson and all who visited
                  the family, but also to a few others in the city possessing similar tendencies.
                  She had managed to become acquainted with a few Puritans, from whom she
                  occasionally received scraps of interesting information, and by whom her
                     dissenting inclinations were kept alive.
               "Well, Priscilla, can, I trust you with a secret?" said Mrs. Hope Mitchel, one of
                  these friends, to her, one day, when she had run in to chat for a few moments.
               "If it's puritanic, you can; I never divulge them."
               
               "It is all puritanic, and if it should be revealed, our whole scheme might be
                  defeated."
               "You may trust me, then; I shall never disclose it."
               "Well, then, Priscilla, we are going to America."
               "Going to America!" exclaimed she, with surprise, and with some degree of hope;
                  "when?"
               "We expect to get off to-night."
               "In what vessel?"
               "In the Reindeer, which lies at Gould's Wharf, at the bottom of Thames Street. We
                  have been some weeks secretly getting ready, and to-day we shall have all our
                  things taken on board."
               Priscilla burst into tears. "O, why did you not let me know it before?" said
                  she.
               "Because we were charged to keep it strictly confidential. Besides, I did not know
                  that it would make the least difference to you."
               "I might have contrived to go, too."
               "If I had thought there was the least probability of that, I would have let you
                  know from the very first. I am truly sorry that it is now too late."
               "Are there others going?"
               "Yes; some forty or more, all told."
               Priscilla's determination was instantly formed.
               After further conversation, in which she told Mrs. Mitchel to make diligent
                  inquiries after her parents, and if she ever found them to tell them her
                  condition, and that a letter addressed to her, to the care of John Williamson,
                  London, would reach her, she bade her an affectionate farewell, and left, with
                  tears streaming down her cheeks.
               That night, the Reindeer dropped down the Thames, and in a few hours was out to
                  sea. All of the passengers were Puritans, and were fleeing from the persecutions
                  of Laud to a land where they could worship God according to the dictates of their
                  own consciences, without the fear of either secular or ecclesiastical power. They
                  were seeking religious liberty. The party consisted of individuals of various
                  dispositions and peculiarities. Some were wholly occupied with themselves, some
                  with their children, and a few were busily employed in seeking after the general
                  good of the company. Amongst the latter was an old lady of the name of Strangger,
                  about sixty years of age, small, thin, somewhat bent, but active, talkative, and
                  affectionately curious to know the history of the different individuals of the
                  company, which was composed of different groups of Puritans, who were previously unknown to each
                  other. The way the old lady managed to obtain her information was to inquire of
                  one about the others. She seldom drew out from individuals their own history, but
                  by ingenious questioning she obtained from them all they knew about the others; so
                  that, although the company was composed of different sets or parties, she
                  contrived to become pretty well acquainted with the most of them in a few days.
                  She was also very observant of their conduct.
               "Who is that person looking over the side of the vessel?" said she to a lady by
                  the side of whom she had taken her seat one clear day.
               "I do not know."
               "It's very strange," said the old woman, musingly. "I have asked nearly every lady
                  on board, and they all make the same answer. Nobody seems to know her. I have
                  watched her closely for the last two days, and she behaves so strangely I do not
                  know what to make of her."
               "I dare say she feels badly at leaving her native home."
               "So do I, and so, I suppose, do you, but we don't act as she does. She seems to
                  care for nobody, and nobody cares for her. I have watched her for the last three
                  days, and haven't seen her speak to a single person on board. She keeps her face
                  covered up the most of the time with a thick veil. She hasn't been to the table
                  once since she has been on board. Where she sleeps I can't tell, for I know who
                  occupy all the ladies' berths. I've made up my mind she is a mystery."
               The person to whom this conversation had reference was a young woman some eighteen
                  years of age, dressed in a dark gown, a thick, coarse cloth cloak, and bonnet,
                  with a thick green veil. As she turned her face from the water, and looked towards
                  the speakers, they were surprised.
               "She is really beautiful," said the lady. "What full, liquid eyes, and smooth,
                  black hair!"
               "Yes, yes," said Mrs. Strangger; "but beauty is dangerous. It is often a fatal
                  snare."
               "I think she looks very pensive," said the lady; "she has been weeping."
               "Perhaps she has been doing something for which she ought to weep. It wouldn't be
                  the first beautiful girl that had done so."
               "O I hope not, and I can't think so," said the lady; "there is something in that
                  countenance which deeply interests me."
               
               Mrs. Mitchel now came on deck, and the unknown covered her face and turned her
                  head away.
               "Do you know that person?" said Mrs. Strangger to Mrs. Mitchel.
               "I do not. I have tried a number of times to see her face, but have been 
                     uusuccessful.
                     unsuccessful
                   I feel my heart drawn towards her, for she seems very lonely. Why not
                  speak to her?"
               "I have tried that," replied Mrs. Strangger, "several times; but she seems
                  impatient. She acts as though she did not want to be spoken to."
               "See! she is writing."
               "She can't write much on that slip of paper."
               The unknown changed her position, and removed to a place near the cabin door,
                  keeping her face so thickly veiled that her features could not be seen.
               As Mrs. Mitchel approached the cabin to descend, the mysterious lady arose, and in
                  a manner that escaped the detection of the others, she slipped into her hand the
                  piece of paper on which she had been writing, and immediately passed on.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE MYSTERY SOLVED.
               As soon as Mrs. Mitchel had entered the cabin, she opened the paper, and
                  read,—
               "Dear Mrs. Mitchel, will you favor me with an interview this evening, at nine
                  o'clock, on the quarter deck."
               "What does this mean?" said she to herself. "She knows me, and writes as though
                  she was somewhat familiar with me; and yet she neither signs her name, nor shows
                  me her face. There is something dark about this. However, I'll grant her the
                  interview, and have the mystery solved."
               At nine o'clock, Mrs. Mitchel left the cabin, and ascended to the quarter deck. It
                  was a beautiful, serene evening; the rays of the full moon fell upon the waves of
                  the ocean, tipping them all with silver. The ship was sailing steadily through the
                  water, before a gentle breeze, with its shadow by its side, as though it were an
                  inseparable companion. A few of the passengers were lingering about different parts of the vessel, enjoying the
                  pleasant quiet and refreshing coolness of the night.
               Presently the unknown came from the other side of the ship, where, for a long
                  time, she had been impatiently waiting for the appointed hour to arrive, and all
                  the while in painful suspense, not knowing whether her request would be complied
                  with or not. She took a seat by Mrs. Mitchel, and convulsively seized her hand,
                  saying, in trembling tones, and with a mixture of indescribable emotions, "O Mrs.
                  Mitchel, I am here!" at the same time drawing aside her veil, and revealing the
                  familiar features of Priscilla Eaton.
               "Why, Priscilla! is it you?"
               The poor girl was overcome. Her long-stifled feelings now found vent. She burst
                  into tears, fell upon her friend's neck, and sobbed like a child.
               After she became sufficiently composed, and had answered a few general inquiries,
                  she gave her friend the following narrative:—
               "When, in our last interview, you told me that you expected to set sail that
                  night, I instantly made up my mind to go with you, if I could possibly get away,
                  let the consequence be what it might. I had endured the tyranny of the Williamsons
                  long enough; and I have always believed that if I could only get to America, I
                  should find my parents. O, how much my dear mother must have suffered since she
                  lost me!" Her sobs choked her utterance. In a few moments she resumed. "Well, as
                  soon as I left you, I went to my trunk, took some money which I had been a long
                  time saving, purchased this cloak and veil, as much to disguise myself as for any
                  other reason, and also a quantity of crackers and cheese. I then went home,
                  selected a few articles which I thought would be indispensable on the voyage, and
                  tied them up into as small a bundle as possible. When I had gotten all ready, I
                  went about the house, and attended to my duties with as much apparent cheerfulness
                  as usual, to prevent all suspicion. About nine o'clock, I took my bundle from my
                  room, went down stairs as silently as possible, left the house through the back
                  door, and hastened down Thames Street to Gould's Wharf. There I was at a loss to
                  know which was the Reindeer. I did not dare to speak, for fear of being
                  misdirected, insulted, or detected. So I waited, in great trepidation, with my
                  bundle under my cloak, for about half an hour, during which several small parties
                  passed by me silently, and entered on board one of the vessels, which appeared to
                  be nearly ready to sail. That, I thought,
                  was the Reindeer; but still I was not certain. Finally, I heard a voice which I
                  thought I recognized. I listened attentively, and satisfied myself that it was
                  yours. O, how my heart throbbed! As soon as you had passed by where I stood
                  concealed by the shadow of a pile of merchandise, I followed; and you may depend I
                  kept as close to you as I could, without being perceived. As there were quite a
                  number of passengers on board, I managed to pass around amongst them unnoticed,
                  each one supposing I belonged to some other party, with whom they were not
                  acquainted. O, how glad was I when the vessel left the wharf! Till then I thought
                  I might possibly return. But after that I felt greatly relieved. Still, I have
                  been in a state of painful suspense till the present time. I have paid no passage.
                  I have not been registered among the passengers. I have smuggled myself on board.
                  And what will be the result when the captain discovers it, I know not. I
                  determined to keep myself concealed until we were so far on the voyage that there
                  was no probability of the captain's returning with me, and that then I would make
                  a confidant of you."
               "But how have you lived all this time, Priscilla? for I have not seen you at the
                  table once."
               "I brought crackers and cheese enough in my bundle to last me till now, and you
                  know we have plenty of water on board to drink. But"—and she wept again—"I ate my
                  last cracker to-day."
               "Where have you slept?"
               "As to that, I have had no difficulty. I have waited till all the passengers had
                  retired for the night, and then I have disposed of myself upon the chairs, trunks,
                  or other articles in the cabin, where I have remained, wrapped in my cloak, which
                  I bought for that very purpose, till morning. If I did not get as much sleep
                  during the night as I needed, I made it up the next day, as I had nothing else to
                  do."
               The conversation was here interrupted by the captain and mate coming upon the
                  quarter deck, and walking to and fro before them.
               "There is some dishonest craft here," said the captain, sufficiently loud to be
                  heard by the two women. "These cursed hypocritical Puritans would skin your teeth
                  for you. They will always tell the truth when a lie won't answer their purpose
                  just as well. But they will find themselves mistaken if they attempt to get around
                  me."
               "Are you sure that you have detected them?" asked the mate.
               
               "Certainly. A passage was negotiated for twenty-four men, nineteen women, and
                  seven children, all of whose names have been given me; and now I find there are
                  twenty women on board."
               Priscilla squeezed the hand of her friend, which she still held, to direct
                  attention to the conversation of the two men.
               "To-morrow," said the captain, angrily, "I'll find out who it is that they've
                  smuggled here, if I have to pitch them all overboard."
               The two women trembled as they heard this threat. They knew that the captain was a
                  profane, high-tempered, ungodly man, destitute of all respect for their
                  principles, and who had been secretly induced to bring them over by a large bonus.
                  They knew not what he might do when he should discover who was the guilty
                  person.
               "I don't blame Laud for dealing with these fanatical hypocrites with a high hand.
                  It's the only way to manage them. I'm glad that the Star Chamber and High
                  Commission have them in tow. They'll find that they will have to pay such high
                  duties on their cargoes of sanctified wickedness as will make it poor freight for
                  them. To-morrow I'll fix them."
               "O Mrs. Mitchel! what shall I do? Tomorrow morrow will be a dreadful day to me!
                  But there!" added she, as if she had suddenly recalled a forgotten truth, "I knew
                  before I started that I should be discovered on the voyage, and I made up my mind
                  to meet the detection with calmness; but I determined to avoid it until there was
                  no danger of being returned; but I can't be concealed after to-morrow."
               Her first impulse was to throw herself upon her knees before the captain, tell the
                  whole truth, and cast herself upon his mercy. But she was deterred by hearing his
                  remarks, and seeing his angry spirit. She feared that he might not possess mercy,
                  and then she would be throwing herself into the power of the lion. She preferred
                  to wait for the natural issue of an event on which she had calculated, but which
                  she had made no provisions to surmount.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               AN ACCUSATION.
               THE two women remained a long time on deck. As they went below, Mrs. Mitchel told
                  Priscilla to fix herself as tidily as possible on the morrow; to leave off her
                  veil, and go around among the passengers, and walk upon the deck, as though she
                  had not the least objection to being seen. "I think it will operate a great deal
                  better for you when you are discovered."
               The truth is, from her knowledge of human nature, she believed that if Priscilla
                  should become a little known, the beauty of her personal appearance, combined with
                  her benevolent disposition, would operate favorably upon the captain and upon the
                  passengers.
               As they parted for the night,—Mrs. Mitchel to her berth, and Priscilla to find a
                  resting-place where she could,—the former whispered, "Put thy trust in God,
                  Priscilla, and he will deliver thee." It was a word of consolation.
               That night the poor girl was a stranger to sleep. Excited, nervous, unhappy, how
                  could she sleep? She thought of her past history—her early home, her beloved
                  parents, her painful separation from them. She thought of her trials among the
                  Williamsons, and of the manner of her departure from them. She thought of her
                  temerity in doing what she had done, and of the peculiarities and perils of her
                  present condition. She thought of Stephen, and wondered how he felt about her
                  leaving—whether he had shed a tear for her; whether he had been to her room and
                  taken any little thing therefrom as a token of remembrance; and then she put her
                  hand into her pocket to see if his present to her was there; for she was
                  determined not to part with that until the last extremity. And then the
                  threatening language of the captain occurred to her mind. "O," said she, "what
                  will be on the morrow?" A flood of tears was the only answer. She had no plan
                  formed, no story to tell, no bribe to offer. She felt as if she were a feather
                  upon the billows, and knew not where the next wave would toss her. At this time
                  Priscilla was not a Christian. She yielded an intellectual assent to the doctrines
                  of grace, but she had never submitted to their power. She was not, therefore,
                  sustained by religious consolations. Neither did she exercise Christian
                  resignation. When she anticipated what
                  she knew would be the inevitable disclosure of the morrow, it was with a spirit of
                  natural firmness and determination to go through it with fortitude. She fully
                  appreciated the difficulty of her position. She knew the suspicions which would
                  fall upon those who had negotiated for the passage of the company, and the
                  readiness of the captain to charge upon them deliberate fraud; but she resolved to
                  exonerate them entirely at any hazard to herself. "Their characters, dearer to
                  them than life, shall not suffer on my account," said she. That which afforded the
                  most relief was the improbability of the captain's returning with her. They were
                  now so far from home, she did not believe he could be induced to return on any
                  account.
               The morning arrived. It was cloudy, but mild and calm. According to the suggestion
                  of Mrs. Mitchel, Priscilla was attired as neatly as her scanty wardrobe would
                  allow. Her veil was thrown aside; a neat collar was worn over her dark dress; her
                  hair was arranged plainly, but in good taste; and her bonnet, whose trimming she
                  had improved before the other passengers were awake, was put on as carefully as
                  though she were going to make a ceremonious call.
               Her appearance on deck, attracted the attention of the sailors. "By George! that's
                  a beauty," said one of the hands to another, on the forward deck.
               "You are right; what a graceful form!"
               "Yes; and that face too. Did you ever see such rich eyes?"
               "Ay, ay, Bill, I think your true love will have to yield the palm to her."
               "She looks pensive withal."
               "So she does; but then she walks like a queen."
               "Too much so to be the wife of any of these drawling, whining fanatics on
                  board."
               At a later period in the forenoon, as she was walking arm in arm with an invalid
                  lady, she was observed by the captain. He was so favorably impressed with her
                  appearance that he approached, and entered into conversation with her. Priscilla
                  was fully alive to the importance of getting into his "good graces." She managed,
                  therefore, to give such a turn to the conversation, and to demean herself in such
                  a manner, as to make the most desirable impression upon his mind. She ingeniously
                  labored to secure his good opinion and sympathies, without, however, relating her
                  history. The longer the captain conversed with her, the more deeply was he interested. She exhibited such
                  native good sense, amiableness of manner, winning address, and pensive tenderness,
                  combined with such great beauty of person, that he was for a season chained to her
                  side. "If I were not a married man," said he to himself, "I couldn't be proof
                  against charms like hers. She is the jewel of the company."
               As the passengers began to congregate upon the deck, the captain pleasantly said
                  to her, "Excuse me; I have some unpleasant business to attend to now, but shall be
                  happy to resume conversation with you another time." Priscilla knew more about the
                  unpleasant business than the captain himself.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE DETECTION.
               PRESENTLY the mate brought a small table on deck, with ink, pens, and paper.
               "Now," said the captain, we must attend to business. I want all the passengers
                  called on deck, old and young, male and female." The order was carried below, and
                  in a few minutes the whole number were before him.
               "My agreement was, to carry twenty-four men, nineteen women, and seven children. I
                  am afraid," said he, "there has been some confounded"—he would have added "fraud;"
                  but at that instant his eye fell upon Priscilla, whose forlorn appearance made
                  such an impression upon him that he substituted "mistake, or something worse."
               After looking upon the paper a moment, he raised his eyes, and said, with an
                  unusual degree of sternness, "I contracted to carry over nineteen women, and I
                  find twenty are here. There is an attempt to steal a passage, to smuggle across;
                  and I want to find out who it is."
               
               The passengers were now all excited. One of the men declared it couldn't be. They
                  intended to be strictly fair and honest, and he indignantly repudiated the idea of
                  deception.
               "Well, well, we'll see," said the captain. "I will call over the names of the
                  women, and as I call them they will step over to the starboard side of the ship,"
                  at the same time motioning with his hand the spot designated. "Make room for them,
                  for I want the guilty one to be fairly exposed; and I want you to understand,
                  before I begin, that as soon as I have found out who this woman smuggler is, I
                  shall arrest the progress of the vessel, and not sail another inch; and if her
                  passage isn't paid instantly, I shall return, and deliver her up to the proper
                  officers, and let the law take its course."
               At this announcement, Priscilla turned pale, and nearly fainted away. It was with
                  difficulty that she retained her position. She knew that the crisis was reached;
                  and in a moment more she recovered, and nerved herself to meet it.
               "Now then," said the captain, "pass as your names are called."
               All was silent as the grave, save the noise of the water, as it broke against the
                  ship.
               "Mrs. Experience Strangger." The little, bent, talkative old lady crossed to the
                  starboard side.
               "Mrs. Hope Mitchel;" and Priscilla's friend went over and took her place. Thus the
                  whole were called.
               "That's nineteen, the whole number of women whom I engaged to carry; and now,
                  who's the twentieth—the one for whom you have tried to steal a passage?"
               The captain raised his eyes, and was both surprised and grieved to find that it
                  was Priscilla. There she stood, with a mingled expression of pensiveness, courage,
                  and fortitude clearly depicted upon her countenance. The passengers and the crew
                  gathered around, to obtain a clearer view of their self-invited guest. The modesty
                  of her deportment, the beauty of her countenance, the peculiar, grief-like
                  firmness which was imprinted upon her features awakened for her a general interest
                  among the passengers. There were a few exceptions. Some of the men were highly
                  indignant. They called her an "Achan in the camp," "a troubler of Israel," "a
                  Jezebel;" and became very earnest to convince the captain that her presence on
                  board was not with their connivance. Each party had presumed that she belonged to
                  one of the others; and for that reason none of them had their suspicions awakened,
                  unless it was the talkative little woman.
               
               "I always suspected her," said the loquacious Mrs. Strangger. "I could find out
                  nothing about her, although I inquired of all the passengers. All were strangers
                  to her."
               Various remarks were made by the different persons on board; but as no question
                  was addressed directly to Priscilla, she remained silent.
               The captain now regretted that he had committed himself to a certain course of
                  procedure in case he detected the offender; but, having done so, he felt bound, if
                  for no other reasons, by his own views of self-respect, to make some demonstration
                  that his previous determination should be carried into effect. He therefore gave
                  directions to his mate to arrest the progress of the Reindeer.
               In a few minutes the vessel was brought round, head to the wind. During all this
                  time the intention of the captain was to get over the difficulty as easily as
                  possible. It was his policy to appear determined to go back, unless
                  the passage money for her was paid at once; but, at the same time, to abandon that
                  determination, if it could be done with a good grace. He sympathized with his
                  unfortunate passenger, and had a secret impression that she would not have placed
                  herself in this peculiar situation without some extremely urgent reason.
                     pp. 83 and 84.
                  
                   He sincerely hoped that something would
                  occur which would afford him the opportunity of air honorable retreat from the
                  position he had assumed.
               When the progress of the vessel had been checked, the captain addressed the
                  passengers, in a stern voice, as though he were destitute of all feeling and
                  interest in the matter.
               "You know what to expect. My decision has already been announced. I shall not sail
                  another knot until this matter is settled. Plank down the money for that girl's
                  passage, or expect to be carried back to London. I say, girl, what's your
                  name?"
               "Priscilla Eaton, sir."
               "Who smuggled you on board the vessel?"
               This was just the question that Priscilla wanted to hear, as it gave her an
                  opportunity of speaking, and exonerating the other passengers. Yet, even up to
                  this time, she had no plans laid, and was entirely at a loss what proposal to
                  make. She was determined, however, to be frank, truthful, and dependent. She
                  therefore answered the captain, at the same time looking him calmly in the
                  face,—
               "No one, sir."
               "Have you any money to pay your passage?"
               "No, sir."
               
               "You are in a bad fix, unless the others will pay for you. My owner does not allow
                  me to carry passengers gratuitously."
               "Who is your owner?" inquired one of the others.
               "Mr. John Williamson; and a snug man he is too."
               The moment Priscilla heard this familiar name, her heart sunk within her; but,
                  after a moment's reflection, it furnished her the brightest gleam of hope that she
                  had experienced since she left the wharf. She thought she now discovered a method
                  by which she could be delivered from her present painful embarrassment.
               "How much can you pay towards your passage?" asked the captain.
               "A few shillings are all the money I possess in the world," answered
                  Priscilla.
               "How much can you raise among the passengers? This business must be attended to
                  immediately. I must be sailing one way or the other."
               The passengers, being generally poor, were not disposed nor able to contribute
                  much towards an unwelcome interloper, as they regarded her, although they could
                  not help having their sensibilities moved in her behalf.
               "Five pounds ten shillings are all that can be raised; and this we contribute more
                  to prevent you from going back, than because we would justify this girl, who seems
                  to have erred and strayed like a lost sheep."
               "How do you know that?" said the captain, indignantly. "Cast no unnecessary
                  aspersions upon her. She may be as pure as the best of you, although she does not
                  whine in canting Scripture phrase so much."
               "We have not heard her account of herself," said the inquisitive, little, bent
                  Mrs. Strangger. "I should like to know what brought her here, to interrupt our
                  voyage, and bring us into all this trouble."
               "Very true, old woman," replied the captain. "It may be that the young woman's
                  story will put a new phase upon things. Come, miss, I should be glad to have you
                  tell us who you are, and why you are here."
               Priscilla came forward a couple of steps, where all could see her. The neatness of
                  her dress, the beauty of her form, her calm and regular countenance, with its
                  grief-like expression,—all these, combined with the peculiarity of her condition,
                  served to create favorable prepossessions for her in the minds of the spectators.
                  She was glad of the opportunity of
                  speaking in her own defence. She regarded the dreaded crisis as now fully
                  reached.
               In a clear and musical tone of voice, that harmonized finely with her appearance,
                  she gave a brief statement of her past history;—that her father was a
                  conscientious, upright man; that both he and her mother were firm Puritans; that,
                  because of their religious opinions, they had been severely persecuted, and driven
                  from place to place, until, as a last resort, they had fled to America.
               "And why, young woman, did they leave you behind?" asked the captain.
               Priscilla related the circumstances of their unfortunate separation—her visit to
                  her cousin, her meeting the intoxicated sailors, her losing her way, getting late
                  to the wharf, her screaming after the last boat, the disappearance of the light,
                  her utter loneliness and disappointment, the discovery of a kind man, who took her
                  home with him, the disappearance of the vessel the next morning, her being brought
                  to London, and put in the family of those who cherished a deep hatred of her
                  father's religion, and had but little sympathy for her. She spoke of her love for
                  her mother, her anxiety to see her, her determination to cross the Atlantic at the
                  first opportunity, her providential discovery of Mrs. Mitchel's leaving, and the
                  sailing of the Reindeer, her instant determination to secrete herself on board,
                  and allow no living soul to know it, and then to trust to a kind Providence for a
                  successful issue. "Perhaps," said she, with deep emotion, "I have done wrong; and
                  if so, may God forgive me. But as for these friends," pointing to the other
                  passengers, "they had nothing to do with my coming on board. I exonerate them
                  entirely; the whole responsibility rests upon myself. If there is guilt, I am
                  guilty, not they, for not one of them knew any thing of my intention. And now,
                  sir," said she, addressing the captain, "I throw myself entirely upon your mercy.
                  I ask, I beseech, I implore you not to return. O, sir, go on! Let me cross the
                  Atlantic; let me see my mother! I will live on a cracker a day. I will do any
                  thing in my power, proper for me to do, on board the vessel. I will attend the
                  table; I will assist the cook; I will take care of the children; I will do any
                  thing I am able to that can be reasonably asked of me; but O, sir! abandon the
                  thought of going back. I could not endure that."
               All this was said with so much sincerity, pathos, and tender earnestness, and with
                  such evident suppression of intense emotion, that the whole company became deeply interested for her.
                  The captain, too, was not proof against the appeal. He turned his head, and
                  brushed from his weather-beaten face a tear. Still, his high notions of what he
                  termed consistency and self-respect would not allow him to appear in too much
                  haste to alter his decision.
               "But, my young friend," said he, with all the kindness of a father, "have you not
                  presumed upon good nature too far? How can a compliance with your request be
                  reconciled with my duties to my owner? He is a tight man, and does not wish to
                  lose a dollar."
               "I think you said your owner was Mr. John Williamson," replied Priscilla.
               "I did."
               "Of that I was not before aware; but am glad to learn it now, for I regard Mr.
                  Williamson as indebted to me."
               "Indeed!" says the captain, with great readiness, as though he was anxious to
                  seize upon any thing that would apologize for her conduct, and allow him to
                  proceed on his voyage.
               "Indeed! that entirely alters the case. If Mr. Williamson owes you, then he can
                  charge you for this passage, and in that way, perhaps, can balance accounts. To.
                  what amount is he indebted to you?"
               "I can't tell, sir. The circumstances are these: I was put into his family four
                  years ago, and have remained there ever since. I have had to work hard, and have
                  received no regular wages. I have been furnished with clothes that were both plain
                  and coarse, but not half as many as very moderate wages would have purchased; and
                  even these I left behind, except a very few, which I tied in a bundle, for this
                  voyage. I think, sir, that four years' unpaid services are sufficient to balance
                  at least the price of a passage to America."
               "So do I," said the captain; "but all this is your own assertion. I have no doubt
                  that it is true; still, I require other evidence, in addition to your own
                  statement. If you can prove all this to me, the vessel shall not be checked
                  another minute, but I will proceed at once on our outward voyage."
               At Priscilla's request, Mrs. Mitchel was now called, who corroborated all her
                  statements.
               "That's sufficient," said the captain. "All that remains to be done is, that the
                  statement of all the facts be put upon record, and attested to, so that I may show
                  them to my owner, when I return; but, as that can be done as well when the vessel
                  is under headway as when she is lying still, we need delay our voyage no longer. I
                  am glad this unpleasant business has reached so favorable a termination."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               A HAPPY MEETING.
               THE ship was soon under weigh, after which the necessary papers were drawn up and
                  signed with all due formality. Priscilla was now admitted to the table with the
                  other passengers, and by her amiable spirit, and benevolent attentions to the
                  children and the sick, she soon became a favorite to all on board.
               In a few weeks they reached the coast of America. The first land they saw was the
                  Island of Nantucket. They were on their way to Boston, where Priscilla was in
                  hopes of learning something of her parents; but a violent gale sprang up, which
                  continued several days. It drove them so far south, and injured the vessel so
                  badly, that they were all glad to put into the nearest harbor, which proved to be
                  New Haven, then called by the Indians Quinnipiac. Having been so long at sea, the company rejoiced greatly
                  to land. They were received with a hearty welcome by the settlers, although it was
                  with difficulty that accommodations dations could be found for them. But few
                  houses had been erected, scarcely enough to meet the wants of the colony, and
                  these were small and rough. Some were made of turf, others of logs, and others
                  appeared to be booths of the branches of trees, stuck in the ground and filled in
                  with smaller twigs and leaves. On the inside, coverlets and other cloths were hung
                  up to keep out the wind. These were not the permanent dwellings of the settlers,
                  but temporary cabins, hastily thrown up for their reception, until larger and
                  better ones could be completed, on which the men were busily at work. The
                  unexpected arrival of such a number of emigrants threw the little colony into
                  confusion. As, however, the captain was willing to remain there some time for the
                  accommodation of his passengers, they industriously set themselves to work, and in
                  a few days had huts as good as their neighbors.
               Priscilla's first care was to inquire for her parents. Believing that the minister
                  of the place would be most likely to be acquainted with their place of residence,
                  she sought an interview with him. The pastor of the colony at this time was Rev.
                  John Davenport. He had been a famous minister in London, and was a man of learning and piety. Like the others,
                  he had come to America in order to escape the tyrannical oppressions of the
                  government at home. He sought a place where there was freedom to worship God
                  without the dictation of "the powers that be." He was, however, too well
                  acquainted with the depraved nature of man to expect that escape from persecution
                  would be attended with an entire deliverance from temptation. Hence, on the first
                  Sabbath after the arrival of his company at New Haven, when they were all
                  assembled under the spreading branches of a large old oak, he delivered to them a
                  sermon from Matthew iv. 1, "Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the
                  wilderness to be tempted of the devil." In this discourse he showed what were the
                  temptations of the wilderness, pointed out the best means of resisting them, and
                  urged a variety of motives to resistance. It was an appropriate, timely
                  sermon.
               On him Priscilla called, and inquired if he knew any thing about her father, Mr.
                  Abel Eaton.
               "I do not, my young friend, but perhaps I can aid you in learning something of
                  him. One of the leading men of our colony is named Eaton, and, like your father,
                  he is named after one of the good old saints of the Bible, Samuel."
               "Good, good," said the earnest girl, with tears of joy standing in her eyes.
                  "Where is he? Can I see him now?"
               "Yes, I can show him to you from this small window."
               Priscilla rose, and looked out of a small, square hole between the logs of the
                  cabin.
               "That is he, with a red flannel shirt, felling that ash tree," said the minister,
                  as he pointed out a woodman, hard at work within a few rods of the house.
               "Thank you," exclaimed the excited girl, and away she flew, like a young
                  gazelle.
               "That's he, that's he," said she to herself, as she approached the man, who,
                  having seen a strange young woman hastily advancing towards him, had left his axe
                  sticking in the tree after the last blow, and had raised himself erect to wait for
                  her message.
               "O uncle Samuel, it's me, it's me," exclaimed Priscilla, half wild with joy. "I am
                  so glad to find somebody I know, in this strange, new world;" and she clasped him,
                  and sobbed aloud.
               "Why, Priscilla, is it you? Have you risen from the grave, or dropped down from
                     heaven? This seems like a dream. We
                  thought that you were dead. Your parents wrote to me again and again, entreating
                  me, in the most earnest manner, to seek you and send you over. I did seek. I
                  inquired, and wrote, and travelled, wherever I thought there was the least
                  prospect of hearing of you; but all in vain. The only information I ever obtained
                  was, that after your parents left the wharf, you came down, too late to go with
                  them, and, whilst crying bitterly, some kind man took you away; but who he was, or
                  where he went, I never could learn. We had given up all thoughts of ever seeing
                  you."
               The greetings of the uncle, though more reserved, were as sincere and as deep-felt
                  as those of the niece.
               "Come, let us go to the minister's, and return thanks to Almighty God for this
                  blessed, unexpected meeting." The good pastor, who had watched all their movements
                  from the little square window of his log cabin, where Priscilla had left him, was
                  well pleased to see them coming towards him. He went to the door to welcome them.
                  "Pastor, this is my brother's daughter, from whom he has been separated some four
                  or five years, without hearing a word from her until we had given her up as dead.
                  She has just arrived in the Reindeer, and God has providentially brought us
                  together. It is meet that we should return thanks."
               They entered the cabin, and, after a few more words of explanation, the good
                  pastor said it was a special providence, and the whole company of planters ought
                  to be called together to unite with them in thanksgiving.
               This was accordingly done. When the whole colony had assembled together, Mr.
                  Davenport related the circumstances, and then offered earnest thanksgiving to God
                  for his mercy in bringing these relatives together after so long a separation.
               The whole company listened with devout attention whilst these expressions of
                  fervent gratitude were poured out, that the lost was found, and she who was the
                  same as dead was restored to life, love, and friends. He also added fervent prayer
                  that she might so acknowledge the Lord that he would direct her steps unto her
                  parents, and thus fill their hearts with joy. It was a most interesting scene.
                  There was Priscilla, standing between her uncle and aunt; around were grouped the
                  men and women of the colony, just as they had come from their work; mingled
                     among them were a few Indians and
                  squaws, half dressed in embroidered skins, with beads around their necks, and
                  showy feathers in their hair. The cabin being too small for their accommodation,
                  they were in the open air, under the shadows of the trees, through which a few
                  rays of the sun managed to find their way, and ornament the grass with fleckered
                  spots, which (as the breeze from the bay gently stirred the leaves) changed their
                  shape, and moved about as though they were ornaments of silver. And whilst the
                  good pastor was engaged in his act of devotion, strange birds of various plumage
                  were flitting overhead, and mingling their melodious notes with his voice, as
                  though, in sympathy with him and the occasion, they were executing a thanksgiving
                  anthem.
               "Well, I do declare," said the talkative, crooked little Mrs. Strangger, "who'd
                  have thought, that after all the trouble her mysterious conduct gave us at the
                  first of our voyage, it would have come out like this?"
               "True enough," replied Mrs. Mitchel, to whom the question was addressed. "Yet I
                  always believed it would come out right, for I knew Priscilla intended nothing
                  wrong."
               "And what a prayer!" interrupted the little woman; "so rich and edifying; why, it
                  was as nourishing and strengthening to the soul as roast beef is to the body."
               "It was certainly very earnest and spiritual. He is a godly man, and knoweth well
                  how to get hold of the horns of the altar."
               "Yes, yes, he's a man to storm heaven, and take it by violence," continued Mrs.
                  Strangger. "Did you notice Priscilla during the prayer? Although the tears were
                  falling from her eyes, her countenance was so calm, benevolent, and beautiful, she
                  reminded me of an angel who had lost her wings by coming in contact with the
                  earth."
               Various other remarks were made by different members of the company, all of which,
                  however, indicated a special interest in the heroine of our story, which was
                  increased in proportion as they became acquainted with her character.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               A SINGULAR PRESENT.
               MR. SAMUEL EATON, the uncle of Priscilla, with whom she so unexpectedly met, was
                  formerly a merchant in London, and had amassed a handsome fortune. He had also
                  occupied official positions of great responsibility, having been deputy governor
                  of the East India Company, and ambassador from the government of England to the
                  King of Denmark. For three years he had resided in the East Indies. He was a man
                  of varied experience, great talents for business, and of sterling integrity. It
                  was a most favorable providence that Priscilla was so early thrown under his care,
                  upon her arrival in a land of strangers.
               From him she received the most gratifying intelligence that her parents were in
                  Boston, and were in the enjoyment of health, though they had mourned solely on
                  account of her loss.
               "I must go to them immediately," said she; "I feel as though I could not wait
                  another moment."
               "You could not find the way there, my child," replied her uncle; "it would be
                  dangerous to attempt to cross the country even with an escort of Indians, and
                  communication by water is of rare occurrence."
               "But cannot something be done, uncle? Could you not in some way get word to my
                  parents of my safe arrival. Perhaps father would come for me."
               "I have thought of that, Priscilla, and in a few days an arrangement of that kind,
                  I think, can be made."
               "O, how impatient I am! Those few days will seem like so many years; and then,"
                  added she, in a desponding tone, "I shall have to wait longer for their
                  return."
               At her uncle's suggestion Priscilla immediately commenced a letter to her parents,
                  in which she gave a minute account of her whole history since their separation,
                  and of her deep and poignant grief that she had been unable to hold correspondence
                  with them, because of the impossibility of learning where they were. It abounded,
                  also, with expressions of ardent love, hope, and thanksgiving that she had
                     discovered her uncle, and from him
                  had learned their place of residence.
               In the course of a fortnight an Indian messenger was sent to Boston, to whom Mr.
                  Eaton committed a package of letters, amongst which was Priscilla's.
               No one thing made Priscilla so sensible that she was in a new world, as the dusky
                  forms, the uncouth language, and the gay, fantastic drapery of the, wild sons of
                  the forest. Indians, both male and female, frequently came to the settlement to
                  beg and to barter.
               One day they were visited by a distinguished chief from great distance. They could
                  neither learn the name of his tribe, his place of residence, nor the object of his
                  visit, because of their ignorance of his language—and they could obtain no
                  interpreter. The most that they could make out was, that his name was Omao. As
                  wise policy dictated, they treated him with courtesy and kindness, but in the
                  exuberance of their hospitality they treated him too frequently to potations of
                     aqua vitæ as they strangely miscalled
                  spirits, until he became partially intoxicated. When he arose to leave them, he
                  found that it was with difficulty that be could keep his feet. staggered gered
                  from side to side like a man attempting to walk the deck of a vessel in a storm at
                  sea. He knew that something strange had happened to him, but what it was he did
                  not understand. But when he saw the men laughing at his unsuccessful attempts to
                  maintain an upright position, his anger was aroused; he suspected that they had
                  been playing some trick upon him, and he was determined to be revenged. Taking an
                  arrow from the quiver which hung over his shoulder, he balanced himself as well as
                  he could, and fired, as he thought, directly into the midst of them; but his arrow
                  went far above their heads, as though he had aimed at a bird in the air. This
                  increased their mirthfulness and his rage; he made various violent, angry
                  gesticulations, and then turned and staggered away.
               Priscilla, who had witnessed all this from the window of her uncle's house, saw
                  the Indian approaching. Her benevolent feelings were aroused. She thought he had
                  not been treated properly, and if he were to wander away in this half-intoxicated
                  condition, he might fall from some precipice, or into some pond or river, and be
                  lost. "I will endeavor to take care of him," said she to herself, "until the
                  effects of the liquor have passed off." She stepped from the door, extended towards Omao her
                  hand, and beckoned him to go into the shed which adjoined the house. The first
                  impulse of the chief was to slay her, as his failure to injure any of the men had
                  only increased their laughter. But perceiving every thing—rocks, trees, and
                  hills—to be apparently moving around him, and the ground heaving beneath his feet
                  as though it were tossed by an earthquake, he changed his purpose. Following her
                  into the shed to which she invited him, he sat down upon a block of wood until
                  Priscilla bad spread out one or two old skins for him. By this time he found it
                  difficult to maintain even an upright sitting posture. She pointed to the rude bed
                  she had prepared for him, and left him. In a few moments he managed to get from
                  the block on which he had been resting, to the spread skins. On these he cast
                  himself, and was soon lost in a profound drunken sleep.
               By the next morning be was tolerably well recovered. When the men came to see him,
                  he treated them with rudeness. He manifested a desire to have nothing to do with
                  them; so they soon left him, and went to their work. Priscilla brought him out a
                  plate of bread and meat and a pitcher of water, upon which he made a hearty
                  breakfast. When he arose to go, he took from his neck a string of ornaments,
                  consisting of wampum, made of small pieces of shell, to which was attached the
                  rude representation of a frog, and a small skin purse, and gave them to Priscilla
                  as an expression of his thanks for her kind treatment of him. Soon after this, he
                  left the settlement, and was seen there no more. The present which he gave
                  Priscilla made considerable sport among her friends.
               "Laugh as you may," said she, "it shows that these people, whom you call savages,
                  are not destitute of all sensibility. Although this is worthless to me, he may
                  have deemed it of great value. I, therefore, ought to prize it according to his
                  estimate, and not yours."
               "You are right," said her uncle. "This was evidently his mystery, or medicine bag,
                  which he carried with him as a charm to ward off all dangers. He doubtless gave it
                  to you as the most valuable thing in his possession."
               "What does it contain?"
               Mr. Eaton opened the little skin pouch, and emptied its contents on the table.
                  They consisted of the dried leg of a frog, two or three dried lizards, a tooth,
                  and the fragments of a beetle.
               "Superstition," said one.
               
               "I would not keep the repulsive thing," said another.
               "It may entail upon us all kinds of evils," said a third.
               "I do not think so," said Priscilla; "if his belief in its virtues was
                  superstitious, I should think that your belief in its ability to bring evils was
                  equally so. For my part, I look upon it not as a very desirable present, but
                  certainly as a harmless one, and I shall keep it both as a curiosity and as a
                  token of his gratitude. Besides, there may be a providence in it. We ought to
                  conciliate these rude creatures by kind and generous treatment. At any rate, I
                  shall keep this singular necklace, and if I ever see this Indian again, I will
                  show it to him, to let him know that I valued it."
               After all had examined it, Priscilla rolled it in a piece of paper, and put it in
                  the pocket of her dress. She had a vague impression that, possibly at some future
                  time, it might be of service to her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               AN AWAKENING CONVERSATION.
               DURING the time that Priscilla was at New Haven, she endeavored to make herself
                  useful by the use of her needle, and by rendering any assistance to the family in
                  her power. She was also a frequent visitor to the sick, by whom she was always
                  received with pleasure. Her benevolent smile, her pleasant tones of voice, her
                  timely inquiries and suggestions, and her delicate attentions to their physical
                  comfort, rendered her visits agreeable and useful.
               Next to her uncle, no one felt so deep an interest in Priscilla as the good
                  pastor. He was a careful observer of all her ways, and whilst he saw nothing in
                  her conduct to which he could take exceptions, he at the same time feared that
                  something might be wanting.
               "Why is it," said he to himself, "that she never comes to see me now? And, when I
                  call at her uncle's, she is always so busy that she cannot spare time for
                  conversation. I fear she is not in a state of grace, and for that reason avoids me. I have, then, a duty to perform.
                  I must learn her condition, and counsel her accordingly."
               Priscilla, like unconverted persons generally, felt embarrassed in the presence of
                  a minister. She feared that he would converse with her personally upon religion,
                  and this she did not desire. She knew she was not a Christian, and was, therefore,
                  liable to reproofs and warnings whenever an opportunity for them was offered, She
                  determined that these opportunities should occur but seldom.
               The pastor, therefore, suspected the true reason of her inaccessibleness.
               There may be great natural amiableness and benevolence of disposition, with a
                  strong aversion to true godliness. The may be decided preferences for certain
                  forms of worship, and for doctrinal creeds, and an absence of the spirit of
                  devotion. Priscilla cherished an outward regard for religion. She was always
                  present at meeting on the Sabbath, and at family prayers. She was, as we have
                  seen, decidedly opposed to prelacy, and favorable to Puritanism. This was the
                  effect of early parental influence, and of subsequent experience. How could she
                  love a religion, the adherents of which had subjected her and her parents to so
                  much suffering, because of their differences of opinion? And yet she made no
                  pretensions to experimental piety. She had been accustomed every night to say the
                  prayers her mother taught her, yet she had never sincerely and heartily prayed.
                  Her external deportment was in all respects exemplary, but her heart was at enmity
                  with God.
               As Mr. Davenport found it difficult to obtain an interview with her, because she
                  exhibited so much adroitness in shunning him, he finally sent word that he wished
                  to see her at his house.
               I wonder what he wants," said Priscilla to herself. "I hope he is not going to
                  urge religion upon me."
               Accustomed as she was to yield a cheerful compliance with the wishes of others,
                  she could not decline the request of so important a personage as the minister. She
                  therefore went to see him.
               She was received with what appeared to her formal cordiality. The good pastor
                  appeared as if he had some official business to transact with her, and was at a
                  loss how to give it an easy introduction. However, after a number of general
                  inquiries and unimportant remarks, he enquired,—
               
               "Miss Eaton, are you a member of the church?"
               "I am not, sir."
               Sorry am I to hear that. And have you never given your heart to God?"
               It is coming now, thought Priscilla. I wish uncle would send for me. O, how
                  irksome to hear religious talk! She was silent.
               "Have you never felt conviction for sin?"
               "I know I'm a sinner."
               "That may be, and yet you may have had no genuine conviction."
               "I have always done what I thought was right."
               She had scarcely uttered this, before the query rose in her mind, "Was it right
                  for me to practise deception, in order to cross the Atlantic?" and she felt
                  condemned for the remark.
               "You may, perhaps, think so but if you were carefully to examine your past life,
                  and the motives of your conduct, you would discover many things which were not
                  right, and which you never thought was right. Your heart is like a cage of unclean
                  birds; it is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. The word of God
                  declares that the imaginations of the thoughts of the heart are evil only, and
                  that continually, and that it is fully set in men to do evil; and what evidence is
                  there that yours is an exception? Why, my young friend, the mere fact that you
                  have lived so long without placing your affections upon things above, furnishes
                  abundant evidence that your heart is most deeply depraved.
               "For a moment dwell upon it. Although God is the most holy, benevolent, and
                  gracious being, yet you do not love him. Although he is the most powerful being,
                  and has all things under his control; though he is the almighty God, who drowned
                  the old world with the waters of the deluge; consumed Sodom and Gomorrah with fire
                  sent down from heaven, and overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, so that
                  they sunk like lead in the mighty waters, yet you do not fear him. Though he is
                  the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; though from him have come all
                  the blessings of your past life, yet you have never rendered him a tribute of
                  sincere gratitude. How unfeeling, how worldly, how thoughtless, how selfish your
                  heart must be!"
               To all this Priscilla impatiently listened, but made no reply. No tears were
                  streaming from her eyes, no penitential sorrow was awakened in her breast. She
                  felt indignant rather than contrite. She did not believe that this was her character, though she could not
                  prove the contrary.
               "My duty requires me to say, Miss Eaton," continued the stern pastor, "that you
                  are a transgressor of the infinite law of God. Because of your transgressions you
                  are exposed to the infinite penalty of that law. You are now under condemnation,
                  as the culprit is under condemnation after his crime is detected, and he has been
                  sentenced to die. My friend, the wrath of God abideth upon you; the wrath of God
                  abideth upon you, and, except you repent, you must forever perish." This was said
                  in so solemn and impressive a manner, that Priscilla quailed before him, and
                  trembled, as if in sympathy with the leaves quivering upon the trees at the
                  door.
               The conversation was now interrupted by one of the men coming in with a request to
                  the pastor to meet with several others, and assist in deciding upon the location
                  of the meeting house.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               AN INQUIRER.
               PRISCILLA returned home, but with very different emotions from those with which
                  she left it. An important truth had been fixed in her conscience, which rankled
                  there like a barbed arrow. "The wrath of God abideth upon me! the wrath of God
                  abideth upon me!" was constantly sounding in her ears, or falling in whispers from
                  her lips. She looked over her past life; it seemed to her all defiled with sin.
                  She could think upon no act which she had ever performed without perceiving its
                  defects. Selfishness appeared to her the predominant element of her character. She
                  had never done any thing with a view to glorify God. She acknowledged the truth of
                  the accusation that she had never offered to God her thanksgiving for his past
                  mercies, and especially for his great goodness in bringing her safely across the
                  dangerous deep, and guiding her to the residence of her uncle, and to the
                  knowledge of her parents' home. She felt deeply her sinfulness, and the justice of her condemnation. "O, how
                  ungrateful, how wicked I have been! If I should be forever banished from my
                  heavenly Father's presence, it would be no more than I deserve. Against thee, and
                  thee only, have I sinned, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and
                  be clear when thou judgest. What must I do to be saved?"
               For several days she was in a state of great dejection, frequently uttering, "God
                  be merciful to me, a sinner!"
               O, how she longed for her uncle to speak to her upon the important subject which
                  now entirely engrossed her mind! But he was so exclusively absorbed in the affairs
                  of the infant colony that he did not notice the change in her appearance, nor
                  address to her any remarks that were adapted to afford her relief.
               Her desire was gratified from another source.
               "What is the matter, Priscilla?" asked Mrs. Mitchel. "I have noticed that for
                  several days you have been 
                     ususually
                     unusually
                   pensive. I hope no new affliction has befallen you."
               A flood of tears and a convulsive grasp of her friend's hand were her answer.
                  After recovering from her first gush of feeling, she mournfully said,—
               "Every heart knoweth its own bitterness."
               "Very true, Priscilla; and if yours is of a nature proper to be confided to a
                  friend, tell me, and I will sympathize with you with all the tenderness of a
                  sister."
               "O Mrs. Mitchel, I'm a sinner!" said she, with the tears streaming down her
                  cheeks. "I'm a great sinner; and I fear I shall be lost forever."
               "I bless the Lord that you are sensible of it, Priscilla. It is a great thing to
                  be brought under concernment for our sins. We are all of us guilty, but all do not
                  feel it. Relate to me how you discovered your sinful state, and what have been
                  your feelings since."
               In compliance with her request, Priscilla gave an account of her interview with
                  Mr. Davenport, what he said, and how she had been affected since. She told her
                  experience, and then asked, "What shall I do?"
               "I think, my child, you had better go and see the good pastor again; he is the
                  best able to give you that instruction which you at present need. I will most
                  cheerfully accompany you."
               The masculine sternness of the Puritan divine was not particularly attractive to
                  Priscilla, and she hesitated; but after considerable urging, she complied.
               
               So soon as the minister was in possession of her feelings, he told her that,
                  however deep her convictions of sin were, she still came far short of a full
                  realization of her guilt. "In order to form a complete estimate of the demerit of
                  sin, we must be able to comprehend fully the immaculate holiness and the vast
                  extent of the divine law. To do this, we must be able to form adequate conceptions
                  of the greatness of its Author. But God is incomprehensible. How strong and bold
                  is the language of Job! 'Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out
                  the Almighty to perfection? 'Tis high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than
                  hell; what canst thou know? the measure thereof is longer than the earth, and
                  broader than the sea.' As now you cannot comprehend the greatness of God, neither
                  can you comprehend the greatness of his law. It is exceeding broad; it embraceth
                  all worlds, and taketh cognizance of the thoughts, the purposes, and the
                  motives—yea, of all the workings of the inmost soul of every rational creature.
                  And as you cannot form full conceptions of the law, you cannot, of course, form
                  adequate conceptions of the vileness of sin, which is its violation. You are
                  therefore far more guilty than you imagine or feel yourself to be. If your sins
                  were set in order before you, as they are before the eye of Him against whom they
                  have been directed, if they appeared to you as vile as they do to Him, you would
                  be overwhelmed with despair."
               This train of remark was not indulged in without design. The pastor was aiming to
                  accomplish a specific object, for which these thoughts were specially adapted. In
                  his view, it was important that a decided, genuine conversion should be preceded
                  by a deep preparatory "law work"—a keen sense of personal guilt and just
                  condemnation. Instead, therefore, of endeavoring to impart immediate comfort, he
                  labored rather to give intensity to her convictions; to make her sensible of her
                  utter sinfulness and hopelessness; to cut her off entirely from the least
                  dependence upon herself, in consequence of any natural goodness which she might
                  suppose she possessed, and convince her that she was entirely at the disposal of
                  that just and infinite Being whose law she had violated, and whose anger she had
                  incurred.
               "What now can you do?" continued the faithful pastor. "God gave you a law which
                  was a perfect transcript of his own character, 'holy, just, and good;' to this law
                  he annexed the penalty of eternal
                  death, endless banishment from his presence into outer darkness and sorrow. As now
                  you have violated this law so frequently that you can give an affirmative answer
                  to the question of Eliphaz the Temanite to Job, when he asked, 'Is not thy
                  wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?' and as Jehovah, whom you have
                  offended, is a God of righteousness and truth, and hateth iniquity with a perfect
                  hatred,—what hope have you of escape? Your condemnation by the law is just; this
                  you say you feel."
               "I do."
               "Well, then, as God is just, and, therefore, is disposed to execute justice, how
                  can you escape without justice being set at nought—disregarded—treated as of no
                  account?"
               "It is that which troubles me. I know that I'm justly condemned, and I can see no
                  way in which a just God can save me. All is dark."
               "Has your present anxiety been produced in any way by any special sin, or by the
                  neglect of some known positive duty?"
               "Not that I am sensible of. My whole life appears sinful. I have never loved God.
                  I have never designedly tried to please him. I have seldom thought of him. I have
                  always been seeking my own ways."
               "The reason I ask the question is, because the accusations of natural conscience
                  are sometimes mistaken for the convictions of the Spirit. A person who has
                  committed some particular sin, of more than usual criminality, may possess a deep
                  sense of his guiltiness, and be overwhelmed with sorrow, without being in any
                  degree under the special influences of the Holy Ghost. The anguish of Judas
                  Iscariot can be accounted for without any reference to the convicting power of the
                  Spirit."
               "My sorrow," said Priscilla, "does not arise from any one sin which I have
                  committed, nor from any recent acts of transgression. It was occasioned by your
                  last conversation. That passage of Scripture which you used—'the wrath of God
                  abideth upon you'—has been continually following me, and sounding in my ears like
                  a death knell."
               "It is your death knell," replied the minister, in slow, measured, and solemn
                  tones, which made his inquirer tremble; "and if you repent not, it will be your
                  bitter experience during the endless ages of eternity. You are standing on
                  slippery places, and the flames of hell wait to receive you. If you were to die in
                  your present condition, you would, like the rich man, lift up your eyes, being in
                  torments. There is nothing before you
                  but a fearful looking for of judgment, and of fiery indignation, which shall
                  devour the adversaries; and were you to be forever banished into outer darkness,
                  where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, your own conscience,
                  and all the angels of heaven would approve your sentence. Your condition is a
                  fearful one. You have no time to lose. What you intend to do to secure the
                  salvation of your soul, you must do quickly. Time flies; death hastens, and hell
                  opens wide its mouth to receive you."
               The poor girl obtained no comfort from this interview. She returned home more
                  unhappy than ever. It seemed to her as if the minister was unnecessarily stern,
                  harsh, and even cruel.
               "I thought," said she, "that he would pour balm on my bleeding heart; but instead
                  of that, he has probed my wounds, opened them deeper, and made them more painful.
                  My condition seems more hopeless than ever. Instead of addressing to me a single
                  promise, he has dwelt altogether on the terrors of the Lord."
               "Be not grieved, Priscilla, with his treatment; he has had much experience, and
                  knows how to deal skilfully with inquiring souls. All that he said was true,"
                  replied her aunt.
               Although the minister was apparently harsh in his language, yet his soul was full
                  of tenderness for her. He had indulged in this strain of solemn and awakening
                  truth from a sense of pastoral fidelity, and because he desired that the spiritual
                  work in progress within her might be radical and thorough. But after she had
                  retired, he knelt upon the floor of his hut, and poured out a most earnest and
                  affectionate prayer in her behalf, pleading with deep feeling and pathos, as a man
                  pleadeth with his friend, that the good work which he believed had been begun
                  within her might be carried on, to perfect completion, that after having clear
                  views of her great sinfulness and entire helplessness, she might be made willing,
                  in the day of his power, to submit herself unconditionally to the divine disposal,
                  and might thus find peace.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               ENLIGHTENING THE INQUIRER.
               THE conversation resulted in imparting to Priscilla more intelligent and enlarged
                  views of her sinfulness. She thought more of the greatness of God; of her relation
                  to him as a subject; of the holiness and strictness of the law which she had
                  violated; of the moral necessity there was for the execution of the penalty. She
                  looked at herself as a member of the vast universe. She thought upon the relation
                  which her sins sustained to other members of the great family of God, and wondered
                  what the effect upon them would be, if her sins were to escape the threatened
                  penalty. It seemed to her that whatever course God pursued in the treatment of any
                  of his creatures, it must be such as to secure the approbation and the admiration
                  of all holy beings. Then the question came to her, "How would my deliverance from
                  deserved punishment be regarded by holy beings? Could they approve it? I know they
                  would approve my condemnation; how, then, could they approve my salvation?"
               Of one thing she felt convinced, and that was, that God could not treat her as if
                  she were isolated from the rest of the universe, but that he must have regard to
                  his own honor and glory among them; and as she could see no way in which he could
                  forgive and save her, consistently with his own glory, she felt as if there were
                  no hope for her. "O that I could see my mother, and relate to her my feelings! Her
                  conversation and prayers might, perhaps, bring relief."
               She wandered around like a half-distracted person for a number of days. When she
                  read the Bible; it seemed to be filled with threatenings against her. She had
                  frequently heard her religious friends tell how some unexpected passage of
                  Scripture, to which they had undesignedly opened, had suddenly illumined their
                  minds and comforted their hearts, in times of perplexity and trouble. "Perhaps it
                  will be so with me," said she to herself; "there will be no harm in trying; I
                  will, therefore, open the Bible, and read the first passage that presents itself,
                  and will regard it as addressed personally to me. If it should be a promise, I
                  will receive it as a good omen." She sat down upon a moss-covered covered rock, under the shadow of a large and
                  beautiful elm, and took from her bosom a small Bible, which she carried constantly
                  with her. She held it closed in her hands a few moments, and then slowly opened
                  it. At the same instant, a small fleck of light fell through the leaves of the
                  trees, upon about the middle of the left page of her book. "Light!" said she to
                  herself; "just what I want. I will read the verse which it fell upon, and perhaps
                  it will enlighten and comfort my mind."
               The verse happened to be Psalm ix. 17. She read it aloud. "The wicked shall be
                  turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God." She closed the book, and
                  burst into tears.
               "No comfort, no hope for me; all is darkness and condemnation. What must I do to
                  be saved? O God, teach me how to escape from the wrath to come."
               Her meditations were interrupted by the approach of one of the men. At first she
                  knew not who it was; but as he came nearer, and more of his form could be seen
                  amid the trees of the wood, Priscilla was glad to discover that it was the pastor.
                  She arose from her moss-covered seat, and went a few steps towards him. As Mr.
                  Davenport was on his way to the village, Priscilla accompanied him. After the
                  usual salutations of the day were over, the good minister inquired how her soul
                  prospered. Priscilla related to him fully her various exercises of mind—her inner
                  life, her increased sense of guilt, and her clearer perceptions of the justness of
                  her condemnation, since her last interview with him.
               "And I can see no gleam of hope, no way of escape. God has said the wicked shall
                  be turned into hell: if, now, he is a God of truth, how can I escape, without his
                  violating his own word?"
               "That, my young friend, is truly the great question. The divine Lawgiver says,
                  'The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The wages of sin is death. The wicked shall
                  not go unpunished.' His own justice and veracity are pledged for its execution. By
                  violating that law, you are exposed to its dreadful penalty; it is, therefore, an
                  important question in what way, or on what principle, you can escape, consistently
                  with divine justice. How can God be true to himself, and yet deliver you from the
                  punishment with which he has threatened you?"
               It is that which troubles me. I know that Jesus came into the world as our
                  Saviour; I know I must believe in him; yet every thing seems so vague, so indefinite and difficult, that I
                  understand nothing."
               After a somewhat close examination of his inquirer, the pastor was convinced that
                  what he termed a "good law work" had been performed within her; that she had
                  clear, deep, and intelligent convictions of her true character and condition
                  before God, and that, therefore, it would be appropriate to unfold to her the
                  provisions of the gospel, and explain to her on what principles God could be just,
                  and yet pardon a justly condemned sinner. This important duty he endeavored to
                  perform whilst returning slowly with her to the settlement. He told her, among
                  many other things, that all our knowledge of the way of salvation was derived
                  entirely from the Bible. Nowhere else, but from the law and the testimony, could
                  we obtain any authoritative, satisfactory information upon this, all-absorbing
                  theme. The main question, therefore, was, What do the Scriptures teach upon this
                  subject? Ascertain that, and we have learned all that it is necessary for us to
                  know.
               "One thing," continued he, "is very evident; and that is, that it is far beyond
                  the ability of man to deliver himself from the condemned and wretched state in
                  which his sins have plunged him. Unless aid from a higher source is extended to
                  him, his condition is utterly hopeless. This aid has been provided; for we read
                  that "He hath laid help upon one who is mighty;" and who can this mighty one be,
                  but the Lord Messiah, to whom Isaiah refers, as the one who "speaks in
                  righteousness, mighty to save."
               "I believe all that, and yet I do not see how the divine justice is guarded, or
                  the honor of God preserved, in the forgiveness of one who is justly condemned. If
                  you could explain this, you would relieve me of my chief difficulty."
               "The reason why you do not see how the divine justice is protected, is because you
                  fail of appreciating the grand principle of substitution, which is a prominent
                  element in the government of God. Let me read to you a few verses upon this
                  subject. Taking the little Bible from her hand, he paused for a few moments in his
                  walk, and read as follows: 'I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
                  received, how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures.' 'We see
                  Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death,
                  crowned with glory and honor; that he,
                  by the grace of God, should taste death for every man.' 'In whom we have
                  redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of
                  his grace.' "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
                  iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we
                  are healed.' 'The blood of Christ cleanseth us from all sin.' 'He is the
                  propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the
                  whole world.' 'The good Shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.' From these and
                  many other passages of like import, it is evident that Christ, the Son of God,
                  came into the world, assumed human nature, lived a holy life, so as to fulfil and
                  thereby approve the law, and then voluntarily died in the stead of and for the
                  benefit of the human family. He came to make propitiation for them, by offering
                  himself a sacrifice in their behalf. And God is willing to accept of this
                  sacrifice as a substitute for the execution of the penalty upon the sinner,
                  provided the sinner will believe in Christ. As, now, Jesus Christ is a being of
                  such an exalted and divine nature, as he was perfectly holy, the substitution of
                  his death in the place of the execution of the real penalty upon the actual
                  transgressor was a clear and very strong expression of God's abhorrence of sin. It
                  also developed his determination to maintain the authority of his own law."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               GREAT CHANGE.
               A SHORT distance before these two interlocutors, and directly in their path, upon
                  a large, flat rock, which was level with the surface of the ground, lay a
                  repulsive serpent, coiled up, either asleep or else warming himself in the rays of
                  the sun. So closely engaged were Priscilla and the pastor in conversation that
                  they did not perceive him until they were nearly upon him. But so soon as it was
                  discovered, the pastor raised his cane, and, with one blow, disabled it, so that
                  it could not "drag its slow length along." He then stamped upon its head with the
                  thick heel of his boot, and killed it.
               "A very timely providence," said he. "It reminds us of the first promise given to
                  man, after the introduction of sin into the world, which was, that the seed of the
                  woman should bruise the head of the serpent; by which I understand that the
                  promised Messiah would, destroy the works and the power of the devil."
               Leaving the dead reptile, they passed on. "It is a mysterious arrangement,"
                  continued the minister, "in the plan of salvation, that the Son of God, 'through
                  death, was to destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.'"
               "But is there not," inquired, Priscilla, anxious to resume the conversation where
                  it was broken off, by the incident which we have just related,—"is there not
                  something extremely cruel in obliging an innocent person to suffer instead of the
                  guilty?"
               "There is; but that question is not appropriate to this subject. For God did not
                     oblige his Son to suffer in man's stead. It was entirely voluntary
                  on the part of Christ. He entered cheerfully upon this work; as it was written of
                  him, 'I delight to do thy will, O God.' It was an arrangement into which he
                  cordially entered, out of regard to his great love for the ruined children of men.
                  This feature relieves, it entirely from all cruelty or injustice. If Christ had
                  been arbitrarily compelled to suffer and die, against his own will, the whole
                  subject of redemption would assume a very different character from what now
                  belongs to it."
               But if, as one of the passages which you read says, 'Christ tasted death for every man,' why is not every man
                  saved?"
               Because the benefits of Christ's death to man are made to depend upon the exercise
                  of faith; for Paul says, 'God hath set forth Christ Jesus to be a propitiation
                  through faith in his blood,' 'that he might be just, and the
                  justifier of him which believeth.' In another place he says, 'Being
                  justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
                  Christ.' And Christ himself said, 'He that believeth and is baptized shall be
                  saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned.' So that, although he has made
                  ample provision for the salvation of all men by his own atoning death, yet saving
                  benefits from this provision will be received by those only who exercise penitence
                  for their sins, and faith in him. Permit me now, before I part from you,"
                  continued the pastor, as they approached within sight of the humble dwellings of
                  the colonists, "to be more personal, and to make an application of these truths to
                  your own case, for I have felt a tender and paternal interest in you, and should
                  rejoice if, in the providence of God, you should become my first convert in this
                  wilderness of the new world. You are a justly condemned sinner. You are under,
                  that is, exposed to, the penalty of the law, which is eternal death. But Jesus
                  Christ, the Son of God, has entered the world, and died upon the cross, for you.
                  He has made propitiation for your sins. He has met the demands of the law against
                  you so far, that if you will now abandon your sins, accept of Christ as your
                  Saviour, and sincerely devote yourself to his cause, you will be forgiven and
                  saved. God will be as truly honored by your salvation, through faith in Christ, as
                  he will be in your condemnation if you reject Christ. Divine justice will be as
                  really regarded and maintained by your forgiveness through the atoning death of
                  Christ, as it would have been by the execution of the penalty upon you if Christ
                  had not died in your behalf. All that is wanting is, that you should feel, as I
                  believe you do, a deep sense of guilt; that you should justify both the law and
                  its divine Lawgiver by acknowledging the justice of your condemnation; that you
                  should possess a truly penitent and contrite heart, and that you should make an
                  entire and unreserved surrender of yourself to Christ, relying wholly upon his
                  atoning death for your acceptance with God. Do this, and your anxieties will
                  disappear, your burden will be removed, and you will be filled, with 'joy
                  unspeakable and full of glory.'"
               
               They now reached the village. Priscilla's uncle came out to meet them, and, with a
                  smile on his countenance, told her he expected that, by to-morrow night, the
                  messenger would return, bringing letters from her father, or, perhaps, her father
                  himself.
               "I think it most likely that he will come himself," replied Priscilla.
               "I hope so," added the pastor, "for I should rejoice to hear how Zion prospers
                  among our friends there."
               That night Priscilla scarcely closed her eyes. Her religious exercises, her
                  conversation with the minister, and her earnest desire to see her father, served
                  to banish all tendency to sleep.
               She earnestly desired to obtain peace of mind before her father's arrival, because
                  she knew it would be to him such grateful news.
               From the Indians, who frequently visited New Haven, the settlers learned what
                  kinds of plants in their vicinity were used for food. It was the custom of
                  Priscilla to go out in the morning, gather a quantity of these, and then prepare
                  them for her uncle's table. They assisted in giving variety to the articles of
                  diet used by the family.
               On the morning after her conversation with Mr. Davenport, she took a basket and
                  went out, professedly for that purpose. She wore a light straw bonnet, and over
                  her neck was carelessly thrown a small brown handkerchief, or shawl. Her Bible was
                  in her bosom. Her real object was to seek some place of retirement in the depths
                  of the forest, where she could read and pray aloud without being overheard by
                  others—where she could give free vent to her feelings without the least
                  embarrassment from the presence of others.
               Being absorbed with her own thoughts, she wandered away much farther than she was
                  aware of, until, at a point some three miles from the settlement, she found, on
                  the borders of a pond, a high, precipitous rock, at the base of which was a little
                  natural grove, so secluded and protected by thick shrubbery as effectually to
                  prevent any one who might be passing from seeing those who sought concealment
                  within its shadow.
               "This shall be my sanctuary," said Priscilla. "Here will I seek God with all my
                  heart."
               After hanging her bonnet upon the branches, she sat down, took the Bible from her
                  bosom, and read aloud, with frequent ejaculations of her own interspersed, the
                  fifty-first Psalm, the fifteenth chapter of Luke, and the fifty-third chapter of
                  Isaiah, as these had been particularly
                  recommended to her attention by the pastor. Whilst engaged in reading, she was
                  startled by a repulsive-looking snake, which slowly crawled by her. As she changed
                  her position, the reptile raised its head, and, with a hissing sound, thrust out
                  its forked tongue, and then slipped into the bushes. Priscilla soon recovered her
                  composure, and continued reading. Presently an large black spider darted from its
                  silken, funnel-shaped hole in the decayed stump of an old tree, and seized a fly.
                  The captive made considerable struggling, but, in a few moments, was mastered by
                  its deceitful enemy, and carried hopelessly to the bottom of the den.
               "If I were superstitious," said Priscilla, "I should regard these as bad omens,
                  and hastily return. And yet how suggestive were they! That old serpent, the devil,
                  goeth about like a lion, seeking whom he may devour. He leadeth the wicked captive
                  at his will. In his concealed snares he entraps unwary souls to their own ruin. O
                  God, break his power over me! Permit me to enjoy the liberty of thy children."
               She threw herself upon her knees on the grass, and, for a long-time, was engaged
                  in earnest, wrestling prayer. She not only confessed her great sinfulness in
                  general, but specified fied various particular offences, which, though she had not
                  been in the habit of regarding them as specially sinful, now lay with weight upon
                  her mind. She prayed for light, for peace, for pardon, for salvation.
               She justified God in her condemnation. "O Father, so numerous are my
                  transgressions, and so aggravated my guilt, that if thou wert to banish me forever
                  from all the joys of heaven, there would be no injustice in my doom. In my inmost
                  soul I feel that it would be all right. Unworthy am I of the smallest favor from
                  thy hand. Yet, Father, hast thou not promised to pardon the penitent? Hast thou
                  not sent Jesus, thy Son, to make propitiation? Has he not been slain as the
                  atoning Lamb? Did he not say that he came into the world to save sinners? O, for
                  his sake, have mercy upon me. I plead with thee by his tears, his groans, his
                  crown of thorns, and bloody sweat. I plead with thee by his cruel mockings,
                  scourging, and condemnation; by his wounded hands, his pierced side, his earnest
                  prayers, and his agonizing death, have compassion upon me, and cast me not away
                  from thy presence. O Lord, I believe in thee. I trust in the righteousness and
                  death of thy Son. I throw myself at thy feet. I would now—O help me to do it sincerely—I would now, most
                  merciful Saviour, cast myself, without reserve, into thine arms. I would now give
                  myself entirely to thee. From this hour, O blessed Saviour, I consecrate myself,
                  my time, my gifts, my influence, all that I have, and all that I am, entirely to
                  thee. I would be thine for time and thine for eternity. In thy death would I trust
                  for pardon, and thy character would I take for my example. O, lift upon me the
                  light of thy countenance, and cause old things to pass away, and all things to
                  become new."
               She paused. A glow of unusual peace passed over her mind, like sunshine passing
                  over, illuminating, and beautifying a landscape. As she opened her eyes, they fell
                  upon the silken trap of the spider. A trembling of the web indicated a struggle,
                  in the deceitful funnel, between the two insects; presently the fly came to the
                  edge of the nest, and flew away. "Good! the captive is delivered. Is it the emblem
                  of my deliverance? for I feel like a bird escaped from the snare of the fowler. My
                  burden is gone. My tears are dried up. I see now how it is: Believing in Christ,
                  trusting in Christ, how simple! how easy! I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is
                  mine. Why was it so dark before? But no matter; all is light now. Bless the Lord,
                  O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. I must hasten to my
                  faithful pastor, and tell him I have found the pearl of great price the one thing
                  needful. Henceforth I will serve the Lord."
               She took her bonnet from the bushes, put it on, seized her pail, and left her
                  leafy tabernacle to return to the settlement, singing as she went,— 
                     
                        "The Lord hath opened wide mine eyes
                        To look beyond the threatening skies;
                        The God-Man Saviour, now I see,
                        Did shed his crimson blood for me."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               THE MISSING GIRL.
               ABOUT an hour after Priscilla had left the house, in the morning, with her basket,
                  as narrated in the preceding chapter, the Indian messenger who had been sent to
                  Boston, and whom Priscilla's uncle told her he expected by night, returned. There
                  was something of a stir among the settlers when it was known that Priscilla's
                  father was with him. All sympathized in the joy of the occasion, for all of them
                  were anxious that the girl in whom they had become so deeply interested should
                  find her father and her home.
               "Where is my daughter?" said Mr. Abel Eaton, as, without ceremony, he entered the
                  house which had been pointed out to him as his brother's; "where is Priscilla, my
                  long-lost child? O, relieve my suspense, and bring me to her at once."
               "She is in the fields, gathering a few plants to boil with our dinner," replied a
                  woman who was at work in the kitchen.
               "In what direction? Tell me, and I will go to her at once."
               Presently the family and friends, who had heard of his arrival, assembled in the
                  house, and dissuaded him from going in pursuit of Priscilla, as it was very
                  uncertain where she was, and she would doubtless return in a short time.
               So, taking a seat in their midst, he endeavored to make the time appear to pass
                  rapidly, by giving some account of the state of things in Boston. Many questions
                  were asked and answered.
               "We are not, at present, sailing through the smoothest water there. The Familists
                  are coming in to destroy, like the locusts of Egypt, every green thing; and
                  heretics of other kinds, like the caterpillar and canker worm, are there to help
                  them. Our godly magistrates, however, are determined to deal towards them with an
                  iron rod."
               An hour passed away, and there were no signs of Priscilla's return. Her father
                  expressed some anxiety for her; but his fears were allayed when they told him that
                  she was accustomed to going off alone, and to take her own time to return, and
                  therefore he had no reason to be alarmed on account of her delay.
               
               Conversation was kept up, with unflagging interest until the hour of dinner.
               "Has not Priscilla returned yet?" said her father; "if she went to gather greens
                  for dinner, she certainly would have come home by this time, unless something
                  unusual had detained her. Has she ever remained away from her meals, when she has
                  gone out in this manner?"
               "No; she is always at the table," replied her uncle.
               "Then something has happened," said her father, with deep emotion, at the same
                  time rising from his seat; "I will not touch another mouthful till I know the
                  worst." Seizing his hat, he went to the door, and asked what direction she took.
                  Being informed where she was seen last, he, with several others, started off in
                  pursuit of her. They wandered all the afternoon, exploring every valley, and
                  ascending every hill from which they could take a wide survey of the surrounding
                  country, but without success. They called her name aloud many times, but no reply
                  was heard, save the echo of their own voices. As the shadows of the evening
                  approached, they returned, hoping that they should find her at home upon their
                  arrival. They were disappointed! No one had seen or heard from her since morning.
                  The news soon spread through all the little settlement that Priscilla was missing,
                  creating intense excitement. Various opinions were expressed respecting the cause
                  of her absence; but the general impression was, that she had gone too far from the
                  village, and was lost. Her father, poor man, was overwhelmed with distress, and
                  would not be comforted. They entreated him to eat, for they knew he must be faint.
                  But he declined. He regarded himself as bound by his previous declaration that he
                  would not eat again till he knew the worst. He said he would spend the night in
                  looking for her, and passionately entreated others to do the same. Several parties
                  were immediately formed, who took with them lighted torches, and went forth in
                  various directions. The whole night was spent in search. The country for miles
                  around was examined. Every where that the different parties went, they shouted
                  aloud her name. At one time, one of them thought he heard her reply; but upon
                  listening more carefully, it proved to be the growl of some wild animal. The
                  morning came: the exploring parties all met at Mr. Eaton's, but not one of them
                  could furnish a single gleam of hope.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE ANXIOUS SEARCH.
               DEEP gloom now settled upon all. They feared the worst, yet they could not
                  relinquish the idea of farther search.
               As it was known that the Indians were skilful in following the trail of their
                  enemies through the woods and fields, it was proposed that one of them be obtained
                  for this purpose. A messenger was despatched for a neighboring brave, the
                  translation of whose name was Lightfoot, and who could speak a little English.
                  Upon his arrival, the Indian was informed of their object, and was asked if he
                  would undertake the search. He signified his acquiescence, and then asked what the
                  girl had in her hand, and whether she wore any shows, and if so, what size? All
                  the facts were communicated to him—that she went to get some young plants for the
                  table, that she had a basket, and that she wore shoes of the size of a pair of
                  hers which were shown him. He then inquired where she was last seen. Being
                  informed formed that the last time any of the family saw her, she was upon a
                  little rising piece of land, north of the house, and that they supposed she went
                  in that direction, he said he was ready to start.
               "Before setting out, let us," said Priscilla's uncle, "implore the blessing of
                  God. He has commanded us to acknowledge him in all our ways, and he would direct
                  our paths. We need his direction now, if ever; and let us seek it."
               A long and earnest prayer was offered for success to crown their efforts—that
                  father and child, after so long a separation, might be permitted once more to meet
                  and rejoice together.
               The two Eatons, with one or two others, carrying food, started off—the Indian, as
                  guide, taking the lead. They soon reached the top of the little rising knoll where
                  Priscilla was last seen. Lightfoot here requested his companions to stand still
                  for a few moments. He carefully examined the grass, and then, beckoning them to
                  follow, started towards a forest. In some places the grass was quite high. Here
                  the guide had no difficulty in tracking her. The leaning spears were like so many
                  indexes, pointing out the course she
                  had taken. In other spots the grass was low and thin. Here more caution was
                  required. Lightfoot generally crossed directly over these thin spots, in a
                  straight line with the course he had come, and after a little examination, would
                  find, without much difficulty, the trail in the higher, grass beyond. At one time,
                  before, reaching the woods, he lost her trail entirely. Beckoning to his followers
                  to stand still, so that be might not become confused with their footprints, he
                  carefully examined the ground in every direction for some distance. After a few
                  minutes, he told them to follow on.
               "I wonder," said Mr. Samuel Eaton, "how these savages are able to track a person
                  with so much certainty; for instance, how did he now find her lost trail?"
               "Suppose you ask him. Perhaps he is not so taciturn but that he will give you a
                  reply."
               "Lightfoot, how do you know you are on the right track?"
               The Indian stopped, and then turned back to the spot where he was when he told
                  them to "come on."
               "You see dat?" said he, pointing to the ground.
               "I see nothing unusual," was Mr. Eaton's reply. The little party all gathered
                  round, and looked, but said they saw no footprints.
               "No, no footprint; but what dis?" said the Indian, as he pushed away the thin
                  grass, and showed a plant which had been fresh cut. They all looked at the cut
                  plant.
               "You tell she had basket; me say she had knife, too. She stop here and cut
                  greens."
               "That seems very reasonable." The lower radicle leaves of the plant were left,
                  which showed it to be a species which they used for food.
               "Now look here. See dese little flowers all lean in dis way—de same dare—and
                  dare," pointing to other spots about a foot or so apart. "Dem where her feet
                  were—her trail. She went in dis 'rection," continued the Indian, pointing
                  obliquely towards the woods.
               "He's right," said Mr. Eaton; "I see it all, now that he has explained it; but I
                  should not have discovered it myself."
               "Perhaps not; but this is a part of an Indian's education. He has frequent
                  occasion to track, in this manner, his enemies, and his experience makes him
                  skilful."
               Pressing on with as much speed as they could, without danger of losing the trail,
                     they came, after a while, to a
                  brook. Lightfoot scanned the opposite shore for a few moments, and then pointed to
                  an indentation in the soft soil, which he said was her footprint.
               "Perhaps some one else has gone this way," said her father.
               "Lem me see," replied the guide. He then took one of the shoes, which was shown
                  him at the house as hers, and which he had brought with him, and stepping across
                  the brook, he placed it carefully over the print.
               "See dare; nice fit," said Lightfoot. By a careful inspection, the party were
                  satisfied that the impression was made by a shoe of precisely the same size as the
                  one which the Indian had brought with him. They had no doubt of its being
                  Priscilla's.
               These discoveries increased the excitement of the pursuit, and their admiration at
                  the skill of the guide. At times he seemed to be endowed with some sense of which
                  his companions were destitute, for he would pass on without any hesitancy, where
                  they could not see the least indication of Priscilla or any one else having
                  preceded them. They expected, when they entered the woods, that the Indian would
                  be perplexed. But he was not. He proceeded very cautiously, and occasionally would
                  point out to them the marks by which he was guided.
               "Dat be her work," said he, as he pointed to a small twig which was hanging from
                  its parent branch by its thin bark.
               "Perhaps some animal has done it," said Mr. Eaton.
               "No, no," replied Lightfoot; "look; it be a sharp, clean cut through de leaf into
                  de stem."
               Upon a close inspection, he was found to be correct. The knife had cut through the
                  leaf, and nearly severed the stem from its branch. It was retained by the thin
                  fibres of the bark.
               "No animal do dat—woman swing her knife so," said he, at the same time imitating
                  her motion, "and cut de leaf."
               Keeping on her trail, they by and by came to a clear flowing spring. After a few
                  moments' examination, Lightfoot told them she had stopped there to rest.
               "How do you know that?" asked her father.
               "Look dare," replied he, pointing to a large stone; "she sat down on dat—see dese
                  two marks,"—he pointed to the impression made by two feet at the side of a
                  stone;—"she put her feet dare, and her basket dare,"—pointing to a spot where the
                  ground, being soft, had received the impression of a portion of the bottom of a
                  basket.
               
               "Nothing can be plainer," said her uncle.
               "Very true," replied his brother; "but it's strange that she should come here for
                  table plants, They do not grow in such shaded land."
               "Perhaps she rambled about from the novelty and pleasure of the thing."
               "No, no; there must have been some other motive," said her father.
               After refreshing themselves with a draught of clear and cool water from the
                  spring, they resumed their pursuit. By and by they approached a high, precipitous
                  rock. The trail led round the base of it to the opposite side from where they
                  were. It was upon the verge of a large pond. "Ugh!" uttered Lightfoot, indicating
                  that he discovered something more than the signs of a single trail. He put his
                  finger on his lips to indicate silence, and then cautiously and noiselessly
                  reconnoitred the spot. He found an opening into some bushes at the base of the
                  high rock, through which he entered. Again did he make a low, guttural "Ugh!" He
                  had found the very spot which Priscilla had chosen as her sanctuary! The marks of
                  the recent presence of some one were very apparent on the broken leaves and the
                  trampled grass.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE RESULT.
               LIGHTFOOT examined the ground very carefully with Indian sagacity, and then said,
                  "She be here some time. She do so here," at the same time throwing himself upon
                  his knees.
               "The posture of prayer," said Mr. Eaton.
               "Yes, she probably chose this as a suitable place for devotion; but where is she
                  now?" said her father. "O my God! am I to be disappointed again? Shall I never see
                  my daughter?" His anguish was great. He sat down in the same spot where Priscilla
                  had sat to read her Bible, and wept like a child.
               "Be not discouraged too soon," said his brother. "We have not lost her trail yet,
                  and may still succeed in finding her."
               "What is that?" asked one of the company, as he pointed at an object some distance
                  from them, near the water.
               "It appears something like a light-colored stone." As all eyes were directed
                  towards it, a sudden gust of wind blew,
                  and rolled it along the shore.
               "A basket!" "A basket!" exclaimed two or three voices simultaneously. They all
                  hastened to the spot, and found it was Priscilla's basket, with a few greens in
                  it. It was examined with painful interest.
               This discovery served to increase the apprehensions of the company. They all had
                  their fears, and yet were unwilling to express them.
               "O that I knew the worst," groaned the father. "I fear some evil thing has
                  happened to my child, and I shall never see her again."
               As that was the feeling of the whole party, no one made reply. They stood for some
                  moments without uttering a word. The silence was broken by the guide giving one of
                  his mysterious "Ugh's," at the same time pointing to an object floating upon the
                  water. It had no resemblance to a branch, or any thing else that belonged to the
                  neighborhood of the pond. It had a round appearance, like a small basket. The
                  guide threw off his skin robe and buskins, plunged in, swam to the object, and
                  brought it to the shore. To their amazement, it proved to be Priscilla's bonnet!
                  The father seized it like a man distracted. The tears fell in streams from his
                  eyes. "This is more than I can bear. O Priscilla! Priscilla! why hast thou left us
                  without once more beholding thy parents? O God! thou hast written me childless.
                  What shall I do? where shall I go?"—and he buried his face in his hands.
               Various opinions were now expressed by the party, with none of which were they
                  fully satisfied. One was, that perhaps she had waded into the pond to refresh
                  herself, and had suddenly come to deep water, and accidentally drowned. Another
                  was, that the trials through which she had passed, her anxieties of mind, and the
                  excitement of her feelings in the near prospect of meeting her father, had
                  dethroned reason, and under the influence of insanity, she had committed suicide.
                  A third opinion was, that she had been suddenly frightened by wild beasts, or by
                  Indians, and had immediately fled, leaving her things behind her, and had become
                  lost in the woods; whilst a fourth opinion, which, however, seemed the most
                  unlikely of all, was, that she had been seized and carried off by some of the
                  natives.
               Though the father was bowed down with grief, he was not unmanned; He looked in
                  every nook; he shouted aloud her name, and seemed unwilling to yield to the
                  opinion that he never should see her
                  again. "Is it certain," said he, "that she can be tracked no farther?"
               "Lightfoot," said his brother, "can you follow her trail any farther?"
               A slight smile came over the Indian's face, as he replied,—
               "Me can no more see trail in water than me can in air."
               "Very true. Water retains no impression; but are you sure that she went in the
                  water?"
               Lightfoot went back a few steps, and showed an impression of one foot with its
                  toes towards the pond, and so near that the next step must have been in the
                  water.
               "Me no doubt she went in here." There were other marks which his keen eyes saw,
                  but which he did not point out. He had his own opinions, too, concerning the fate
                  of the girl; but as they were not asked, he, with Indian taciturnity, kept them to
                  himself.
               After some further search, the afflicted company returned with heavy hearts to the
                  village, taking with them the basket and bonnet, as memorials of the fatal
                  tragedy.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               PARENTAL EXPERIENCE.
               IT being the general impression, after all the facts were heard, that she was in
                  the water, and probably not far from the shore, the men turned out the next day,
                  and dragged the pond in every direction, but without success. They were obliged to
                  give her up as lost.
               The disappointed father became now an object of general interest and sympathy. The
                  minister, Mr. Davenport, was especially concerned for him and informed him of
                  Priscilla's awakening and conviction, and of his belief that she had passed from
                  death unto life. The passengers too, who came over with her from England, related
                  all the circumstances connected with her passage, her amiable and benevolent
                  behavior, and the universal love which all cherished for her. He had many
                  questions to ask, which they cheerfully answered. But the more information he
                  obtained concerning her, the heavier appeared his trial.
               
               "To think that after a separation of years, without once hearing from her, or even
                  knowing she was alive; to receive in one letter a long account of her history, and
                  an earnest request to come and take her home; and then to get here on the very day
                  of her disappearance,—is almost too much to bear. But let me not complain; I know,
                  O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted
                  me."
               The whole colony were affected. Gloom settled upon all their features, and it was
                  with difficulty that they attended to their accustomed work.
               On the following Sabbath the pastor preached an appropriate and impressive
                  discourse, from Jeremiah xv. 9. "She hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down
                  while it was yet day."
               In a few days Priscilla's father returned to Boston, with the mournful
                  intelligence to his wife. During his absence, she had been busily engaged in
                  preparing a room and bed for Priscilla. She looked for her return as one of the
                  happiest events of her life. Her absence had been a constant source of affliction,
                  which had imbittered all enjoyments. The hope of her return filled her with
                  unspeakable gladness.
               "My cup of joy," said the excited mother, "will be full. I shall have nothing more
                  to ask. O, how good is God! My lamb is to be returned to my bosom; and it seems to
                  me as if I should never again permit her to leave my sight."
               When, therefore, the father returned, without the lamb, and communicated, the
                  mournful tidings to the joyous mother, the disappointment was so severe, the
                  transition of feeling was so sudden and great, as to be too much for her delicate
                  and nervous constitution. She gave one loud, piercing shriek, and fell insensible
                  into the arms of her husband!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THE ELOPEMENT.
               "I WONDER why Priscilla is so late this morning with breakfast," said Mrs.
                  Williamson to her husband, on the morning after the sailing of the Reindeer. "She
                  ought to have rung the second bell long ago, and I have not yet heard the
                  first."
               "Perhaps she has overslept her usual time," replied her husband.
               "If she has, she ought to be trounced for it; for she knew that I intended to go
                  out and make some early calls, and this delay will put me back all day." This was
                  uttered in a petulant tone, for Mrs. Williamson was angry.
               "Perhaps you had better see, wife. It was so late when I came home last night,
                  after the sailing of our ship, that I have slept myself longer than I ought. I
                  must hurry, or I shall be late to the store."
               Mrs. Williamson hastily made her toilet, and descended to the kitchen, all
                  prepared to pour out upon Priscilla a stream of burning vituperation peration.
                  When she reached the kitchen, and found every thing just as it was left in the
                  evening, her anger knew no bounds.
               "Well, this is fine! not even a fire kindled, when it is high time that breakfast
                  was all over. That lazy, obstinate little hussy shall pay for this."
               She stepped to the bottom of the stairs, and called in a loud, shrill tone of
                  voice, "Priscilla! Priscilla!" but there came back no reply.
               "Confound the little sluggard, I'll wake her with a cold bath," said the
                  passionate woman.
               Mrs. Williamson seized a pitcher of water, and with hurried steps ascended to
                  Priscilla's room, with the intention of throwing it in her face, as she lay
                  sleeping upon her pillow. "I'll let her know that she shan't impose upon me."
               And yet, with all this unnecessary excitement of bad feeling, there mingled
                  occasional thoughts of an opposite kind, like these: "Perhaps she is sick. She is
                  a good girl, after all. I'm afraid I have been too severe with her. Poor thing;
                  she is to be pitied; being torn away as she was from her parents, of whom she
                  seems always to be thinking."
               When Mrs. Williamson entered the chamber, and perceived that the bed had not been
                  disturbed, that Priscilla was not there, but that a number of her garments were scattered carelessly
                  about the room, as though she had left in haste, she was more surprised than ever.
                  She knew not what to think.
               She immediately called her husband, showed him the condition of the room, and
                  asked his opinion of such conduct.
               "It was a good home to the obstinate little Puritan, and I don't know why she
                  should want to leave us," said the woman. "It's too bad to be treated in this
                  manner, after all the care I have taken of her. I have treated her as though she
                  was my own daughter."
               Her husband did not contradict her, although he thought, if a daughter of his was
                  subjected to all that he knew Priscilla had experienced there, he would soon
                  change her situation.
               Stephen was now called, to tell if he knew any thing of Priscilla's movements. But
                  he knew nothing. Priscilla had made a confidant of no one.
               "We must make inquiries," said Mr. Williamson, "and if we cannot find her, she
                  must look out for herself. Her going away in this secret manner is her own act,
                  and for the consequences she will have no one to blame but herself."
               After an ill-prepared breakfast, eaten in a worse humor, all of the family
                  commenced their inquiries. But nothing could be heard of Priscilla. No one had
                  seen her—no one knew where she had gone.
               It was acknowledged that she had managed her elopement very adroitly, though some
                  surprise was expressed that she had not taken more of her clothing.
               In a few days the affair became an old story, and was nearly forgotten by all the
                  family except one—that was Stephen. He knew not why it was, but his thoughts were
                  almost constantly upon Priscilla. He called to recollection many instances of her
                  kindness to him, and many of the remarks which she made to him when they were
                  alone. No one missed her as much as he.
               "I wonder," thought he, "if she thinks of me as much as I do of her. I wonder if
                  she would like to see me, or if she will ever write to me. O that I knew where she
                  was gone! I would try to have an interview with her, if it was only for a
                  moment."
               For a number of weeks Stephen appeared unusually depressed. He frequently spoke of
                  Priscilla, but never in such a manner as to awaken in his parents' mind the
                  thought that he had for her any special regard.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               NEWS FROM AFAR.
               ABOUT six months after Priscilla's departure, as Mr. Williamson entered his house,
                  one day at noon, he astonished his wife by the sudden announcement, "Well, wife, I
                  have learned all about Priscilla. She's gone to America!"
               "Gone to America!" exclaimed the lady, in great surprise; "gone to America! How
                  did she get money to pay her passage?"
               "Perhaps she didn't pay," replied her husband, smiling.
               "The artful jade didn't adopt men's clothes, and work her passage, did she?" asked
                  the lady.
               "Not exactly. She smuggled herself aboard, and kept out of the way until the
                  vessel was so far off, that the captain thought it best not to return."
               "What a cunning trollop! What did she say when she was finally discovered?"
               Mr. Williamson related all the circumstances as they were communicated by the
                  captain of the Reindeer, who had just arrived, and who corroborated his statement
                  by the documents signed by the passengers.
               "The best joke of all," said the owner, "is, she said that she had lived with me
                  four years without pay, and she thinks that ought to be an offset for the price of
                  her passage."
               "That's a pretty character to give us," replied the indignant woman. "Who took her
                  in when her own parents had abandoned her? and who has supported her for the last
                  four years? Work without pay!" continued she, in a peculiarly sneering manner. "I
                  should like to know at what price she holds her services. But there, I'm glad
                  we've heard from her; and so long as she has run away, I am not sorry she is gone
                  where it is not likely she will ever return."
               The recent intelligence from Priscilla was the absorbing topic of the dinner
                  table. No one was more deeply interested than Stephen. He said little himself, but
                  eagerly listened to all the remarks which were made by others.
               He had now arrived at an age when it was desirable to commence acquiring a
                  knowledge of some kind of business. He was accordingly taken by his father into
                  his counting room. Mr. Williamson was concerned in a number of vessels, which trafficked to different parts of
                  the world; and the business was of such a nature as to give employment to a number
                  of clerks. It was not difficult, therefore, to find a berth for Stephen. He was
                  accordingly installed in a subordinate capacity. But he could not forget
                  Priscilla. He secretly resolved that if ever an opportunity occurred, he would go
                  to America and try to find her.
               It was not long before such an opportunity presented itself. The Reindeer was
                  going back there. Mr. Williamson, (ignorant of the feelings of his son towards
                  Priscilla,) believing that it would be to his own advantage, and at the same time
                  highly improving to Stephen, asked him how he should like to go out, as
                  supercargo, to America. No proposition could have been more agreeable to him.
                  Since he first heard the Reindeer was going there, he had been contriving some
                  measures to go with her. He replied to the question of his father, "I should like
                  to go very much, and if you have no objection, I should be pleased to remain in
                  America a short time, and see if I could not obtain a good situation."
               "No objection at all. If a favorable opening presents itself, I should be glad to
                  assist you in getting into business there. In the course of time, we might be able
                  to consign our goods to you, and get you to purchase merchandise for us as our
                  agent. Look around when you arrive there, and let me know minutely all the facts
                  concerning any prospects that open before you."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THE TWO SERMONS.
               FOR several months Stephen had been more than usually interested in the duties of
                  religion. Although many of the preachers in the established church, during the
                  administration of Laud, were very tame, both in respect to the matter and manner
                  of their sermons, yet there were some exceptions. Amongst these was the Rev. Mr.
                  Carter, a man who exemplified in his own life all the Christian virtues, and who,
                  as a minister, labored assiduously for the conversion of men from the error of
                  their ways to the wisdom of the just. In his sentiments he was highly evangelical,
                  and in his preaching plain, direct and pungent. Wherever he went he was always
                  listened to with interest by the religious portion of the congregation, but was
                  generally unpopular with worldly and formal professors, on account of his severe
                  rebukes and solemn admonitions.
               He supplied the pulpit one Sabbath in the church which Mr. Williamson's family
                  were accustomed to attend. His text in the morning was Gen. iv. 10—"What hast thou
                  done?" In answering this question, he showed the sinful, the condemned, and the
                  helpless condition of men. He portrayed vividly the great guilt and danger of
                  transgressors, and showed the utter hopelessness of their state, if left to
                  themselves. This was intended as introductory to the afternoon discourse, which
                  was from Acts ii. 37—"What shall we do?"—and in which he opened the plan of
                  salvation so plainly, that a person of the weakest comprehension might have
                  understood it. He illustrated in a clear and forcible manner, now that
                  propitiation had been effected between God and men by the atoning sacrifice of
                  Christ, that all that was wanting on the part of the transgressor was repentance
                  of sin and faith in the Lord Jesus. "This do, and thou shalt live."
               Mrs. Williamson was not at all interested. She said she thought he would make a
                  good ranting Methodist. Her husband imagined that he discovered in him strong
                  tendencies to Puritanism. But on Stephen the effect was widely different. He said
                  but little, for he knew that he should meet with no sympathy at home. The two
                  texts were much in his thoughts; and he felt that the description of character which was given in the
                  morning discourse was true in its application to himself. Though his convictions
                  were not deep, they were enough so to induce him to confess that he was a sinner
                  against the Supreme Being, and as such was justly under the condemnatory sentence
                  of the divine law. "It is perfectly reasonable that I should confess my sins and
                  accept of the divine clemency which is offered me in the gospel. I will do so; I
                  will repent of my sins, will trust in the atoning, death of Christ for pardon, and
                  will devote myself sincerely to the promotion of his cause." He experienced no
                  great joy when he formed this resolution. It was the results of calm deliberation.
                  He saw that it was his duty, and for that reason was determined to perform it.
               Whilst it cannot be denied that every conversion is effected by the influences of
                  the Holy Spirit, and hence that there is in them all unity in respect to their
                  efficient cause, yet the emotions—the mental characteristics which are experienced
                  at such times—are greatly diversified. In the case of Stephen there was nothing
                  particularly prominent. No pungent distress; no ecstatic joy. Indeed, he could
                  never tell when the great change was experienced. The most satisfactory evidence
                  of piety which he ever had consisted in the real interest which he cherished for
                  the promotion of religion. He was not driven by the fear of punishment, nor drawn
                  by the hope of reward. Mere emotion constituted but a slight element in his
                  conversion. He entered upon a religious life because it seemed to him to be right,
                  and he was determined to do right. He war no fanatic—no enthusiast. Being
                  habitually actuated by settled convictions of what was duty, he was not dependent
                  upon the ever-changing impulses of his nature to move him to action. His change
                  was not particularly perceptible in his external conduct, owing to the fact that
                  in all his deportment he was previously upright, conscientious, and discreet. To a
                  casual observer, there seemed to be no alteration whatever. But there was an
                  alteration. It was evinced in his daily perusal of the Scriptures; in his constant
                  observance of secret prayer; in the sincerity and solemnity of his services in the
                  house of God; and in his efforts to advance, as opportunity offered, the interests
                  of religion.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               AFFECTING NARRATIVES.
               IT was shortly after this important change that Stephen entered upon the discharge
                  of his duties as supercargo of the Reindeer. Not having much to do on shipboard
                  after the voyage had commenced, he spent the most of his time in reading religious
                  books, of which he had furnished himself with a good variety, and by means of
                  which he became well acquainted with evangelical sentiments, and the arguments by
                  which they are supported.
               Although Mr. Williamson disliked the Puritans, and approved the stringent measures
                  which were adopted to suppress them, or to compel them to conform, yet he was not
                  unwilling to aid their escape from the country, even against law, provided he got
                  well paid for his assistance.
               "Puritan pounds," said he, "are current, though Puritan piety is at a discount.
                  The rogues will get to America some way, and I may as well reap the benefit of
                  their emigration tion as others. Besides, as long as I shall be helping to put
                  them out of the way, why should the government complain? By removing the cause, I
                  shall be assisting to allay the agitation of the public."
               How gracefully a man can dupe himself by false reasoning, when it favors his own
                  interest! So long as Mr. Williamson's false logic reasoned money into his pocket,
                  it easily satisfied his judgment and his conscience. He could enter into secret
                  negotiations with the Puritans to furnish them a passage to America, provided they
                  would compensate him handsomely for the risk he incurred of detection and
                  punishment by the government. On terms highly favorable to himself, he had granted
                  passages for a company of thirteen, amongst whom were two ministers. These,
                  however, were not individuals who had separated themselves entirely from the
                  established church of England, but persons who, whilst they cherished an ardent
                  affection for the doctrines and the ceremonies of that church, whilst they loved
                  its liturgy and reverenced its bishops, were yet strongly opposed to the
                  innovations which had been introduced by Archbishop Laud—men who, if novel, and
                  what they deemed Popish rites and customs had not been introduced into the ritual,
                     and made obligatory upon all, would
                  have lived and died in the bosom of the establishment. They loved the church, but
                  mourned over its corruptions.
               From these passengers Stephen learned more of the character of Laud's
                  administration than he knew before. He ascertained the practical working of his
                  novel measures, and learned particularly why it was that they were so unwelcome to
                  a large portion of the people. Whilst to some it seemed a small affair whether,
                  according to the requirements of Laud, they bowed at the name of Christ, when it
                  was uttered in the services by the clergyman, or not; whether they regarded the
                  Lord's supper as a real sacrifice, and the bread as the real body of Christ, or as
                  only a commemorative ordinance, and the bread as a mere symbol; whether the
                  communion table was placed in the centre of the chancel, or at the east side of
                  the chancel, and there made in the form of an altar, having two or three steps for
                  its ascent, and enclosed with a railing—whilst some viewed all these as matters of
                  indifference, yet others regarded them as highly important; made them subjects of
                  conscience, and would not on any account yield to the enjoined innovation. Their
                  refusal to conform to these requirements of the archbishop bishop subjected them
                  to all kinds of annoyances. Men who were sound in the belief of Christian
                  doctrines, unexceptionable in their deportment, and laborious in the discharge of
                  their pastoral duties, and who had occupied for many years the same field of
                  labor, until they were surrounded by large congregations ardently attached to
                  them, were, on account of their non-conformity in these non-essential particulars,
                  fined, censured, and removed from their livings. Many of them were reduced to
                  poverty and suffering. Their people, too, were subjected to similar cruelties. But
                  such was their attachment to what they believed to be truth and duty, that they
                  preferred to endure all this rather than violate their conscience.
               Over two thousand ministers were, on these accounts, deprived of their livings,
                  and prohibited the exercise of their ministerial functions. Many of them were
                  subjected to fines and confiscations, which swept away all their property. Others
                  were beaten, thrown into prison, and treated with the greatest inhumanity, which
                  in some instances resulted in their death.
               "I don't recognize the right of government to compel us to perform religious
                  ceremonies contrary to the convictions of our own judgment and conscience," said
                  Rev. Mr. Blaisedell, when in
                  conversation with others upon the quarter deck.
               "If it is right for government to oblige us to do some things against our
                  conscience, it is right to oblige us to do many things; and then we might as well
                  be destitute of conscience."
               "Very true," replied Mr. Fairbanks. "Though it was a severe trial for me to tear
                  myself away from the spot where I have lived and labored for the last twenty
                  years, yet I have chosen to do it rather than remain there with a polluted
                  conscience. But it was a heavy affliction. There was the garden on which I had
                  bestowed immense pains and labor. During all these years, I have diligently
                  cultivated it. I filled it with the rarest flowers; I planted it with the choicest
                  fruit; I grafted all the trees. Every tree has a history—something peculiar to
                  itself. In that parsonage all my children were born. In the village cemetery are
                  the remains of two of them—one on each side of their mother. With the inmates of
                  every house I was acquainted, and by large numbers I know I was beloved. It was my
                  flock. They had grown up around me, and I felt a shepherd's interest in them all."
                  The good man wept as he called to recollection those whom he had left.
               "Still, with all my attachment for the place and the pulpit, I could not conform
                  and remain with them with a good conscience. With just enough to pay my passage to
                  America, I have left all those objects of interest, to commit myself to the
                  uncertainties of the future, in a new world. I go to enjoy religious liberty—where
                  I shall be permitted to cherish my own religious opinions, without being subjected
                  to the persecuting edicts of the powers that be."
               "I never could see," said Stephen, "what right the government had to dictate to
                  the people their religious creeds."
               "There are many other things which the government does, of which I presume you do
                  not see the rightfulness."
               "Very true; but this has always seemed to me to be so far beyond the proper
                  authority of government, that I wonder the people submit to it."
               "All the people do not submit. Our being on board this vessel to-day is the proof,
                  and the consequence, that we will not submit. No man, whether priest, archbishop,
                  or king, shall coerce my religious views."
               "But are you certain that the colonial government in America will not interfere
                  with your theological views?"
               "How can they? They know the evil of it. Persecution has driven them from their own land. It would be the most palpable
                  inconsistency for them to inflict upon others that from which they have fled
                  themselves."
               "So it seems to me," said Stephen. "They would be as bad as their persecutors, for
                  they would be guilty of similar conduct."
               The effect of the various conversations of Stephen with the passengers was, to
                  awaken in his mind a deep sympathy in their behalf. Although he had been brought
                  up under the influence of the established church, of which his parents were
                  members, of the "straitest sect," who justified every measure of the government,
                  he did not by any means partake of all their views. The laws which had been passed
                  against the non-conformists in the church, and the dissenters who had separated
                  from it, appeared to him both unjust and cruel. He could not, therefore, refrain
                  from rejoicing that an asylum was offered them in the new world, where they would
                  be free from this spiritual tyranny. Each of the company had a personal history of
                  sufferings, arising from the iniquitous policy which had been pursued by Laud. As
                  Stephen became sufficiently acquainted to converse with the different passengers,
                  his astonishment was daily increased by discovering the numerous ways, in which
                  the ecclesiastical laws of the kingdom were fatal to the happiness, not only of
                  those who could not conscientiously comply with them, but to all such also as were
                  in any wise dependent upon these—as wives, children, servants, or workmen.
                  Consequently, his aversion to those laws was greatly increased.
               Finding in him a sympathizing friend, the passengers disclosed to him fully the
                  bitter experience through which they had passed, for not denying what they
                  sincerely believed, or for refusing to perform what they considered was positively
                  wrong. At times his eyes were filled with tears, and his blood boiled as he
                  listened to their affecting and exciting narratives. It was usual for the
                  passengers to have daily devotions on board, and preaching, when the weather would
                  permit. As these exercises received their coloring from the peculiar circumstances
                  in which the Puritans were placed, their tendency was to lessen in the mind of
                  Stephen his prejudices and opposition towards their views, and to create a dislike
                  towards the ritual of the Episcopal church.
               After a passage of moderate length, the Reindeer arrived at Boston. Stephen was
                  now full of business. It was his place to see that all articles of merchandise taken on board, and of
                  which he had kept the account, were delivered or accounted for. This being over,
                  he looked around for a boarding-place, and after considerable trouble, nearly all
                  the houses being filled by the new arrivals, he succeeded in obtaining
                  accommodations.
               A small attic chamber, only large enough to contain his trunk and bed, with a
                  small table, and a single chair, were all the conveniences that could be afforded
                  him. With these he managed to make himself quite comfortable.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               SUSPECTED HERETICS.
               BY means of letters which he had brought with him from England, Stephen was soon
                  introduced to the most prominent families of the colony. The character and social
                  position of his father, being well known, assisted in eliciting the interest of
                  the people in his behalf. It was not long before he obtained a desirable situation
                  in the store of Mr. Strongfaith Bates. This was a peculiar establishment. As a
                  store, it furnished the colonists with such groceries, dry goods, and other
                  articles for domestic purposes, as they were not supplied with from other sources.
                  In addition to this, it was a place of exchange, or barter, where the productions
                  of the English were exchanged for the furs, moccasons, game, and other articles
                  brought into the settlement by the Indians. Being both the store and the "trucking
                  house" of the colony, it was a place of public resort for the men—a kind of social
                  exchange, where were picked up all the floating items of intelligence, and where all the topics of the times were
                  freely discussed. It was a place of so much importance in the infant settlement,
                  that the dignitaries in the church and state did not think it unbecoming their
                  position to visit it, and, as occasion required, to take part in conversation. At
                  different times, principles of law, government, and religion were there fully
                  canvassed. This furnished Stephen with the opportunity of learning more of the
                  Puritan character and spirit than he could have acquired in any other position in
                  the town.
               One day, when several of them, according to their usual practice, had assembled
                  there, among whom were Endicott, Pynchon, and Dudley, three leading men in the
                  colony, the conversation turned upon a subject that had occasioned considerable
                  excitement amongst the people.
               "I am somewhat suspicious," said Endicott, in a low confidential tone of voice,
                  that our brother of the mill is tainted with this pestilent heresy."
               "Indeed! what makes you think so?" asked Pynchon.
               "I noticed," continued Endicott, "that last Sabbath, when our pastor was baptizing
                  the child of brother Aldersey, he held his head down, and refused to behold the
                  edifying ordinance."
               "We must keep our eye upon him, then, for the apostle, you know, commands us to
                  'mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye
                  have learned; and avoid them.'"
               "And a wise command it is, too, Dudley; for unless we deal with these errorists
                  with a strong hand, their heresy will spread as doth a pestilence."
               "True, true," said Pynchon; "'the surest way is to nip it in the bud—to crush the
                  viper while it's young."
               Stephen, who was at the desk, making an entry of some goods he had just sold,
                  paused in his writing at hearing such language.
               "I fear," said Endicott, "that we shall have more trouble with these errorists
                  than some of us dream of. I learn that there are a number of them in different
                  parts of the colony. We may rest assured that they will not keep quiet. Their past
                  history, as well as that of the stiff-necked Familists, shows that they are not
                  content with holding their opinions; but, as a matter of religious duty, they are
                  active in making proselytes. Their heresy is like the leprosy, very spreading and
                  contagious. And if I could have my way,
                  I would treat them as lepers were anciently treated—I would shut them up by
                  themselves; or, if they ran loose, I would have their heads shaved, their lips
                  covered, and oblige them, whenever any one approached them, to cry out, 'I am
                  unclean, unclean.' They are like prolific weeds in the garden of the Lord. The
                  sooner they are rooted up, the better will it be for Zion."
               "I hope," said Pynchon, "that the great Head of the church will give our godly
                  ministers and magistrates the wisdom that cometh from above, and which is
                  profitable to direct in every emergency."
               The impression made on the mind of Stephen by this conversation was painful. It
                  seemed to him as if he detected the spirit of Laud in the remarks he had heard. If
                  the principles which had been expressed were to be carried out, he thought they
                  would lead to scenes similar to those which had been acted under the direction of
                  the archbishop. He experienced special solicitude for the suspected heretic,
                  although he knew not who it was.
               "I think," said Dudley, addressing himself to Endicott, "that you had better
                  inform the minister of your suspicions immediately, and let him, as the priest did
                  under the Jewish law, examine the supposed leper; for you know that, under the
                  law, if a man was suspected of having the leprosy, he was brought to the priest
                  for examination, and if the hair of the flesh was turned white, and the plague in
                  sight was deeper than the skin of his flesh, the priest declared it leprosy, and
                  the man was treated as unclean.*
                   In like manner our minister ought to have an interview with our mill
                  brother, to see whether your suspicions are correct—whether the hair in the plague
                  is turned white, and whether the sore is more than skin deep."
               
                  
                  *Lev. xiii. 3.
               
               "Well," said Strongfaith, who had thus far been a silent, though, for special
                  reasons, a deeply-interested listener, "suppose the sore proves to be not only
                  skin deep, but heart and soul deep—what then?"
               "What then!" echoed Endicott, with unusual warmth; "why, let our godly Cotton, who
                  is a skilful physician in treating diseased souls, administer a spiritual
                  medicine. By the application of a strong theological plaster he may heal the
                  sore."
               "But suppose the application is unsuccessful; suppose the sore is irritated,
                     and becomes inflamed by the
                  treatment; what then?"
               "What then!" repeated Endicott, with earnestness; "why, I would have him brought
                  before the church and the magistrates, and treated as all heretics deserve."
               A number of customers now entered the store, who interrupted the conversation, and
                  the parties separated.
               After they had left the store, as they were walking slowly through the street,
                  Endicott, who was walking between the other two, said, in a low, measured tone of
                  voice, "Do you know whether Strongfaith Bates is well established in the
                  truth?"
               "I know nothing to the contrary," replied Pynchon. Dudley remained silent.
               "I did not like," continued Endicott, "his questions, nor his manner of
                  propounding them. Why is he so anxious to know how the mill brother would be
                  treated if guilty of heresy, unless he have a little of the bad leaven
                  himself?"
               "True, true," said Dudley; "and why should he have indulged the supposition that
                  the treatment of the minister would increase the difficulty, unless he was well
                  convinced of the obstinacy of the case?"
               "It would not be surprising if they had had private conferences upon the
                  subject."
               "And, as birds of a feather flock together, they probably sympathize with each
                  other."
               "We must endeavor to ascertain the facts," said Pynchon, "for the question has
                  crossed my mind, more than once, Why do those who are known to be tainted with
                  this heresy frequent Bates's store. I should think that he had the custom of them
                  from all the different settlements, for I have seen suspicious persons there from
                  Weymouth, Swansea, and Lynn; and now I remember what I had forgotten—that last
                  week I took up his Bible in the store, and upon opening it, found that the leaves
                  were turned to several passages referring to the disputed subject."
               "Indeed!" replied Endicott, "evidence thickens. We must be on our guard, or we
                  shall find these errorists will increase like the locusts of Egypt."
               "Yes, and like them they will destroy every green thing in the garden of the
                  Lord," added Dudley. "The evil must be prevented, and if it can be brought about
                  in no other ways we must use an iron rod, as we did in the case of the heretical
                  and blasphemous Gorton, and his
                  adherents." This was said with emphasis.
               The parties now reached a corner of the street, or more properly road, were they
                  separated; each going in a different direction homeward.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               A NAME EXPLAINED.
               AFTER the customers had been waited upon, and all had left the store, Stephen
                  asked his employer what heresy was alluded to, in the conversation he had just
                  heard.
               "They call it Anabaptism, and those who hold to it Anabaptists; but that, I think,
                  is a term of reproach."
               "Anabaptists?" said Stephen, musingly; "and who are they?"
               "They are persons who maintain that the doctrine of infant baptism is not taught
                  in the Scriptures—that none only but those who have repeated of sin, and believed
                  in the Lord Jesus Christ, ought to be baptized, and that the ordinance can be
                  properly administered only by immersion."
               "But why do they call them Anabaptists?" inquired Stephen, with a strong accent
                  upon the first syllable of the word.
               "As explained by our minister, in a sermon which he preached against this people a
                     few Sabbaths ago, the word Anabapitism means re-baptism, or baptism again; and it is given to
                  them because they baptize, or immerse those who have received the ordinance in
                  their infancy."
               "That is," continued Stephen, "if a person who has been sprinkled in infancy is
                  afterwards convinced that that was not baptism, and then, upon his own profession
                  of repentance and faith, is baptized by immersion, him they call an
                  Anabaptist."
               "Yes, precisely."*
               
               
                  *We have given, in the above conversation, the common opinion respecting the
                     views of the Anabaptists. But recent researches into their history have
                     shown that these popular opinions are incorrect. The Anabaptists were not,
                     as a general thing, immersionists. Their history abounds with instances of
                     their administering sprinkling. When they baptized by immersion, it was an
                     exception to their general practice. They were called Anabaptists because they denied the validity of the baptism of the Papal
                     church, and re-sprinkled or baptized those who had received the ordinance at
                     the hands of Romish priests. They were very far, therefore, from embracing
                     the sentiments of the Baptists of the present day; and cannot, with the
                     least propriety, be identified with them.
               
               "Do you know any of these people?" asked Stephen.
               Mr. Bates paused. He knew that these people were objects of dislike and hatred to
                  the Puritans, and would probably be proceeded against ecclesiastically and
                  legally, by the church and the government, and he did not wish to be known as one
                  of their confidential acquaintances, lest that fact should become public, and he
                  be called upon to testify against them, and perhaps be officially censured
                  himself. Although he knew that Stephen was not a member of any church, yet he was
                  ignorant of his views upon the question at issue between that people and the
                  standing order; he therefore carelessly remarked,in reply to his inquiry—
               "Some of them come in here occasionally."
               "Are they timid about expressing their sentiments?"
               "Not at all. I have heard them argue here with some of our church, by the hour
                  together."
               "What is their character?"
               "They are honest, upright men; firm believers in the gospel of Jesus Christ;
                  conscientious; fearless, but perhaps a little too forward in making known their
                  dissent from the doctrine of infant baptism."
               "Are they in danger of persecution?"
               "Why, as to that, you heard what was said here a few moments ago, by those three
                  brethren, from which you may draw an inference."
               "My inference, then, is," replied Stephen, instantly, "that if those three persons
                  expressed the real spirit of the leading men of the colony, these Anabaptists will soon find themselves in hot
                  water. I thought I could detect in their manner and tones of voice the same
                  persecuting hate which I frequently saw the Episcopalians in my father's house
                  exhibit towards the non-conformists. O, how much cruelty was inflicted upon them
                  because they would not, and could not with a good conscience, comply with the
                  despotic laws of the kingdom concerning religious matters!"
               "I know all about it," replied Mr. Strongfaith Bates, "for I passed through the
                  ordeal with my brethren, and to escape it we came to this uncivilized wilderness;
                  settled down amid savage beasts, and more savage men, that here we might enjoy our
                  religious opinions unmolested by government."
               "And yet," said Stephen, "you are about to pursue the same course against these
                  unoffending Baptists that you so strongly condemn when directed against
                  yourselves. Is this consistent?"
               A slight smile lighted up the countenance of Strongfaith. He was pleased with the
                  tenor and spirit of Stephen's remark and question, and to draw him into a more
                  full commitment of himself, he replied,—
               "What do you think of it?"
               "I think of it?" said he, with considerable animation; "I will tell you;" and
                  then, speaking more deliberately, but with no less emphasis than before, he added,
                  "If the Puritans persecute these people because of their difference of religious
                  principle and practice, they ought forever to keep silent respecting the cruelties
                  themselves received from the established church at home. Their own course will
                  justify the persecuting measures of Archbishop Laud. They will develop a similar
                  spirit, and be in like manner guilty of injustice and cruelty."
               "Then you would have no sympathy with a church or government which should attempt
                  to crush what they believed to be religious errors, by severe penal
                  enactments?"
               "No. I go for freedom of thought."
               Mr. Bates was now relieved. He knew not but that Stephen was in sympathy with the
                  rulers, and might become an informer, and in that case he was aware that in the
                  course of time he would be able to make disclosures of a most important nature, as
                  his store was the only common resort of these suspected citizens, who there
                  expressed themselves freely. He therefore resolved to make a confidant of his
                  clerk in religious as well as in commercial affairs, and let him know exactly how he stood.
                  Stephen would then perceive, he thought, the best course to pursue, when any of
                  the church or the civil officers were in the store. It would make him more
                  attentive to what was uttered by others, and more prudent in what he said himself.
                  He accordingly replied,—
               "There are a considerable number amongst us who go for the same thing; individuals
                  who are very free, not only to think for themselves, but also to give utterance to
                  their thoughts. It is proper that you should know, Stephen, that these Baptists
                  are scattered around in the different settlements, and almost all of them are my
                  customers. They come here from Rehoboth, Swansea, and Lynn, and as I always
                  express a tolerant spirit towards them, and manifest an interest in their welfare,
                  they have made quite a confidant of me. Indeed, I have heard them argue so
                  frequently upon the points at issue between them and us, that I am not so sure
                  they are wrong. Still, I am not prepared to yield the ground. To own the truth,
                  Stephen, I am examining the whole subject for myself. This I have never done
                  before. My parents believed in the validity of infant baptism, and had it
                  administered to all their children. The ministers under whose instructions I have
                  always sat repeatedly preached upon its importance. I have, therefore, taken it
                  for granted, as correct. And this, I presume, is the case with many others. They
                  believe in it as a scriptural ordinance, because their parents and pastors have so
                  taught them. They have never examined the subject for themselves.I
                  have heard so much upon this topic recently, that my faith in infant sprinkling is
                  a little shaken, and I am determined to settle the matter by as thorough an
                  examination of the whole ground as I am capable of giving it."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               A THRILLING ADVENTURE.
               THE conversation was now interrupted by the entrance of a customer. After he was
                  waited upon, Stephen went home to tea, pondering with deep thoughtfulness upon the
                  things that he had heard. His course led him near one of those brooks of which, at
                  that day, there were a number which ran into the harbor. This was one of the
                  widest and deepest. Over it was thrown a rough bridge of logs. As in flood tide
                  the salt water of the ocean flowed into this stream, bearing with it, at different
                  seasons of the year, a variety of the finny tribes, it was a great fishing-place
                  for the boys. Sometimes with lines, at other times with nets, they might here be
                  seen busily engaged in what was to them a profitable sport. As Stephen crossed the
                  bridge, he noticed a small boy sitting astride the end of a log which projected a
                  little distance over the side of the bridge. As the little fellow turned to look
                  upon the passing stranger, it seemed to Stephen that his features were familiar.
                  "Surely," thought he to himself, "I have seen that face before, but where I cannot
                  tell." He did not, however, stop to ask his name, but pressed on towards home. He
                  had not gone far before his attention was arrested by a simultaneous loud cry from
                  a number of the children. He turned to ascertain the cause. He saw that all the
                  boys on the bridge were in confusion. Fishing was suspended. Two or three of the
                  larger boys had commenced running up along the banks of the stream. The cries
                  continued: the words "Help! help!" he could distinctly recognize. He immediately
                  ran back with all speed. Before he arrived at the bridge, he learned the nature of
                  the trouble. "A boy overboard! a boy drowning!" reached his ear. The group of
                  children were filled with dismay.
               "Where did he fall in?" asked Stephen, as rapidly as he could speak.
               "Here; but the tide has carried him away."
               The water was deep; the current was flowing strongly, and the boy was under the
                  surface. There seemed no chance of saving him. Presently he was seen to rise some
                  distance up the stream. "There he is," shouted a dozen voices at once.
               Stephen started off towards the drowning lad with the swiftness of the wind. Whilst running along the bank, he threw off
                  his hat and coat, so as to be as little encumbered as possible. Seeing that the
                  tide was sweeping the little fellow along, he concluded to get ahead of him, and
                  then leap in the water, and seize him as he floated towards him. But whilst
                  deciding upon the course to be adopted, the boy again disappeared. "He is gone."
                  "I'm afraid we shan't get him." "O, how his mother will feel!" said the children,
                  speaking to one another as they ran along the shore.
               Stephen had passed on until he had gotten beyond where he supposed the boy had
                  been carried by the current. Here the bank was elevated, and projected a short
                  distance into the stream, forming a miniature cape. On this bank he paused, and
                  looked down the stream to see if there were any indications of the child's
                  approach. Presently he saw something dark under the water, being borne along by
                  the strong current. Whether it was the boy he knew not. But believing that if he
                  passed that point it would be impossible to save him, and thinking it unlikely
                  that any other large object would be carried into the brook such a distance from
                  the harbor, he resolved to solve his doubts.
               "Isn't that he?" said a boy, pointing to the same object as it neared the
                  bank.
               "I'll see," said Stephen, and immediately plunged head foremost into the stream.
                  He swam under the water, and in a few moments rose, with one hand firmly grasping
                  the garments of the drowning child.
               "He's got him, he's got him," said the children as they collected together on the
                  bank.
               Stephen had no idea of the strength of the current. It was with difficulty that he
                  kept himself and the child above the water.
               There was danger of their being swept by the little cape, and in that case, as the
                  brook widened into quite a pond, the chance of saving the boy would be greatly
                  diminished. Fully realizing all the circumstances of the case, and strongly
                  excited by the occasion, Stephen put forth almost superhuman power. Holding the
                  child with one hand, and swimming as well as he was able with the other, he
                  succeeded in reaching the shore and laying the boy upon the grass.
               The moment Stephen saw his features, he recognized them as those of the little boy
                  whom he had seen sitting astride the log on the bridge. They appeared familiar. "I
                  have surely seen this child before, but where or when I know not." In an instant the truth flashed
                  upon his mind. "O, can it be? I will know. Whose boy is it?" asked he.
               "There is his father," said one of the children, as a man, who had just arrived,
                  pressed his way through the crowd. Stephen looked at him earnestly, and had his
                  hopes strengthened. "O, my son, my son! the Lord hath delivered thee from deep
                  waters." The little boy, who was insensible when first brought to the shore,
                  gradually came to. As he opened his dark eyes, after being rubbed by Stephen and
                  his father, he faintly said, "Am I here? am I alive?"
               "Yes, my son, God hath snatched thee from destruction, and to him be the
                  glory."
               "O, I thought," said the little boy, "when I first saw the light, that I was in
                  heaven, in the midst of the angels, and that I saw the glory of God."
               "No, Abel, that was illusion; thanks to the Lord, you are still with us."
               "Abel, Abel!" thought Stephen; "that was her father's name! It would be strange if
                  my suspicions should prove correct."
               A number of men were now collected around, one of whom said, "Mr.
                     Eaton, had we not better carry the boy to the house?"
                  
                     pp. 199 and 200.
                  
               
               Stephen needed no more. The whole mystery was now cleared up. He had never seen
                  the boy before, but he had beheld similar features. There was a resemblance, also,
                  in the countenance of the father. And if any doubt had existed in his mind, it was
                  removed upon hearing their names.
               After the boy had revived more fully, some of the neighbors offered assistance to
                  carry him home.
               "Not," said Mr. Eaton, "till I have rendered thanks to him whom the Lord used as
                  the instrument of saving him. Where is he?"
               They looked around, but Stephen was nowhere to be seen. So soon as he ascertained
                  who the little boy was, he took advantage of the first favorable moment, when the
                  attention of all was centred upon the child, and quietly slipped off. On his way
                  home, he was filled with conflicting joyous emotions. "Another chain unites me to
                  Priscilla. I have saved her brother from death. I have seen her father. I know the
                  place of their residence. How strange that this should be the manner of my finding
                  them. I wonder if Priscilla found them—if she is now with them. O that I
                  knew!"
               These, with thoughts of a similar nature, opened the fountains of his tears. Again
                     and again did he brush these proofs
                  of intense emotion from his eye.
               Not having heard from Priscilla since her arrival, except through the captain of
                  the vessel that brought her over; not knowing whether she had found her parents,
                  and if she had not, being ignorant of their feelings towards his own parents and
                  himself, Stephen felt great delicacy about revealing himself. He thought it best
                  to slip away for the present, and let things take their natural course.
               In a settlement so small as Boston was then, it was impossible for the clerk of
                  any store not to be generally known; so that, although Stephen disappeared from
                  the crowd, it was an easy matter for Mr. Eaton to learn from the children that he
                  was the young man connected with Mr. Strongfaith Bates's store. "I will see him
                  then soon, and let him know my gratitude for his heroic kindness. Can you tell me
                  his name?"
               "Stephen Williamson," was the answer.
               "Williamson, Williamson," thought Mr. Eaton; "can it be one of the family to whom
                  Priscilla was taken when she was so unfortunately left behind in England? It may
                  be so; and if so, he may not be particularly pleased to form our acquaintance. She
                  certainly mentioned one of the name of Stephen in her letter, after her arrival.
                  She expressed much interest in him too. How mysterious are the ways of Providence!
                  Truly, his ways are past finding out.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               SINGULAR DISCOVERIES.
               THE delivered boy was taken home, and all the circumstances related to his mother.
                  After the little fellow was carefully placed in bed, the two parents knelt and
                  offered devout and earnest thanksgiving to God for his delivering mercy. They
                  prayed that, as Moses, after he was drawn from the waters of the Nile, became an
                  eminent servant of God, so their son might, after this perilous adventure, devote
                  himself to the service of the same holy Being, and become in some humble sense a
                  leader of the hosts of Israel.
               They remembered also his deliverer, and prayed that he might be under the special
                  protection of Heaven.
               A number of the neighbors, under the impulse of friendly interest, now came in to
                  congratulate the Eatons upon the signal favor which they had received from divine
                  Providence.
               "The dear little boy," said the talkative Mrs. Strangger. "O, how I should have
                  missed him. He stopped almost daily at my house, and was always so interesting! It
                  seemed to me as if he knew every body in the colony." The truth was, Mrs.
                  Strangger, in order to make a few pennies, had placed in the one window of her
                  little hut, which opened on the road, some cakes, a few toys, and two or three
                  gaudily painted Scripture pictures, to attract the attention of the children on
                  their way to and from school. She had, also, a few bunches of different kinds of
                  roots and herbs, which she sold to such of the colonists as were afflicted with
                  the complaints for which the little bent old woman said they were a sovereign
                  remedy. She kept an embryo store. When the children stepped in to spend a penny,
                  which occasionally came into their possession, the inquisitive storekeeper would
                  enter into conversation with them, and, in connection with all the floating news,
                  and her sage comments upon them, she managed to introduce a variety of questions
                  concerning the domestic affairs of their own and their neighbors' families. In
                  this way she kept herself supplied with the latest information respecting not only
                  the prominent, but also the minor events of the colony. It was a great mystery to
                  some how she learned so much about
                  others. No boy was more communicative than little Abel Eaton. Being of an amiable
                  disposition, he was a favorite with the colonists, and, mingling freely amongst
                  them, he learned much concerning their respective family matters. Being
                  unsuspicious and communicative, Mrs. Strangger was able to obtain more news from
                  him, respecting the affairs of others, than from any other child that dropped into
                  her store. She meant, therefore, all she said in the remark she had just made. She
                  would have missed him greatly.
               "How wonderful has been the mercy God has conferred upon you!" said one. "How
                  great is your occasion for thanksgiving!"
               "True, true," interrupted Mrs. Strangger; "and if they are not thankful, a great
                  change has come over them; for Goodman Eaton has always been accustomed to lay a
                  thank offering upon his domestic altar, whenever any special blessing has been
                  conferred."
               "I know not," said another, "why such an offering should not be placed upon the
                  altar every day. For truly, to deliver a child from the water is not a greater
                  blessing than to prevent a child from falling into the stream. Here some of us
                  have children of various ages. They have been down to that bridge, and to other
                  exposed places, hundreds of times, and have never fallen in. Why should we not be
                  as thankful for preventing mercy as our sister Eaton for delivering favor?"
               "A good thought. We are prone to overlook our common blessings, and dwell with
                  interest upon those only which are unusual. I have just come from sister
                  Painter's, who, you know, is just recovering from a long and painful illness,
                  which has followed her confinement. If she has reason for gratitude that her
                  health is returning, how much greater reason have we, that ours has not left us!
                  During these long and weary weeks that she has been suffering from her distressing
                  malady, we have been free from pain. Should we not, then, be truly thankful?"
               As Abel had now fallen into a gentle slumber, the company conversed in lower tones
                  of voice, and soon after left the house.
               After partaking of their frugal evening meal, and offering the usual evening
                  prayer, in which there were again special allusions to the deliverance of their
                  dear boy from a watery grave, Mr. Eaton went down to Mr. Bates's trucking house,
                  to express his obligations to the young man who had saved his son. Fortunately,
                  Stephen, who had had time to change his garments ments, take his tea, and return, was alone in the
                  store. A favorable opportunity was thus afforded for uninterrupted
                  conversation.
               When Mr. Eaton entered the store, Stephen was reading the Bible. He raised his
                  eyes from the book as he perceived some one entering, and when they beheld each
                  other, they were both abashed. Each was strongly confident who the other was,
                  whilst each believed himself unknown. Both thought that they had the advantage of
                  the other, but were ignorant what would be the other's feelings if a disclosure
                  should be made; and yet both were resolved that a disclosure should be made before
                  they separated. They were both filled with anxiety and suspense, each hoping to
                  derive from the other new information respecting the same individual,
                  yet uncertain whether such information would be received. Priscilla was in the
                  minds of both!
               "I have come," said Mr. Eaton, with puritanic formality, "as in duty bound, to
                  express to you the indebtedness of myself and wife for your deliverance, under
                  God, of our only boy, and for aught we know, our only child, from a watery grave.
                  To express the fulness of our feelings is impossible. We can only say that from
                  our inmost souls we thank you, and pray God that you may meet with an abundant
                  reward."
               "I have only done my duty," was the brief reply of the embarrassed young man.
               "That does not lessen our obligations of gratitude," rejoined Mr. Eaton. "What may
                  I call your name?" continued he, anxious to reach the denouement as soon as
                  possible.
               "Williamson—Stephen Williamson."
               "It seems to me I have heard that name before."
               "Very likely; for my father is a merchant engaged in the American colonial
                  commerce, and his vessels often visit New England. But may I know whom I have the
                  pleasure of addressing?"
               "My name is Abel Eaton."
               "I can say then, with you, sir, it seems to me as if I had heard that name before
                  I came here."
               "I know not how that can be, unless you were acquainted with my lost
                  daughter."
               Stephen's heart sank within him. "Is she then lost? Shall I never see her again?"
                  thought he; but no time was left for revery. Recovering himself from the
                  abstraction which this remark of Mr. Eaton occasioned, he asked,—
               
               "What was your daughter's name?"
               "Priscilla," answered the father.
               "I knew a young girl of that name once. She lived in my father's family, until she
                  came to this country in one of my father's vessels."
               "What was the name of the vessel?" asked Mr. Eaton.
               "The Reindeer," was the reply.
               "Indeed; then you are the Stephen whom Priscilla wrote of in her letter."
               "And you are Priscilla's father." They both, as with one impulse, grasped each
                  other, and shook hands with as much warmth as though they were old, confidential
                  friends, meeting after a long separation.
               "Do you know the whereabouts of Priscilla now?" asked Stephen.
               "That's the very question I was about to ask you."
               When they learned, as they soon did, that they were equally ignorant of
                  Priscilla's present condition, or of any evidence whether she was dead or alive,
                  they then indulged in conversation upon their reminiscences of her. Stephen told
                  all that he knew of her prior to her leaving England, not omitting the unkindness
                  which she received because of her aversion to prelacy, though he endeavored to
                  avoid indulging in any censures of his parents. The manner in which he expressed
                  himself, however, convinced Mr. Eaton that he had no sympathy, either with this
                  unkindness, nor with the spirit of which it was the fruit; whilst, on the other
                  hand, Stephen was soon convinced that Mr. Eaton had no unfriendly feelings towards
                  him.
               They each communicated to the other all that they knew of the missing girl. She
                  was a link by means of which they became more strongly united.
               After this, Stephen became an intimate friend with the Eatons. He was as free in
                  his intercourse with the family as though it were his own. The more they saw of
                  him, the more they discovered to respect and love. He and little Abel could not
                  have been more attached if they had been brothers.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXX.
               A CLOUD GATHERING.
               THE trio of stern Puritans, who, a few days before, had, in Mr. Bates's store,
                  expressed their fears respecting the spread of the Baptists, were, by a kind of
                  peculiar sympathy, frequently drawn together. At the close of service one lecture
                  day, after Parson Cotton had preached a long and forcible sermon against the
                  spread of heresy, they were attracted to each other, and walked away from the
                  meeting house together.
               "Our godly minister was graciously helped of the Spirit to-day," said Endicott,
                  commencing the conversation.
               "Yes, he spake the truth with great boldness and power," replied Dudley.
               "I could not help thinking," said Pynchon, "when he was pouring out his burning
                  anathemas upon heretics with so much edifying earnestness and eloquence,—I could
                  not help thinking of the description of the Son of man which is given us in the
                  first chapter of the Revelation, and especially of that part which informeth us
                  that out of his mouth goeth a sharp, two-edged sword; for verily the word of our
                  person to-day was quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword upon
                  all errorists and schismatics."
               "Did you notice the effect upon our brother of the mill?"
               "No; he sits not within my view in the sanctuary; but I suppose he hung his head
                  like a guilty criminal hearing his sentence pronounced."
               "Far from it. His head was erect, and he continued looking with the greatest
                  boldness——"
               "Impudence, I should say," interrupted one of the others—
               "Into the minister's face, till he closed the sermon. No one would have suspected,
                  from his appearance, that any thing said from the pulpit was in the least degree
                  applicable to him."
               "That's always the policy of heresy. Its companions are hypocrisy and
                  effrontery."
               "Let that be as it may," replied Dudley, "I have no doubt this heresy is
                  spreading. Information has reached me that some whom we little imagine are
                  becoming tainted with it. The obligation is becoming more and more imperative tive for us to arrest it by wholesome
                  laws; and unless we erect a high and strong barrier, by stringent enactments, it
                  will overflow the country like the waters of a deluge."
               "'Tis even so. The arm of the civil power must be extended for the protection of
                  the interests of the church. Unless this theological miasma be arrested, it will
                  poison our whole community, and defeat the object of our settlement in this waste
                  howling wilderness."
               "You are correct. With immense labor, expense, and self-sacrifice, we have
                  crossed, at the hazard of our lives, the wide waste of three thousand miles of
                  water, to establish a colony in the midst of uncleared forests and untamed
                  savages, that we and our children might escape not only the sword of persecution,
                  but, what is worse, the contaminating influence of pestilent heresies.
                  Self-preservation and obligation to our families require us to deal with these
                  errorists. If Baptists, Familists, and other errorists be tolerated in the midst
                  of us, and allowed to diffuse their pernicious doctrines, it will not be long
                  before 'Ichabod' will be written upon the fairest portions of Zion, for her glory
                  will have departed."
               "You think, then," said Pynchon, "we must suppress it by law?"
               "There is no other way," replied Dudley. "If we resort to the wholesome discipline
                  of fines, whippings, prisons, and banishments, we may purify ourselves from this
                  contagion; but otherwise it will spread as doth a canker. To connive at it will be
                  like conniving at the weeds in one's garden. All they desire from the law is to be
                  let alone; but to let then alone is to let them grow. Let a plague, a pestilence,
                  a conflagration alone——"
               "Our danger is the more imminent," interrupted Endicott, "from certain great names
                  among us who greatly encourage them."
               "True; it is one of the mysteries of Providence that so good, and learned, and
                  able a man as Dunster should have been seduced into any of these errors. If he had
                  not allowed himself to be blinded in this matter, he might have continued at the
                  head of the college, and made himself a bright and a burning light for years to
                  come."
               "Verily thou speakest wisely; but his denial of the sacred ordinance of infant
                  baptism showed, as the apostle saith, that 'Satan had gotten the advantage of
                  him.' The plague spat was upon him, and it was unsafe to retain him in a position
                  of so much influence. He might have infected the whole school."
               
               "Strange that the first president of Harvard College should have been tainted with
                  this heresy."
               "And not only the first, but the second also; for you recollect that Chauncy has
                  no faith in sprinkling, whether of the old or the young, but insists that dipping,
                  or the immersion of the whole body in water, is essential to the ordinance. How
                  absurd!"
               "Absurd or not, as these are known to be learned men,—persons of note and standing
                  among us,—they will have great influence in giving currency to these dangerous
                  heresies, and beguiling unstable souls."
               They have done so already. Their preaching and their private conversation have
                  already led some astray. As for Dunster, prudent counsels have no effect upon him.
                  He might have retained his office as president of the college, if he had only
                  promised to remain silent upon his favorite error. This he refused.
                  He preferred to relinquish that honorable and useful position, rather than remain
                  quiet upon that obnoxious and mischief-making dogma. If he could control matters,
                  never again would an infant be allowed to receive the sacred seal of the
                  covenant."
               "If he had lived in the days of Moses," added Dudley, "I suppose he would have
                  denied the rite of circumcision to children, though it would have secured his
                  exclusion from the tribes of Israel. Chauncy has shown more wisdom. Though he
                  insists that immersion only is valid baptism, and has administered it in that mode
                  to both young and old, yet he was willing to comply with the conditions of his
                  office, which require, him to abstain from disseminating his sentiments on that
                  subject. He consented to close his lips on doctrine, that be might have the
                  opportunity of opening them for bread."
               "Not entirely so, I trust. He doubtless regards his present position as head of
                  the college eminently favorable for usefulness. He is, therefore, willing to be
                  silent on one point, which he knows the ministry and the government regard
                  erroneous, that he may have the privilege of teaching the youth of the church,
                  branches in which we are all agreed."
               "And there is Lady Moody, too, who is at Lynn. We must endeavor, if possible, to
                  save her. She is an amiable, discreet, religious woman; highly thought of by those
                  who know her. But her conscience is inveigled into an approbation of the spreading
                  heresy to so great a degree, that, like Dunster, she, rejects infant baptism entirely. She is doing much
                  injury to the Lord's heritage there; but if she could be reclaimed, and all this
                  bad leaven eradicated from her, she might become a useful mother in Israel."
               Dudley, with a long sigh, expressed the fear that that was hopeless. Error and
                  fanaticism were nearly inseparable in his view, and the latter always increased
                  the strength of the former. To him reclamation appeared well nigh hopeless.
                  Prevention of its further spreading was, he thought, the true policy. "Let those
                  who are already marked with the leprous spot," said he, "go; but let us labor to
                  prevent the plague from spreading. We must make examples of some of them to deter
                  others."
               Their conversation continued in this strain until they reached Mr. Bates's store,
                  which they all three entered.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               A STORM THREATENING.
               "WELL," said Endicott, addressing Mr. Bates, how does our brother of the mill
                  feel, since he met with that signal rebuke of divine Providence?"
               "Rebuke?" replied Strongfaith, not perceiving the bearing of the question. "I did
                  not know that he had received any."
               "Perhaps," said Dudley, who fully comprehended the drift of the inquiry, "brother
                  Bates does not regard it a rebuke."
               "You are too deep for me," said Bates.
               "As the water was for the drowning boy," immediately rejoined Dudley. Bates now
                  understood them fully.
               "I apprehend," said he, "that he does not view that event in the same light that
                  you do."
               "I see not," replied Dudley, "in what other light he can regard it than as a
                  solemn admonition of him for his dangerous error. He insists upon it there must be
                  a burial in water to render baptism valid; and has not his boy been buried in water nigh unto death? Is it not an
                  intimation that this tampering with sacred ordinances involves great peril?"
               "Ay," said Pynchon, "even as the touching of the tottering ark of the covenant was
                  a terrible offence in Uzzah, and brought down the judgment of Heaven upon his
                  guilty head. We live under a milder administration, and hence our reproofs are the
                  more tender."
               Stephen now for the first time learned that the brother of the mill was Eaton, and
                  that he was tainted with baptistical heresies. He listened, therefore, to the
                  conversation with deep attention. He learned from it that from the first there had
                  been some in the colony who rejected the popular doctrine of infant baptism, and
                  some who denied the validity of sprinkling. But as they were members of the
                  church, attended to all the usages of the Puritans, and were not forward to thrust
                  their opinions upon others, they had not been disturbed. But now the subject was
                  receiving greater attention than ever. The deep and wide-spread agitation which
                  had been occasioned by the sentiments and conduct of Roger Williams, together with
                  the severe treatment which he and others received, had been the means of directing
                  the minds of men to the subject. They read whatever ever books upon this important
                  topic they could find; they searched the Scriptures; they conversed freely upon
                  it, so that there were many occasions of debate between those who cherished
                  opposite sentiments upon this exciting theme. The result was, that a number were
                  convinced of the truthfulness of Baptist sentiments. They refused to bring their
                  children to the church to have them christened; or if they did, it was with great
                  reluctance. Others were desirous that the ordinance should be administered to
                  young and old by immersion; they did not believe that any other mode was valid;
                  whilst a third class maintained not only the necessity of immersion, but insisted
                  further, that the only proper subjects of baptism were those who had repented of
                  sin and believed in the Lord Jesus Christ.
               This conversation opened to Stephen new topics of thought and inquiry, and he
                  resolved to imitate the example of his employer, and make the question of
                  Christian baptism a subject of special investigation.
               From this time these two inquirers after truth had long and frequent conversations
                  upon this topic. All the passages of Scripture referring to it were examined and
                  reëxamined, many times. The arguments of the opposite parties they discussed, and all the light which
                  they could obtain they cheerfully received. Whatever books upon either side of the
                  question they could find, they eagerly read. To their examination they added
                  conscientious and earnest prayer.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               CHURCH AND STATE.
               DURING this process of investigation, a circumstance occurred which would have
                  deterred some minds from prosecuting the subject.
               When Mrs. Painter, to whose sickness we have already referred, was sufficiently
                  recovered to attend meeting, she, being a member of the church, naturally felt
                  solicitous that her infant should receive the ordinance of baptism. She suggested
                  the subject to her husband. Mr. Painter, being one of Bates's customers, had for
                  some time been in the habit of conversing with Strongfaith and Stephen upon the
                  baptismal question, and had become fully convinced of the impropriety of
                  administering the ordinance to infants. Being a conscientious man, he was
                  unwilling that his practice should be in violation of his principles. His wife
                  differed with him upon this subject. It was her desire that their infant child
                  should be carried to the church, and according to the customs of the Puritans,
                  there receive the ordinance. Painter
                  would not consent. He strongly insisted upon it that infant baptism was not a
                  divine ordinance, but an invention of men, and instead of being beneficial, or
                  even harmless, was positively injurious. Frequent, and sometimes warm, were the
                  domestic discussions between the two upon this subject. The wife was unwilling to
                  disobey her husband, and the husband was equally unwilling to sanction by his own
                  example what he believed was a religious error. Parson Cotton was kept informed of
                  all the births that occurred in the town. And being a vigilant and faithful
                  shepherd, he kept his eye upon all these tender lambs, to see that they were
                  solemnly dedicated to God in baptism. He knew all the little ones in town who had
                  received the seal of the covenant, and all who had not. The parents of these
                  latter he did not fail to visit, and remind them of their duty to their offspring.
                  Having noticed that Painter had delayed to bring his last child to the church for
                  the ordinance, he made the family a pastoral call to ascertain the reason. He was
                  not long in discovering that it was owing to the influence of the dreadful plague
                  of heresy which was troubling the colony.
               Painter frankly acknowledged that he had no confidence in the ordinance of infant
                  baptism, and did not believe that it was sustained by any scriptural evidence.
                  This led the good pastor to enter into an argument with him upon the subject. He
                  went over the whole ground, dwelling particularly upon the Abrahamic covenant, and
                  urged every conceivable motive to induce Painter to bring out his child to the
                  ordinance. He was unsuccessful in producing any change in his opinions, or of
                  obtaining from him a promise that his child should be presented for the rite.
                  Painter defended his own views with considerable adroitness and force. He insisted
                  upon it that there was no command in the Scriptures enjoining it as a duty, and
                  therefore he would not have his child baptized. The faithful pastor reminded him
                  that if he persisted in his heresy, the consequences would be painful, and he had
                  better pause, and not proceed further in a course which he would find was strewed
                  with thorns.
               "I will walk," replied Painter, "in the way which I believe is right, though I
                  find it paved with coals of fire."
               "Be not presumptuous, brother; remember you are arraying yourself against both the
                  church and the civil power. To endure the keen edge of the sword of state, and the
                     dreadful ful anathemas of Zion, you
                  will find to be no easy service."
               To this threat, which Painter knew was based upon truth, he firmly replied,—
               "My trust is in God. I believe that his grace will be sufficient for me."
               After a few words of sympathy and consolation to the mother, and an exhortation to
                  her to remain firm in the truth, the parson patted the cheeks of the little infant
                  sitting in its mother's lap, and took his departure.
               A recollection of the sermon which he had preached a short time before, in which
                  he had, with great cogency of reasoning and energy of manner, urged the importance
                  of vigilance to detect the germs of heresy, and destroy them before they had time
                  to grow, strengthened his determination to bring this case before the church at
                  Boston, and have it settled, so that all others, who were in danger of being
                  affected by the same error, might know what to expect, in case they caught the
                  contagion.
               At the next meeting of the church, the defection of brother Painter was presented.
                  The matter was solemnly considered. Some were in favor of immediate exclusion;
                  others urged forbearance, and the desirableness of making efforts to persuade him
                  to abandon his foolish and dangerous error. These latter counsels prevailed, and
                  the pastor and two of the elder brethren were appointed to labor with him, and
                  endeavor to convince him of the truth, and keep him in the bosom of the
                  church.
               These church officials were faithful to their duty. They visited Painter,
                  sometimes together, at other times alone, and had with him long conversations. But
                  they made not the slightest impression on his mind. Neither could they persuade
                  him to say that his child might be baptized, provided that would insure him
                  against ecclesiastical censure.
               "No, rather than consent to what I believe to be an unscriptural and injurious
                  practice, I will suffer any censures the church can pass upon me. I have nothing
                  to fear if I do what I think is right, but every thing if I do what I believe is
                  wrong."
               Finding it impossible to convince him of his error, or even persuade him to
                  consent to the sprinkling of his child, his case was brought before the church for
                  final action, and he was formally excommunicated for heresy, and for a contempt of
                  the ordinance of God.
               This act not only excluded him from the privileges of the church—it also
                     disfranchised him. For it was a law
                  of Massachusetts at that time, that none but members of the church should be
                  entitled to the rights and immunities of freemen. Consequently, Painter could no
                  longer take part in the affairs of the colony, nor even vote for officers.
               His case, however, was not allowed to rest here. This refusal of a poor man to
                  have his child sprinkled was deemed a subject of too great magnitude to escape the
                  vigilance of "the powers that be." Civil government was invoked to protect the
                  interests of the church; and poor Painter was brought by a legal warrant before
                  the court to answer for the great misdemeanor of refusing to perform a religious
                  ceremony which his conscience and judgment both taught him was wrong. It was
                  nowise difficult to find sufficient evidence to convict him. After the facts were
                  all known, the court, with formal dignity, interposed its authority, and ordered
                  Painter to have his child baptized. He, however, was no more disposed to obey this
                  order of court, and conform to Puritan usage, than his judges were to obey the
                  "orders of council," which required conformity to the church of England. In his
                  defence, he maintained that the sprinkling of infants was an unchristian
                  ordinance, and consequently carried with it no obligation whatever. He was
                  conscientiously opposed to it, and he would not violate his conscience to please
                  any court or escape any penalty on earth. The august tribunal before whom he was
                  brought, deemed this a matter of such great magnitude as to require the infliction
                  of a healthful punishment, lest their leniency might encourage others, and thus
                  increase the heresy; they therefore passed sentence that he should be publicly
                  whipped.
               At the appointed time, this theological criminal was taken to the public whipping
                  post, there bound, and in the presence of a multitude, cruelly whipped,
                     because he refused to have his infant sprinkled.
               
               He endured the brutal infliction with great fortitude, and at the close, though
                  faint and trembling from the effects, he thanked God for the grace and strength by
                  which he had been sustained under the painful ordeal.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               EFFECTS OF PERSECUTION.
               THE public whipping of Mr. Painter created no small stir in the colony. There were
                  those who fully approved the deed, and who considered it a truly politic, as well
                  as just procedure. Others, though they regarded Painter as in great error, and
                  justified his exclusion from the church, yet judged his punishment at the whipping
                  post to be both cruel and unwise; a third class, who differed from "the standing
                  order" on various points, considered the measure as a piece of tyrannical
                  persecution, and had their sympathies deeply enlisted in behalf of the sufferer;
                  whilst a fourth class, embracing those who were inclined to Baptist sentiments,
                  instead of having their heretical tendencies corrected by this exhibition of
                  ecclesiastical cruelty, were mare firmly resolved than ever to adhere to what they
                  believed was right. Intelligence of this punishment was soon circulated throughout
                  the colonies, showing to all what they must expect, in case they differed in
                  opinion or practice from the Congregational standard.
               The effect of this upon Stephen and his employer was, to make them more open and
                  bold in the expression of any opinions they cherished which were not in harmony
                  with the standing order. Especially were they more free to converse upon the
                  subject of baptism. Many and long were the arguments which they had with different
                  individuals upon this exciting theme—some of whom strenuously opposed them, while
                  others were greatly moved by their arguments. Neither Mr. Bates nor Stephen was at
                  this time fully converted to the sentiments of the Baptists. They were merely
                  inquirers upon the subject, though it must be confessed that the farther they
                  examined it, the more did they lean to the side of the heresy. The more they
                  became acquainted with the arguments of the Baptists, and with their method of
                  interpreting Scripture, the deeper became the impression upon their minds that
                  this persecuted people were on the side of truth.
               There was one point, however, on which Mr. Bates could not obtain satisfactory
                  information. Although he was a man of strong mind, a clear thinker and sound reasoner, yet he had not
                  been favored with a liberal education, and was ignorant of the ancient languages.
                  It seemed to him that a knowledge of the meaning of the original Greek word,
                  which, in the English version of the Bible was rendered "baptize," was of great
                  importance.
               "If I only knew," said he to Stephen, in one of the frequent conversations he was
                  accustomed to have with his clerk, "how the Greeks, in the days of the Saviour,
                  understood the word which is translated 'baptize,' it would afford me not only
                  relief, but great assistance."
               "You know what the Baptists themselves say upon the subject?"
               "Yes; but many of them are no more learned than myself, and what they assert they
                  have received second-handed, and therefore cannot vouch for its accuracy. What I
                  want is, for some one well acquainted with the ancient languages, to tell me the
                  meaning of the original word 'baptize.'"
               "Why not ask the president of Harvard College," said Stephen.
               "True; I did not think of that. President Chauncy is admitted by all to be a very
                  learned man, and is as competent to give information formation upon this subject,
                  as any man in the new, or the old world."
               The next day a small boat, with two men, was seen crossing Charles River, from
                  Boston to Cambridge. At that time the appearance of the river and the country was
                  widely different from that which now greets the eye. Instead of the numerous
                  bridges which now span the stream for the accommodation of cars, carriages, and
                  foot passengers, it was all open. Not a bridge had been erected, not a pile for
                  the purpose driven. Instead of large cities and towns presenting themselves in
                  every direction, the banks of the river, and the islands of the harbor, with the
                  shores of the bay, were covered with green. Dense forests, beautifully rolling
                  hills, or fertile plains, variegated with a few small villages, with here and
                  there a cluster of Indian wigwams, completed the picture. Now and then, an Indian
                  might be seen paddling his light bark canoe across the water, or pausing in the
                  middle of the stream, engaged in fishing.
               When the boat reached the shore of Cambridge, at a point not far from the present
                  termination of Harvard Street, one of the men left it, and walked towards the
                  college; the other, who was the owner
                  of the craft, remained to prevent it from being stolen by the Indians. The first,
                  who was no other than Mr. Bates on his way to President Chauncy, was soon
                  concealed by the thick underbrush which covered the land.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               A GLEAM OF HOPE.
               IT must not be supposed that either the pressure of business, or the theological
                  fermentation of the colony, banished Priscilla from the mind of either her
                  parents, or of her strongly-attached friend. After Stephen's novel introduction to
                  the Eatons, no topic of conversation was more agreeable to them all than that
                  which referred to the lost girl. It was natural that they all should cherish some
                  slight hope that possibly she might at some time be heard from.
               Every thing that either of them remembered she had ever said or done was told and
                  retold many times. Innumerable were the conjectures respecting her fate, and
                  constant their inquiries concerning her from strangers, who came from other parts
                  of the country, and especially from Indians, of distant tribes, who occasionally
                  came to Boston to trade with the English. To the usual discouraging character of
                  the replies they obtained, there was one exception. The slight gleam of hope which it furnished was before their eyes
                  like a permanent rainbow, for many days. It strengthened the belief that the
                  long-lost Priscilla was living, and that by perseverance and energy she might
                  possibly be found. The event which created this expectation was as follows: Some
                  Indians of the Algonquin nation, who were said to live near Canada, on the borders
                  of Lake Champlain, came to Boston. They pitched their tents on the outside of the
                  town, beyond the hill on which the State House now stands, on land included within
                  the present limits of Boston Common. According to their custom, Mr. Eaton and
                  Stephen visited them, not only for purposes of trade, but also to see if they
                  could learn any thing of the missing girl. By means of an interpreter, they
                  ascertained that white girls were sometimes seen among the interior tribes of
                  Indians, but they knew of none then. As they were leaving the smoky encampment of
                  these wild inhabitants of the forest, a young girl came out of one of the frail
                  skin tents, and stood near the two visitors. Stephen was powerfully affected. He
                  stopped, looked at the girl as though he were fascinated, and for some moments did
                  not speak.
               "What is the matter?" asked Mr. Eaton, who saw that some unusual effect was
                  produced upon Stephen. "Have you ever seen that squaw before?"
               "No; but I think I have something else."
               "What is that?" inquired Eaton, his own interest also increasing.
               "Do you see that piece of cloth which is tied around her?"
               "Yes."
               "The last time I saw Priscilla, she had on a dress of the same kind of
                  material."
               "Is it possible? Then I must have this."
               No difficulty was experienced in making the purchase, for Mr. Eaton made a liberal
                  offer. It was a piece of blue calico with small white leaves.
               "Yes," said Stephen, "the very evening on which she left our house, she had on a
                  dress which she had frequently worn before, of those very figures and colors. I
                  remember them well."
               They now prosecuted inquiries to ascertain where this cloth was procured. But no
                  further information could be obtained than that this young squaw brought it from
                  her distant home. Where it came from no one knew. Mrs. Eaton received it as a rich
                  treasure. After a careful examination of it, she pronounced it part of a girl's frock. The belief, of course,
                  was at once awakened that it was the identical one which Stephen had seen
                  Priscilla wear. This opinion was strengthened, when, upon further inquiry, they
                  could not learn that any of the Indians had ever seen any other piece like it.
               When this article was shown to Mrs. Strangger and Mrs. Mitchel, they both
                  testified that when they first saw Priscilla on board the Reindeer, on their
                  outward passage, she had on a dress of this material. They expressed themselves
                  with confidence upon this point. Hope was awakened that this was a part of
                  Priscilla's own dress.
               Still there was no certainty of this hope being well founded. For "cloth of a
                  similar description," as Mr. Bates said, "might have been obtained by the Indians
                  from the French in Canada, or from the Dutch who have commenced settlements on the
                  Hudson River, and a single fragment might have passed from one tribe to another,
                  and the last recipient not be aware of the existence of any other of the same
                  character."
               "But how, then," inquired the mother, "do you account for its being part of the
                  pattern of a girl's dress? The Indians do not cut their garments after this
                  fashion. It is sewed, too, in English style; examine the seams for yourself. The
                  natives do not sew like this," continued she, as she held up the important article
                  for exhibition.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               PRIVATE CONVERSATION.
               AFTER walking about a mile from the place where he left his companion with the
                  boat, Mr. Bates arrived at the residence of President Chauncy.
               After indulging for a few moments in some passing remarks upon the weather, the
                  country, and the general health of the colony, Mr. Bates informed the president
                  that he had come over to have a few minutes' particular conversation upon a
                  subject in which he was greatly interested.
               "Any assistance I can consistently render you shall cheerfully be given," said
                  Chauncy.
               Mr Bates then informed him of his troubles of mind respecting baptism.
               "Ah," said the president, with a peculiar expression of countenance, in which
                  seriousness and pleasantry appeared to be equally blended, "did you not know that
                  that is a proscribed subject with me?"
               "I knew," said Strongfaith, "that it was the desire of those who called you to
                  your present honored and responsible position, that you should not publicly preach
                  what you conscientiously believed was the truth of God."
               "Do you mean to signify," asked Chauncy, "that your impression was, that they
                  expect me to preach or teach what I do not believe is truth?" at the same time
                  rising and closing the door of the room, which answered the double purpose of
                  chamber and study, that outer ears might not catch the conversation.
               "By no means. They are too upright and honorable to ask you to practise such
                  public hypocrisy."
               "You do well to say that. The ministers and the government of the colony are
                  noble-minded, godly men, who detest deception, especially in the discharge of the
                  sacred functions of the gospel ministry. True, they do not wish me to propagate
                  among the students and people what they are pleased to regard as my peculiar
                  sentiments. But their tongue would cleave to the roof of their mouth before they
                  would ask me to inculcate any doctrine which they knew I regarded as
                  erroneous."
               "I simply meant to say, in what I have just uttered, that I knew you were expected
                  to keep silent upon a certain subject
                  in which you believe——"
               "And yet," said the president, interrupting him, "upon that very subject you wish
                  me to break silence."
               This remark placed Mr. Bates in an unpleasant dilemma. Conscious of entire
                  rectitude in the object of his visit, he was pained at the thought of being
                  suspected of a dishonorable motive. With the confession which he had just made,
                  especially as coupled with the rejoinder of Chauncy, he saw there was enough to
                  excite such suspicion, and he feared that he had trespassed upon the good nature
                  of the president too far. The subject now presented itself in a new light to him.
                  Although he came as an honest inquirer, he was not certain of the propriety of
                  coming even in that capacity. He began to feel that it was an extremely delicate
                  thing to ask so important a personage as the president of a college a question
                  touching a subject on which silence was a condition of his retaining his
                  presidency. Besides fearing that he was sinking in the estimation of Chauncy, he
                  was also losing his own self-respect. Yet below all this was another element which
                  mingled with his experience; it was a feeling of independence arising from his
                  conscious integrity, by which he was convinced that there was no reason for losing
                  his self-respect, and that, by developing the purity of his intention to the
                  president, he would rise also ins Chauncy's esteem. These conflicting feelings of
                  his heart alternated with each other, almost as rapidly, as the lights and shadows
                  cast upon the ceiling of the study by the interrupted reflections of the sun's
                  rays from the troubled surface of the river.
               In a moment a new idea occurred to him, which assisted in extricating him from his
                  embarrassing position. "I will converse with him as a scholar instead of a
                  theologian," thought he; "perhaps he may then view the object of my visit more
                  favorably." So soon as this thought had distinctly formed itself in his mind, he
                  said, though in a somewhat hesitating manner, "Regarding you, sir, as a man of
                  learning, well skilled in the ancient languages, I have come to ask of you the
                  meaning of a certain Greek word, which is found repeatedly in the New
                  Testament."
               "O, ah, yes—I understand—you come to me as one of the faculty of this seat of
                  learning, to ask me a question in philology; that alters the matter entirely;" and
                  the good president, letting both hands
                  fall upon his knees, pushed back his great arm chair, raised himself in a more
                  erect position, and appeared as much relieved as was Bates himself. "Philology,"
                  continued he, "is a legitimate subject of investigation. To translate the ancient
                  languages, and especially those in which the Holy Ghost spake to prophets and
                  apostles, is to me a precious privilege. I see not how any one can make it a
                  ground of complaint. What word is it that you wish to have rendered?"
               "It is that word which expresses the act of baptizing," said Strongfaith.
               "As a philologist, my reply is, that the word which, in the New Testament,
                  expresses the act of baptism, is the Greek word 'baptizo,' the first meaning of
                  which is to immerse, dip, plunge, or overwhelm; out of this arise other secondary
                  and subordinate meanings, such as to wash, cleanse, dye, &c., all of which,
                  however, imply the idea of immersion, or its equivalents."
               "How are we to know," asked Strongfaith, "when the word is used in its primary,
                  and when in its secondary significations?"
               "We learn it from the nature of the subject in connection with which the word is
                  used. The general rule in the translation of one language into another is always
                  to give to a word its primary signification, unless such signification is
                  incongruous with the context, or with the nature of the subject."
               "Pardon me," continued Bates; "but as I wish to have this matter made as plain as
                  possible, let me ask if this is what you mean—when I read any passage in any
                  author where the word 'baptize' occurs, I must give to that word the meaning of
                  immersion, unless such meaning is entirely inconsistent with the context."
               "Precisely so. That you may understand the matter clearly, I will show you some
                  instances of the use of the word from the ancient authors."
               The president rose from his large, leather-bottomed arm chair, and opened the dark
                  door of what Bates had supposed was a large closet, or wardrobe, but which, when
                  opened, he perceived, was well filled with books. It was his library.
               Chauncy stooped down, and took from the lowest shelf a large folio volume, bound
                  in what appeared to be dried parchment, or sheepskin. Seating himself in his arm
                  chair, he carefully opened the volume, saying, "This is a valuable edition of that
                  old Greek author, Diodorus Siculus. I will read from it into English two or three passages where the word
                  'baptize,' in some of its grammatical forms, occurs; but instead of translating
                  that word, I will use 'baptize,' and yourself will readily see how it should be
                  rendered. The first is the account of a confusion of a fleet of vessels; it is as
                  follows: 'The admiral's vessel being baptized, the armament was thrown into great
                  disorder.'"
               "He doubtless means," said Strongfaith, "that the admiral's vessel was sunk, and
                  that this circumstance threw the fleet into great confusion."
               Turning over a few pages, he read another: "'Most of the land animals that are
                  overtaken by the river, (that is, in time of a freshet,) being baptized,
                  perish.'"
               "Surely, 'being baptized' in that passage," said Bates, "must mean being
                  overwhelmed, or sunk; for how otherwise could the animals perish?"
               "Take another," said the president, opening the heavy volume at another place, and
                  reading—"'The river, rushing down with an impetuous current, baptized many, (that
                  is, of the soldiers,) and carried them away as they were swimming with their
                  arms.' How would you understand their being 'baptized' in that passage?"
               "I think," said Strongfaith, "it means that they were overwhelmed by the rushing
                  waters."
               The president now replaced this book, and took down another, somewhat thicker, and
                  bound in dark-colored leather, with two large brass clasps.
               "This contains," said he, "the lives of many ancient warriors and philosophers,
                  written by the laborious and learned Plutarch." He placed it upon a small reading
                  stand with three crooked legs, the top of which was in imitation of an open book,
                  and having found the passage he wanted, he read as follows: "In this whole company
                  there was not to be seen a buckler, a helmet, or a spear; but instead of them,
                  cups, flagons, and goblets. These the soldiers baptized in huge vessels of wine,
                  and drank to each other." Then pausing, he asked Strongfaith what act he supposed
                  was indicated by the word 'baptized' in that passage.
               "Undoubtedly dipping," was the reply. "They dipped out the wine with their cups
                  and goblets, and then drank it."
               "Here is another instance in this same author—it reads as follows: 'Even now, many
                  of the weapons of the barbarians, bows, helmets, fragments of iron, breastplates,
                  and swords are found baptized in the mud, though it is almost two hundred years since the battle.' What do
                  you think is meant by 'baptized' in that passage?" asked the president.
               "I think the writer means to say that these weapons were buried in
                  the mud."
               "Certainly; and this idea of burying is expressed by the word 'baptized.' Let me
                  now refer to a famous old Jewish writer, who lived in the days of the Emperor
                  Vespasian, and was present at the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, his general.
                  In giving an account of the storm that overtook that unfaithful prophet, Jonah,
                  Josephus says, 'that the sailors were not willing to cast the prophet overboard,
                  until the ship was just going to be baptized.' How do you understand that?" asked
                  the president in his usual professional style, as though Bates was one of his
                  pupils.
               "I understand him to say that those mariners hesitated about casting Jonah into
                  the sea, until the vessel was just going to sink in the waves."
               "Very good. Here is a similar use of the word," said he, as he opened the book to
                  another place. "Speaking of a certain city, he says, 'The inhabitants left it as
                  people swim away from a ship which is being baptized.'"
               "Surely, he can mean nothing else than a sinking ship," replied Bates.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED.
               VARIOUS other Greek authors were taken down by the president, and extracts read
                  from them, in which the word "baptize" occurred, and which Mr. Bates saw,
                  unlearned as he was, should be translated "immerse, overwhelm," or by something
                  equivalent.
               "Sometimes," said the president, "the word is used metaphorically, and sometimes
                  hyperbolically, and then it must be understood according to the rules for the
                  interpretation of such use of language. A little common sense is a great help in
                  such cases. These uses of the word, however, do not nullify the fact that its
                  primary and common meaning is to immerse, or dip."
               "Pardon me," said Bates, "if I ask whether learned men generally admit that this
                  is its original signification."
               "As to that, I am willing that they should speak for themselves. Having
                  investigated this word historically as well as philologically," continued the learned president, "I have had
                  occasion to consult the opinions of others, and therefore can turn at once to the
                  volume and the page where their decision is recorded." During the utterance of
                  this language, he crossed the room, and reached from his library a volume which
                  had the appearance of being greatly used.
               "This is a work of Calvin, the eminent Genevan divine. In it I find the following
                  passage, distinguished both for its clearness and strength.". He then read as
                  follows: "The very word 'baptize,' however, signifies to immerse; and it is
                  certain that immersion was the practice of the ancient church.' You can have no
                  doubt as to what was his opinion."
               "I think not," replied Strongfaith.
               Hear, now, what Martin Luther, the great reformer, says." Opening a volume of
                  Luther's works, he read as follows: "The term "baptism" is a Greek word. It may be
                  rendered a dipping, as when we dip something in water, that it may be entirely
                  covered with water. And though that custom be quite abolished among the
                  generality, (for neither do they entirely dip children, but only sprinkle them
                  with a little water,) nevertheless they ought to be wholly immersed, and presently
                  to be drawn out again. For the etymology seems to require it.'"
               After replacing Luther upon the shelf, the president recrossed the room, and took
                  from his study table a smaller volume, which had quite a fresh appearance. "Here,"
                  said he, "is a book written by a learned professor from the north of Holland. His
                  name is Witsius. I was just looking it over as you came in;" and then turning over
                  a few leaves, said, "He uses the following language: 'It cannot be denied that the
                  native signification of the word "baptize" is to plunge, to dip.' Hear, also, what
                  Vitringa says: 'The act of baptizing is the immersion of believers in water. This
                  expresses the force of the word. Thus also it was administered by Christ and his
                  apostles.' I could quote to you various other authors who bear similar testimony
                  to the meaning of the word; but it is now the hour for me to meet my class at
                  recitation. Stay with me and dine, and we will resume the conversation after
                  dinner."
               This kind invitation Bates declined. He had obtained all he came for, and was now
                  desirous to depart. They walked together to the front door of the house,
                  conversing as they went, and then respectfully took leave of each other. Bates had withdrawn from the house but
                  a few steps before Chauncy called after him—
               "Hold; here is one other historical fact of too much importance for you not to
                  consider. And that has reference to the practice of the Greek church. The Greeks,
                  of course, understand their own language. Now, it is a significant fact that the
                  Greek church has for ages been in the habit of administering baptism by immersion,
                  because they understand that to be the meaning of the word. Where can we find
                  better umpires?"
               "A single question more," said Bates, "which I meant to have asked before. Did not
                  the Greeks have words which signified to sprinkle and to pour?"
               "Certainly. 'Rantizo' means to sprinkle, and 'cheo' signifies to pour."
               "Are these words ever used in the New Testament in describing the ordinance of
                  baptism?"
               "Never, never!" said the president, with emphasis.
               "It is certainly very strange," added Strongfaith, "if baptism was an anciently
                  administered by sprinkling or pouring that those words are never used in
                  describing the act, but, on the contrary, that word is always employed which
                  signified to immerse."
               "Very strange, very."
               "Is it not likely, sir, that if sprinkling or pouring had, in any instance, been
                  practised, that word would have been employed by the sacred writers to describe
                  the scene, which signifies to pour or to sprinkle?"
               "You are as able to answer that question as I," said the president; "so farewell,
                  for I must be gone;" and away he slowly walked to meet his class.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               MIDNIGHT INTERVIEW.
               BATES retraced his steps through the underbrush, found the boatman where he left
                  him, and soon recrossed the river.
               During the remainder of the day, no opportunity was offered for conversation with
                  Stephen; but in the evening, after the last customer had left the store, and when
                  the first favorable moment for inquiring had presented itself, Stephen asked the
                  result of the Cambridge interview.
               "Close the store, and you shall know."
               Stephen shut the window shutters, and fastened them, then closed the door, and
                  locked it on the inside. Strongfaith was sitting in an old, broken, rush-bottom
                  chair, with the Bible in his hand; a rushlight, in a greasy brass candlestick,
                  stood on the corner of the counter. The picture was completed by Stephen seating
                  himself upon a rough sugarbox in front of Mr. Bates.
               "Now," said he, "tell me all about it."
               Strongfaith related, as fully as he could remember, the details of the
                  conversation.
               "If all that the president told you is true, it certainly furnishes a strong
                  argument for the Baptists."
               "I think as much; and suppose, now we are alone, that we examine some of the
                  prominent instances of baptism recorded in the New Testament in the light of the
                  information with which he has furnished us. Let us look at them, and see whether
                  the various circumstances connected with them are in harmony with immersion, or
                  whether they are more consonant with some other mode of administration."
               It is not necessary to give at length the conversation of these two sincere and
                  earnest inquirers after truth. It will be sufficient for our purpose to say that
                  the conclusion at which they arrived was, that the various circumstances which are
                  related in connection with the New Testament baptisms, were absolutely necessary,
                  in case immersion was the practice, whilst, on the other hand, they were not only
                  unnecessary, but also incongruous with any other mode.
               "It seems to me," said Strongfaith, "that the evidence is almost, if not quite, conclusive
                  that primitive baptism was administered by immersion. Let us group these
                  circumstances, which we have examined, together. The primary meaning of the word
                  'baptize' is to immerse. Christ was baptized in Jordan; after being
                  baptized, he came up out of the water; John baptized at Enon, near to
                  Salem, because there was much water there; when Philip baptized the
                  eunuch, they went both of them down into the water, and after the
                  baptism, they came up out of the water; and Paul says we are
                     buried with Christ by baptism unto death; that as Christ was
                  raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
                  newness of life. And here again, in his Epistle to the Colossians, he says,
                  'Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him, through the faith
                  of the operation of God.' Buried by baptism; the burial is in the
                     ordinance, and in this also is the resurrection spoken of; for Paul is
                  explicit in saying, 'Ye are buried with Christ in baptism, wherein, i. e., in
                  which baptism ye also are risen with him.' The burial and the
                     resurrection are in the baptism, and these, whilst
                  they remind the believer of the burial and resurrection of Christ, as the grounds
                  of his Christian
                     pp. 257 and 258.
                  
                   hope, are, at the same time, beautifully
                  symbolic of the believer's death unto sin, and his resurrection to a new life. It
                  cannot be denied that Paul's language on these passages is in perfect harmony with
                  baptism by immersion, but it is entirely incongruous if the ordinance was
                  administered in any other way. Where is there any burial or resurrection in the
                  act of sprinkling or of pouring? There is none.
               "All these circumstances, whether considered singly or together—this baptizing
                  where there was much water—going down into the water—coming up out of the
                  water—being buried and raised again—were not only harmonious with, but were
                  absolutely necessary to, immersion, but not to any other mode. It is certainly
                  very strange that all these circumstantial incidents should have been mentioned,
                  if the ordinance did not require them; and it certainly would not have required
                  them if it had been administered by sprinkling or pouring."
               "Hark!" said Stephen; "did I not hear voices and footsteps by the door?"
               "I should think not," replied Strongfaith. "It is now midnight. The colonists are
                  in bed; probably not a family is awake, except where sickness exists." A slight
                  noise at the door, like that of persons stepping on the ground, caused him to pause. He then added, "You
                  may be correct, but if so, they are probably some sailors who have wandered from
                  their vessel, and on their return, have come this way to see whether the store was
                  open."
               "Perhaps our light shines through the crevices of the doors and shutters, and
                  attracts them."
               Stephen was correct. Pynchon and Endicott, who had been attending a conference at
                  the house of Parson Cotton, to deliberate upon the best measures to be adopted for
                  the suppression of heresy in the colony, and where, by the interest of the
                  subject, their conversation had been continued late into the night, were on their
                  way home. Seeing, through the chinks and crevices of Bates's store, a light, their
                  attention was arrested.
               "What does that mean?" said Endicott; "are thieves plundering Bates's store? He
                  usually closes the trucking house and goes home early."
               "It would not be surprising," said Pynchon, "if Bates himself were there, holding
                  converse with some of the suspected ones, or perhaps trying to
                  pervert to a baptistical use those passages of the Holy Scriptures to which I
                  found the leaves of his Bible turned down the other day."
               "He truly has selected an appropriate time for his deeds of darkness, if the case
                  is as you suppose."
               "It always has been so, brother; heretics love darkness rather than light, because
                  their deeds are evil. Being children of the night, and not of the day, they shrink
                  like owls and bats from the light."
               The two Puritans had now reached the store. To gratify their curiosity, they
                  paused at the door. Through one of the crevices, by means of which the light
                  within had been betrayed, they could see the employer and his clerk in earnest
                  conversation. It required no effort to hear what was said. The last words which we
                  have recorded as having been uttered by Strongfaith, they heard with perfect
                  distinctness.
               "What think you of that?" asked Endicott.
               "Think! It is just what I have supposed for some weeks," replied Pynchon.
               "Not satisfied with being infected by this loathsome leprosy himself, here he is,
                  like some foul wizard, laboring at midnight to bewitch this unsuspecting youth,
                  and infuse the contagion into his soul."
               His voice arrested the attention of Stephen, as has already been described. They
                     perceived that they were heard, and,
                  not wishing to be known, they hastily left the door, and pressed towards home.
                  When Stephen opened the door, and looked out into the darkness, he could see
                  nothing but the indistinct forms of two unknown men in the distance, who soon
                  disappeared entirely from view.
               The conversation having been in this manner interrupted, and the door being open,
                  Mr. Bates told Stephen he thought they had better close the store for the night,
                  and resume the conversation some other time.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               A STRANGE LETTER.
               THE language which Pynchon and Endicott had heard Bates employ whilst they were
                  standing by the door of the store, was sufficient to confirm their previous
                  suspicions of his sympathy with the Baptists, if not to convince them that he was
                  fully converted to their views. They informed Parson Cotton, and the prominent
                  members of the church, of what they had seen and heard. It soon became noised
                  abroad that Bates was a Baptist. On the Sabbath, and on lecture days, when he
                  attended meeting, especially when any allusions were made to the prevailing
                  heresies, or when children were brought to be christened, many a furtive glance
                  was cast towards his pew, to see what effect was produced upon him. If he closed
                  his eyes, or turned away his head, or accidentally coughed, it was construed into
                  strong evidence against him. It was not long before Strongfaith discovered the
                  feelings and suspicions of the Puritans towards him. He saw that he was an object of particular observation; that a
                  coolness was growing up in the minds of former friends towards him; that his
                  custom was falling off; and that the brethren of the church did not meet, as
                  formerly, for conversation at his store. He plainly perceived that he was losing
                  caste. This, however, did not deter him from prosecuting his inquiries upon the
                  general subject of baptism. Since his conversation with Chauncy, his mind had
                  become much clearer upon the mode. He saw that by translating the word baptize
                  "immerse," in all the instances of baptism recorded in the New Testament,
                  congruous and complete sense would be made; but if it were rendered "sprinkling,"
                  there was an incongruity. He frequently read those accounts, sometimes
                  substituting one of these words, and sometimes the other. "'The Saviour was
                  sprinkled in Jordan, and when he was sprinkled he came up straightway out of the
                  water.' I see no reason why he should have gone into the river for
                  that purpose. 'John was sprinkling in Enon, near to Salem, because there was much
                  water there; and they came and were sprinkled.' Surely much water was not required
                  for sprinkling; yet that is assigned as the reason for his selecting that place. I
                  know that others say that a place of much water was selected for the accommodation
                  of the camels, mules, &c., which came with the multitudes, and would require
                  much water. But that explanation does not seem to me satisfactory. Again: 'We are
                  buried with Christ by sprinkling into his death.' There is no burial in a slight
                  sprinkling. The language is incongruous. But if we read it, 'We are buried with
                  Christ by immersion,' that is consistent. There is always a burial in an
                  immersion. It seems to me that immersion is the idea intended by the word baptism,
                  and consequently that that was the mode adopted in primitive times." After a
                  careful examination of all the arguments on both sides of the question, he arrived
                  at the conclusion that immersion was essential to Christian baptism. lie then
                  turned his attention to the appropriate subjects of the ordinance. Whilst pursuing
                  his investigations upon this point, it fortunately happened that Ex-President
                  Dunster, who had retired to Scituate after his departure from Cambridge, visited
                  Boston. Strongfaith, after much contrivance, finally obtained a private interview
                  with him, and learned from him the reasons of his rejection of infant baptism.
                  Dunster was a clear and forcible reasoner. He could present a subject ject in a strong light. His
                  conversations with others upon the exciting topic of infant baptism had so shaken
                  their faith, and troubled their minds, that they attributed it to satanic
                  influence. At a time when he refused to have his own infant baptized, and came out
                  publicly, in a sermon, "against the administration of baptism to any infant
                  whatsoever," he was visited by Rev. Jonathan Mitchel, who was subsequently, if not
                  at that very time, the Puritan minister at Cambridge. Instead of convincing
                  Dunster that he was in error, he came near being convinced that he had embraced a
                  false doctrine himself, for in his account of the results of this interview,
                  Mitchel says, with a blending of simplicity and superstition, if not with a
                  mingling of bigotry, "After I came from him, I found hurrying and pressing
                  suggestions against pedo-baptism, and injected scruples and thoughts whether the
                  other way might not be right, and infant baptism an invention of men, and whether
                  I might with good conscience baptize children, and the like. And these thoughts
                  were darted in with some impression, and left a strange confusion and sickliness
                  upon my spirit. Yet methought it was not hard to discern that they were from
                     the EVIL ONE. First, because they were rather injected, hurrying
                  suggestions, than any deliberate thoughts, or bringing any light with them.
                  Secondly, because they were unreasonable, interrupting me in my study for the
                  Sabbath, and putting my spirit into confusion, so as I had much ado to do aught in
                  my sermon. * * * It was a check to my former self-confidence, and it made me
                  fearful to go needlessly to Mr. D., for methought I found a venom and poison in
                  his insinuations and discourses against pedo-baptism. I resolved, also, on Mr.
                  Hooker's principle, that I would have an argument able to remove a
                     mountain before I would recede from or appear against a truth or
                  practice received among the faithful."*
              
               
                  *This veritable letter Backus quotes from Mitchel's Life.
               
               It need excite no surprise that a man whose; powers of argument could produce
                  effects upon an educated minister, which the latter attributed to satanic agency,
                  should also have had considerable influence with Strongfaith. He presented such
                  objections against the practice of infant baptism, that Bates found himself unable
                  to reply to them. Not to render this account tedious to the reader, it must
                  suffice to say in brief, that both Bates and Stephen embraced the Baptist views of
                  the ordinance. Still they attended
                  meeting with the regular Congregational Church in Boston. Stephen, however, did
                  not make a public profession of religion, though in other respects he lived an
                  exemplary Christian life.
               One Sabbath, when Parson Cotton was administering what he called the seal of
                  covenant to one of the infants of the church, Strongfaith, to show his entire want
                  of sympathy with the service, turned his back to the pulpit. He wished it to be
                  understood that he had no faith in the authority or utility of the ordinance. He
                  felt it to be his duty to bear, in some manner, his public testimony against what
                  he now regarded as an unscriptural, human invention, and for this reason he
                  resolved to turn his back whenever the service might be performed. His conduct
                  created great excitement in the congregation.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               GRIZZLY BEAR.
               OUR narrative now requires us to return and inquire after the fortunes of the
                  missing girl. During the time that Priscilla was in that retired grove, at the
                  base of a high, precipitous rock, pouring out her confessions before God, and
                  earnestly-entreating for pardon, two pair of dark, brilliant eyes were peering
                  down upon her from above. Unknown to her, she had been the object of observation
                  to two tall, strong, savage Indians, some time before she reached her retired
                  bower of prayer. They cautiously followed her course. When she betook herself to
                  her place of concealment, they noiselessly crept to the top of the high rock, over
                  the edge of which, as they lay upon the ground, they could watch all her
                  movements.
               When she left this tabernacle to return home, they quietly descended from their
                  watchtower and pursued her. Not knowing that danger was near, she leisurely
                  retraced her steps, singing as she
                  went, when suddenly her steps were arrested by a heavy hand laid upon her
                  shoulder. She turned her head, and saw two half-naked savages behind her. She was
                  startled by the suddenness of the apparition, but not terrified. Having always
                  treated the Indians kindly, and conscious of possessing benevolent feelings
                  towards them, she could not think that these unexpected companions meditated
                  injury, or if they did, she thought she could dissuade them from their purpose.
                  Innocence lulls suspicion; benevolence inspires courage, especially towards those
                  for whom it is cherished. Priscilla did not shriek; she calmly asked them what
                  they wanted. The older of the two—who, in consequence of having slain,
                  single-handed, a grizzly bear, a huge claw of which he wore upon his breast, was
                  called after that animal—pointed to the woods, in a direction opposite to that in
                  which Priscilla was going.
               "No," said the unsuspicious girl; "the settlement is in the other direction. Come
                  with me, and I will lead you to it."
               She misunderstood them. They desired not to go there, but wanted her to accompany
                  them. The savage shook his head, pointed in the same direction again, turned
                  Priscilla with the strong hand which still rested upon her shoulder, and gave her
                  a rough push in the direction which he pointed.
               "What do you mean?" said the insulted girl, with earnestness, the blood mantling
                  her cheeks.
               She received no other reply than another rude shove.
               "Be off; and let me go home!"
               The Indian drew out a cord made of a dried skin. Priscilla now saw that she was in
                  danger. She attempted to run towards the settlement. Vain attempt! They seized
                  her, and prepared to tie her arms behind her. She commenced pleading and
                  entreating in a most pathetic manner to be released, but soon discovered that they
                  understood not a single word she uttered. She was a helpless captive, in the power
                  of two stalwart Indians! Escape was impossible. To arouse the settlement by her
                  shrieks and cries was equally impossible. She fully realized her perilous
                  condition; and when she thought that she might be led a slave in a distant
                  captivity, be subjected to most cruel treatment, and perhaps never see her friends
                  again, the prospect was too appalling; her natural fortitude gave way, and she
                  burst into tears.
               
               Having become somewhat acquainted with the Indian character from the narratives of
                  their adventures which she had heard from the colonists, and knowing her own
                  weakness, she considered it the most prudent policy to offer no violent
                  opposition, which she thought would be sure to excite their anger and increase
                  their cruelty. She allowed her arms to be tied behind her without resistance. She
                  was then led back to the pond, her bonnet was thrown in the water, and her basket
                  left upon the shore, to give the impression that she was drowned. She was then led
                  into the pond, and all three walked along the shore for a considerable distance,
                  with their feet covered by the water, so that their trail should not be
                  discovered.
               When Lightfoot, the Indian guide, had tracked Priscilla to the pond, and conducted
                  her father there, his practised eye saw that she had not been alone. Imperfect
                  prints of human feet, which neither of the Eatons saw, convinced him that she had
                  been taken a prisoner. But, as his opinion of her destiny was not asked, he, with
                  Indian taciturnity, withheld it. He was the more disposed to remain silent, lest a
                  disclosure of the truth might arouse all the warlike elements of the whites, and
                  stimulate them to engage in a bloody crusade against the natives, in which he and
                  his tribe, though entirely innocent, might suffer indiscriminately with the
                  guilty. Besides, he thought that possibly he might, in his intercourse with
                  neighboring tribes, obtain some trace of her, and perhaps discover the place of
                  her captivity, for the disclosure of which to the colonists, he would receive a
                  handsome reward, and be treated with as much distinction as though he were a great
                  sagamore. Cupidity and the love of distinction are as natural to savage as to
                  civilized men.
               To return to Priscilla. After her captors had led her about a mile in the water
                  along the shore, they reached a place where there was an opening in the woods. At
                  this point they left the pond, and entered the open country through this gap. To
                  have attempted it at any other point, they would have had to break their way
                  through the thick underbrush, and thus leave a distinctly-marked trail, which
                  could not fail to indicate to the pursuers the course they had taken. They pressed
                  on rapidly, avoiding, as much as possible, the hills, and following the valleys
                  and low land, so as to escape observation. Whenever they came to a brook, they
                  entered it; and sometimes they crossed
                  directly over, leaving their footprints distinctly visible on the opposite shore,
                  after which they would carefully reënter the stream, and follow its channel until
                  they reached some place where they could leave it without the probability of
                  detection. At other times they walked along some distance by the side of the
                  stream, designedly leaving a clearly-defined trail behind them, and then entered
                  it in the direction which they had been pursuing; but after proceeding a short
                  distance in the water, they retraced their steps, and followed the bed of the
                  stream a long way in the opposite direction. The object of these manœuvres was to
                  deceive their pursuers, if they should have any, and put them on a false
                  track.
               Priscilla, with her hands tied behind her, was driven the most of the way before
                  these demons. Any attempt to pause, or to make the least noise, was followed with
                  a heavy blow from one or both of her drivers, accompanied by such threatening
                  gesticulations and frightful expressions of countenance as effectually prevented a
                  repetition of the attempt, except when the poor captive was almost driven to
                  despair. Having eaten and drank nothing since she left her uncle's in the morning,
                  and being driven at a rapid rate all the day, without one moment's rest, with her
                  arms tightly bound behind her, she became so exhausted as, towards the latter part
                  of the afternoon, to stagger from side to side, like a person intoxicated. Still
                  no compassion was awakened in the breasts of her captors. They would now and then
                  take her by the arm when they came to a rough place, or when ascending an
                  eminence, and assist her, but would not allow her to pause a single moment.
               Poor girl! She endeavored to strengthen her heart by reflections upon the
                  providence of God. A little sparrow hopping upon the grass reminded her of the
                  sentiment of the Saviour, that even such diminutive, unimportant creatures could
                  not be injured without her heavenly Father's permission; and so impressively did
                  the language of her Saviour recur to her memory, that it seemed almost as if a
                  voice in the air said, "Ye are of more value than many sparrows." "My Father knows
                  my condition. He, in his mysterious providence, has placed me here; why, then,
                  should I murmur?" Such were her thoughts. She raised her tear-wet eyes to Heaven,
                  and audibly said,—
               "Thy will, O God, be done."
               A blow from the hand of Grizzly Bear silenced her, and laid her insensible upon
                  the ground.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XL.
               A PAINFUL JOURNEY.
               FINDING her unable to move, the two Indians seized her, lifted her up, and hurried
                  on as rapidly as their load would allow. When Priscilla came to, it was night. How
                  far she had been carried, or in what direction, she knew not. She was lying upon
                  the grass. The stars were looking down upon her from the clear, serene heavens,
                  and trembling as if in sympathy for her fate. The shrill, intermittent, grating
                  notes of the cricket, the sounds of other insects, and the dismal hooting of the
                  owl, combined with the noise of the wind as it rustled the leaves and swayed the
                  branches of the trees, made mournful music in the ear of the stolen girl. Near her
                  were the two Indians. Grizzly Bear was sitting at her feet, with his dark,
                  piercing eyes fixed intently upon her. The other, whose name, when translated,
                  signified Gray Eagle, because, perhaps, on some occasion, he had slain that bird,
                  was prostrate upon the earth, sound asleep.
               Priscilla now began to suffer extremely. Her fasting for so many hours, her great
                  fatigue, and her constrained posture, arising from the binding of her arms behind
                  her, became almost insupportable. The flesh of her arms was swollen and tender.
                  Darting pains shot through her shoulders and breast, as though she was pierced
                  with hot needles. Her lips and tongue were parched and cracked. Her blood coursed
                  its way through her veins as though it were molten lead, and, so sensitive had she
                  become, that the throbbing occasioned by the pulsations of the heart could be felt
                  throughout her whole system. All attempts to disengage her hands, only served to
                  increase her sufferings. To these was added her mental agony. She thought of the
                  colony—of the excitement which her mysterious disappearance must have caused. She
                  thought of her uncle, and of the good pastor who had been so faithful in his
                  spiritual labors for her welfare; but with deeper interest did she dwell upon the
                  bitter agony of her father. When she thought of their long separation, of the
                  providential manner in which she was thrown into the family of her uncle, and thus
                  got trace of her parents—when she reflected upon the delightful change of feeling
                  which she had experienced rienced in
                  the secluded grove, and upon the delight which her dear father would have
                  experienced to see her, and from her own lips hear the narrative of her
                  conversion; and, above all, when she pictured before her imagination the agony of
                  her father upon his arrival at New Haven—his bitter disappointment, the sudden
                  transition of his feelings from joy to sorrow,—her emotions became insupportable;
                  she burst into a flood of tears. She longed to cry aloud to God, but a
                  recollection of the last blow which she had received from her ruthless captors
                  prevented.
               Whilst lying with one cheek upon the damp grass, and the other turned up,
                  furnishing an attractive field for the bloodthirsty mosquitos which lit upon and
                  pierced it with impunity, her thoughts wandered to Stephen. She pictured him
                  before her mind as when she last saw him. "O that he knew my condition! O that he
                  would prove himself my deliverer! Dear, dear Stephen, whatever becomes of me, may
                  the blessing of Heaven ever follow thee."
               The Indians now changed guard. Grizzly Bear roused Gray Eagle, and then threw
                  himself upon the ground. In a few moments he was in a sound sleep. In the course
                  of a couple of hours they recommenced their journey.
               When Priscilla arose, she found her feet were so swollen and tender, that she
                  could scarcely stand. When her unfeeling captors ordered her to march, she made
                  the attempt, but finding it so painful, she paused and pointed to her swollen and
                  bleeding feet, as her excuse. This appeal to the sympathy of her drivers was met
                  only by a violent shove, which almost threw her to the earth. It was past midnight
                  when the journey was recommenced. The moon and nearly all the stars were obscured
                  by the clouds, rendering it impossible to see but a short distance. To prevent the
                  captive from taking advantage of the darkness in an attempt to escape, the savages
                  alternately held her by the arm, so that she was constantly in the grasp of one or
                  the other.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLI.
               THREE STRANGERS.
               ONE Saturday, in the month of July, three strangers, who had journeyed far, and
                  were weary, hungry, and thirsty, arrived at Boston.
               "Well pleased am I," said one, whose name was Clark, "that Christian people dwell
                  here, although in some points they differ from us."
               "Yes," replied one of his companions, who wore a brown coat with long and broad
                  skirts, and great pockets opening on the outside, "yes, this is one of the cities
                  of Zion, and yonder I see their sanctuary," at the same time pointing to the
                  meeting house.
               "No doubt, then, brother Holmes, the people will remember the words of the Saviour
                  about a cup of cold water given to a disciple, for I feel as if a draught at this
                  time would be exceedingly refreshing."
               "I sympathize with you in that feeling, brother Crandall," said the first speaker,
                  "and I never saw the force of that passage of Solomon as I do now—'As cold waters
                  to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.' It seems to me I never
                  longed for a good drink as I do at this moment."
               "With me," said Holmes, "it is not so much thirst as hunger."
               "Well, well, cheer up, brethren, for these Christian friends are doubtless given
                  to hospitality, and will readily relieve our wants. And if not, we can go to the
                  tavern, and pay for meals and a lodging, though we abound not in filthy
                  lucre."
               They now reached a house standing by itself on the outskirts of the town. As they
                  approached it, they noticed that a woman closed the door, as if to signify that
                  their approach was unwelcome.
               "Perhaps," said Crandall, "she thinks we are thieves, or pirates, and that she
                  would not be safe in our company."
               "A word of explanation will remove her error."
               They soon reached the house and knocked at the door; but no one opened it. They
                  knocked again, louder than at first.
               "Ye had better go long," said the shrill, cracked voice of an old woman on the
                  inside.
               "We are wayfaring strangers," said Mr. Clark, "faint and hungry, who wish merely
                     to rest for a few moments, and
                  obtain some refreshments."
               "Ye must go then to the magistrates," replied the shrill feminine voice, "for I
                  have no license."
               "License! license! What does she mean by that?"
               "We are not acquainted with your magistrates," said Clark, speaking through the
                  door.
               "And we hope we never may be officially," added Crandall, in an undertone, which
                  could be heard only by his companions, who smiled at the remark. "And we know not
                  what you mean by a license," continued Clark.
               The shrill, cracked voice now came from the window. It proved to be that of the
                  short, crooked-back, loquacious Mrs. Strangger. Putting her head out of the
                  window, she said,—
               "Why, la, didn't you know that the Gineral Court had passed a law that nobody
                  should entertain strangers without a partickler license from two magistrates?*
                   Gracious, I thought every body knew that, for it has made talk enough.
                  Why, no longer ago than yesterday, one of our godly elders refused to receive a
                  trader, although he had every reason to believe him a good man—jist because he had
                  no license, and said the laws must be obeyed."
               
                  *Hubbard's New England, p. 413, edition of 1815. Benedict's Hist., p.
                     371.
               
               "Well, can thee not furnish us a little bread and water?"
               "If ye can make it appear that that is not entertaining strangers, I can," replied
                  the prudent little lady.
               "Do ye not remember what is said about entertaining strangers unawares?"
               "I would do it, with pleasure, if I only had a license. Our magistrates are so
                  afraid of entertaining Anabaptists, Familists, and other heretics, unawares, that
                  they have passed this law for our protection."
               The three strangers looked at each other with a singular but significant
                  expression of countenance.
               "Go ye, and get a permit from the magistrates, and I will give ye the best my poor
                  house affords."
               Mrs. Strangger would gladly have admitted them for the pleasure of having some one
                  hear her talk, and for the opportunity which their visit would have afforded of
                  picking up some new items which she could have converted into materials for
                  gossip. But she knew that she was already a suspected person, and she
                     feared to increase these suspicions.
                  Seeing, just at this moment, one of the colonists in the distance, coming along
                  the road towards them, she said to the strangers, in a hurried manner, and in
                  tones indicative of fear,—
               "If ye would not get a poor, lone woman into trouble, ye had better go 'long. Here
                  are witnesses at hand, and it might go hard with me if I let ye in my house."
               They felt the force of this appeal, and moved on.
               "Strange place this," said Crandall, "where a stranger cannot have given him a
                  crust of bread, nor a cup of water without the permission of two magistrates."
               "If the magistrates happen to be absent when strangers arrive, I suppose they must
                  fast, and sleep out doors until the magistrates return, and, in their great
                  kindness, license some one to perform the first acts of hospitality."
               "In our case," said Clark, "it is probable that no license would be given. If that
                  timid old woman assigned the true reason of this law, it was designed as an
                  embargo upon such as we. No one could get a license to entertain us without
                  telling who and what we were; and to reveal that would be fatal to their
                  application. They would be forbidden to harbor us."
               "Our prospects are not the most flattering. But here comes a person who may
                  perhaps help us."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLII.
               A SINGULAR INVITATION.
               THE individual referred to at the close of the last chapter was no other than the
                  brother of the mill, whom the old lady had seen in the distance, and who had now
                  reached the travellers. They accosted him, told him they were strangers, and asked
                  him where they could receive hospitality.
               "As to that, our rulers are very jealous lest hospitality should be extended to
                  unsuitable persons, and therefore require the license of the magistrates to
                  authorize the virtue. But if ye will go with me, I will show you where there is a
                  house which no one will prevent you from entering, and where there is food which
                  no one will forbid your eating. If ye understand, follow me."
               There was something so original, hearty, and frank in this invitation, that they
                  accepted it. They did understand, and were resolved not to compromise the stranger
                  for his kindness. During the walk to the house, the conversation assumed such a
                  character that the parties found that they were in sympathy with each other in
                  their religious views. The walk was not long. When they reached the threshold, the
                  brother said,—
               "This is my house. I will neither invite ye in nor forbid ye to enter; ye may do
                  as ye please; but as ye have commenced following me, ye will probably continue."
                  They understood, and followed him in.
               When the dinner was ready, he said, at the same time preventing, with difficulty,
                  the smiles from playing upon his countenance,—
               "Here is food. I will neither ask ye to taste it nor prohibit ye from eating it;
                  ye may do as ye please; but hungry men, with a meal before them, are never at a
                  loss." They understood again, and were soon at work discussing, with a relish
                  which keen hunger alone can give, the plain, but healthful diet before them. It is
                  scarcely necessary to intimate to the reader that the object of this caution on
                  the part of Eaton was to throw the whole responsibility of their proceeding upon
                  the three men themselves, so that he might avoid the liability of a conviction
                  under this arbitrary law.
               During the conversation that ensued, the trio of travellers understood that the
                     colony was agitated upon the subject
                  of baptism; the ministers and rulers were exceedingly fearful of Baptist
                  sentiments, and were vigilant in discovering and severe in treating all of that
                  sect.
               Leaving this hospitable family, they prosecuted their journey towards Lynn, where
                  they arrived in the latter part of the afternoon.
               At a distance of two or three miles from the main village stood a small house,
                  partly built of logs, in which resided an old man by the name of William Witter.
                  He was a member of the Baptist church which had been gathered at Newport. In
                  consequence of his age, he was unable to meet with his brethren at Newport, and
                  therefore had requested his church to send some of its members to visit him. His
                  request was complied with, and John Clark, Obadiah Holmes, and Crandall were
                  appointed to that service. Clark and Holmes were both Baptist ministers. Clark was
                  the pastor of the church. Subsequently, Holmes became his successor in that
                  office.
               Whether these representatives of the Newport church attracted attention and
                  awakened suspicion by inquiring where Witter lived, or whether this brother had
                  given notice that he was expecting some of his church to see him, it is difficult
                  now to tell; but certain it is, the magistrates were alarmed, and ordered the
                  constable to be on the alert for the apprehension of any suspicious persons. The
                  travellers found Witter's house, and received a cordial greeting. The old man was
                  overjoyed to see them. He little thought of the protracted and painful trials
                  which this fraternal visit would occasion. Both parties had so much to say that
                  conversation was continued until late in the night.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLIII.
               RESULTS OF A MEETING.
               THE next day being the Sabbath, and the meeting house being at so great a
                  distance, it was proposed that they should have worship where they were, and that
                  Mr. Clark should preach. Father Witter would thus have an opportunity of listening
                  to his own pastor, whom he had not been privileged to hear for a long time.
               Accordingly, in that rough-built, solitary private house, social religious
                  services were observed. After the offering of praise and prayer, Mr. Clark
                  announced his text. Believing, from his own experience, and from the indications
                  of the times, that a period of unusual temptation and trial was about to befall
                  the people of God, he had selected, as an appropriate passage from which to
                  discourse, Rev. 3rd chapter and 10th verse—"Because thou hast kept the word of my
                  patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon
                  all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth." During the delivery of his
                  introduction, four or five strangers unexpectedly came in, and quietly took seats
                  with the little domestic congregation. Having finished his introduction, Mr. Clark
                  said, "In opening this interesting passage of holy writ for your serious
                  meditation, I shall in the first place show what is meant by the hour of
                  temptation—secondly, what we are to understand by the word of his patience, with
                  the character of those who keep it—and thirdly, the soul-cheering encouragement
                  which is furnished by the promise that those who keep this word shall themselves
                  be kept in the hour of temptation and trial."
               He proceeded in his discourse with increasing earnestness, the little audience, in
                  the mean while, giving the closest attention. Father Witter, sitting in an old,
                  high-back arm chair, in one corner of the room, was listening with tearful eyes
                  and open mouth, as though he had not heard the true doctrine for many months. It
                  was to him a great luxury to hear his own pastor, in his own house, treat so
                  appropriate and comforting a subject as the one he had announced. Alas! the
                  sweetness of the occasion was soon converted into gall. These unknown, harmless
                  strangers, observing Sabbath bath
                  worship in a remote part of the town, for the especial comfort of one of their
                  aged brethren, had (as we have intimated) attracted the attention of the
                  magistrates, and were destined to furnish, in their painful experience, an
                  illustration of the truth of the text. During the progress of the discourse, two
                  constables entered the room.
               "What does this mean?" said the first. "Why hold this unlawful assembly? Is not
                  the meeting house good enough, nor the doctrines preached there pure enough for
                  ye, that ye must hold a gathering of your own, to the scandal and injury of the
                  place?"
               Mr. Clark paused in his discourse. The little audience turned their eyes with
                  surprise and grief upon the disturber.
               "Ye have no business here," said the second. "Ye must disperse, or take the
                  consequences; and they'll not be pleasant, I tell ye."
               "We do not intend, friends," said Mr. Clark, calmly, "to break any good and
                  wholesome laws of the land."
               "No parleying," replied the first. "Come, shut up your book, and go with us; we
                  have come to apprehend you."
               "Apprehend us!" replied Clark, with astonishment; "we wish to know by whose
                  authority. We should like to see your warrant."
               "We come with authority from the magistrates; and as to our warrant, I will read
                  it."
               He then drew forth a document, and read as follows:— 
                     
                        
                           
                              "By virtue hereof, you are required to go to the house of William
                                 Witter, and so to search from house to house for certain erroneous
                                 persons, being strangers, and them to apprehend, and in safe
                                 custody to keep, to-morrow morning, by eight o'clock, to bring
                                 before me.
                              
                                 ROBERT BRIDGES."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     *
                     
                  
               
               
                  *In our account of the treatment of the Baptists by the civil government
                     of Massachusetts, we have followed the statements of Clark, Holmes,
                     Backus, and Benedict.
               
               During the reading of this precious paper, the hand of the constable trembled, as
                  though he were conscious he was engaged in a bad cause. After he had finished, Mr.
                  Clark said,—
               "It is not our intention to resist the authority by which you have come to
                  apprehend us, but yet I perceive you are not so strictly tied but if you please
                  you may suffer us to make an end of what we have begun; so may you be witnesses
                  either to or against the faith and order which we hold."
               "We can do no such thing."
               "You may," repeated Clark, "in spite of the warrant, or any thing therein
                  contained."
               
               After as much uncivil disturbance and clamor as the pursuivants of the English
                  bishops, under Claude, indulged in when they arrested the Puritans, and broke up
                  their Conventicles in England, the two constables apprehended the two ministers,
                  Clark and Holmes, with their brother Crandall, and led them away. There being no
                  jail or other place of confinement in Lynn, the three prisoners were taken
                     to the alehouse. It was a deeply affecting scene to old Father
                  Witter to see his beloved pastor and brethren taken from his own house, prisoners,
                  for no other offence than worshipping God according to the dictates of their own
                  consciences. A recollection of the fact that they had visited him (and had thus
                  been caught in the snare) by his own invitation, added to his sorrow. As the three
                  prisoners left the house, the pastor said to the venerable man,—
               "The hour of temptation and trial has come, but let us keep the word of his
                  patience, and He will sustain us in the time of trouble."
               At the tavern, whilst at dinner, one of the constables said,—
               "Gentlemen, if you be free, I will carry you to the meeting." To which they
                  replied,—
               "Friend, had we been free thereunto, we had prevented all this. Nevertheless, we
                  are in thy hand, and if thou wilt carry us to meeting, thither will we go."
               "Then I will carry you to the meeting." To which the prisoners replied,—
               "If thou forcest us into your assembly, then shall we be constrained to declare
                  ourselves that we cannot hold communion with them."
               "That is nothing," said the constable. "I have not power to command you to speak
                  when you come there, or to be silent."
               Seeing the determination of the officers to take them to the meeting of those
                  whose principles and practices they disapproved, Mr. Clark repeated the course of
                  conduct which they should feel themselves compelled to pursue.
               "Since we have heard the word of salvation by Jesus Christ, we have been taught,
                  as those that first trusted in Christ, to be obedient unto him, both by word and
                  deed; wherefore, if we be forced to your meeting, we shall declare
                  our dissent from you, both by word and gesture."
               From this frank disclosure, the magistrates knew what to expect. They saw that if
                  they took these strangers to meeting, it must be by compulsion. The prisoners
                  would not go willingly to a meeting of those from whose principles of state-and-church government they so
                  widely differed; they saw, moreover, that if they compelled them to go, a
                  disturbance would be the consequence. The prisoners forewarned them that they
                  should feel constrained, from a sense of duty, to express publicly their dissent,
                  and the constables knew that this would at once kindle a conflagration. For a
                  moment they hesitated; but after consultation with the tavern-keeper, they decided
                  to take them.
               The three men, whose own worship had been broken up, were now taken, without their
                  own consent, to the meeting of the standing order. The congregation
                  were at prayers when they arrived. As they stepped over the threshold, they raised
                  their hats, and civilly saluted them. A seat was then assigned them, which they
                  occupied. After they had taken their seat, they put on their hats. Mr. Clark
                  opened his book, and commenced reading to himself. Mr. Bridges, who had made out
                  the warrant for their apprehension, seeing them sitting with their heads covered,
                  became excited, and ordered the constable to remove their hats from their heads,
                  who at once obeyed, but not in the most amiable manner.
               After the prayers, singing, and preaching were over, to which the prisoners
                  listened without offering the least interruption, Mr. Clark rose, and, in a
                  respectful manner, said,—
               "I desire, as a stranger, to propose a few things to this congregation, hoping, in
                  the proposal thereof, I shall commend myself to your consciences, to be guided by
                  that wisdom that is from above, which, being pure, is also peaceable, gentle, and
                  easy to be entreated." He paused, expecting, as be subsequently said, that if the
                  Prince of Peace had been among them, he would have received from them a peaceable
                  answer. But the pastor, probably fearing that some difficult questions might be
                  asked, and a troublesome theological controversy ensue, replied,—
               "We will have no objections against the sermon."
               "I am not about to present objections to the sermon," answered Mr. Clark, "but as,
                  by my gesture at my coming into your assembly, I declared my dissent from you, so,
                  lest that should prove offensive unto some whom I would not offend, I would now,
                  by word of mouth, declare the grounds, which are these: First—from the
                  consideration we are strangers, each to other, and so strangers to each other's
                  inward standing with respect to God, and so
                  cannot conjoin, and act in faith, and what is not of faith is sin; and in the
                  second place, I could not judge that you are gathered together and walk according
                  to the visible order of our Lord—"
               "Have done!" cried Mr. Bridges, with the authority of a magistrate. "You have
                  spoken that for which you must answer. I command silence."
               After the meeting, the trio of prisoners were taken back to the tavern, where they
                  were as vigilantly watched during the night as though they had been guilty of
                  robbery.
               The next morning they were taken by the constables before Mr. Bridges, who made
                  out their mittimus, and sent them to the prison at Boston, there to remain until
                  the next County Court.
               This mittimus charged them with "being at a private meeting in Lynn on the Lord's
                  day, exercising among themselves—offensively disturbing the peace of the
                  congregation at the time of their coming into the public meeting in the time of
                  prayer in the afternoon, with saying and manifesting that the church in Lynn was
                  not constituted according to the order of our Lord, with suspicion of
                  having their hands in rebaptizing one or more among
                  
                     pp. 301 and 302.
                   them, and with re-fusing to put in sufficient security to appear at the
                  County Court."
               In addition to these charges, it was alleged against Mr. Clark that he met again
                  the next day after his contempt, as they called it, of their public worship, at
                  the house of Witter, and in contempt of authority, being then in the custody of
                  the law, did there administer the sacrament Of the Lord's supper to one
                  excommunicated person, to another under admonition, and to a third that was an
                  inhabitant of Lynn, and not in fellowship with any church; and yet, upon answer in
                  open court, did affirm that he never rebaptized any.
               They were all three found guilty. Mr. Clark, the pastor, was fined twenty pounds,
                  equivalent to about eighty dollars, or to be well whipped. He desired to know by
                  what law of God or man he was condemned. The governor, who did not deem it beneath
                  his dignity to be present on this important occasion, stepped up, and, with much
                  earnestness, said to Mr. Clark, "You have denied infants baptism. You
                     deserve death. I will not have such trash brought into my jurisdiction.
                  You go up and down, and secretly insinuate unto those that are weak, but you
                  cannot maintain it before our ministers. You may try and dispute pute with them." To this
                  violent harangue of the chief magistrate of the colony Mr. Clark would have
                  replied at length, but the governor commanded the jailer to take the prisoners
                  away. They were accordingly all three remanded to prison.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIV.
               A CHALLENGE.
               DURING his confinement that night, Mr. Clark thought much of the insinuations
                  which had been thrown out against him by the governor the day before, and
                  especially of the challenge which had been given him to discuss the question of
                  baptism. It seemed to him as if the great Head of the church had placed him in
                  that position that there he might be a defender of the truth. He looked upon it as
                  a most favorable opportunity to remove the various aspersions which had been
                  unjustly cast upon the Baptists, and show that in doctrine and practice they were
                  true Christian men. By speaking in behalf of his brethren, it appeared to him that
                  he might possibly be the instrument of removing the unjust disabilities to which
                  they were subject, but especially that he might, by presenting the arguments for
                  their peculiar belief, and their objections to infant sprinkling, be the means of
                  opening the eyes of others, and convincing them of the truth. Yet when he thought of his own
                  inability to do full justice to the subject, and of the disadvantages under which
                  he would labor in having the ministry of the standing order and the government
                  arrayed against him, his heart sunk within him. "But will not the Saviour be with
                  me? Have I not faith to believe that, according to his own promise, it will be
                  given me in that same hour what I ought to speak?" The taunting permit of the
                  governor, "You may try and dispute with the ministers," was constantly ringing in
                  his ears. He offered earnest prayer for direction and assistance, and finally
                  resolved that, by the grace of God, he would accept the governor's challenge. He
                  did not, as a Christian minister, dare to refuse.
               Accordingly, the next morning he addressed a document to the court which had
                  condemned him, accepting the governor's proffer of a public discussion of the
                  points at issue between the Congregationalists and the Baptists, and asking the
                  appointment of a time and place for the occasion. This threw the court into a
                  peculiar position. A prisoner, who had been condemned and sentenced mainly for his
                  religious views and practices, but to whom the governor had thrown down the
                  gauntlet for a discussion, had accepted the challenge. For the court to refuse its
                  sanction would be a tacit rebuke of the governor, and a silent admission of the
                  weakness, or their fear of the weakness, of their cause.
               After much ado, therefore, Mr. Clark was informed by one of the magistrates that
                  the disputation was granted, and the time fixed for it was the next week. When
                  this became known to the ministers of the colony, it created great excitement
                  among them. They disapproved the arrangement. They had no wish to enter upon the
                  discussion; they desired to have it abandoned. They therefore saw the government,
                  and earnestly besought them to avoid it; but it seemed too late. They had gone too
                  far to make an honorable retreat. But finding the ministers so averse to a
                  disputation, the magistrates had Mr. Clark brought into their chamber, and there
                  endeavored to change the issues between him and them. They inquired whether he
                  would dispute upon the things contained in his sentence, and maintain his
                  practice; "for," said they, "the court sentenced you not for your judgment and
                  conscience, but for matter of fact and practice." But Mr. Clark was not to be
                  misled by any partial or erroneous statements of the matter; neither was he
                     willing that such statements should
                  go unrebutted. He therefore manfully replied to these magistrates,—
               "You say the court condemned me for matter of fact and practice; be it so. I say
                  the matter of fact and practice was but the manifestation of my judgment and
                  conscience, and I maintain that that man is void of judgment and conscience who
                  hath not a fact and practice which correspond therewith." He then continued, "If
                  the faith and order which I profess is according to the word of God, then the
                  faith and order which you profess must fall to the ground; but if your views of
                  truth and duty are scriptural, mine must be erroneous. We cannot both be right."
                  To these statements the magistrates apparently assented.
               Although Mr. Clark had been informed that the disputation had been granted, and
                  the time appointed, yet it was all informal and unofficial. He
                  desired to obtain an official permit, or order, for the discussion, under the
                  secretary's hand. He would then, he felt, be protected; otherwise, the debate
                  might be referred to as evidence of his being a disturber of the state, and a
                  troubler of Israel. He therefore availed himself of the opportunity which was
                  furnished by this private interview with the magistrates, to say to them that if
                  they would be pleased to grant the motion for the public disputation under
                     the secretary's hand, he would draw up three or four propositions,
                  embracing the points which he presented in his defence before the court, and would
                  defend them against any one whom they might choose to dispute with him, until, by
                  arguments derived from the word of God, he should be removed from them.
               "In case your speaker convinces me that I am in error," said Mr. Clark, following
                  up the subject so as to reach some definite practical point, "then the disputation
                  is at an end; but if not, then I desire the like liberty, by the word of God, to
                  oppose the faith and order which he and you profess, thereby to try whether I may
                  not become an instrument in the hand of God to remove you from the same."
               To this the magistrates replied,—
               "The motion certainly is fair, and your terms like unto a practised disputant;
                  but, as the matter in dispute is exceeding weighty, and as we desire that in the
                  controversy all may be said that can be, we propose, therefore, to postpone it to
                  a later day."
               Poor Clark was therefore taken back to prison, to wait for the arrival of this
                  "later day."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLV.
               FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS.
               DURING this period of delay for the accommodation of the Congregational clergy,
                  Clark, though kept a prisoner, was not idle. He applied himself to the proposed
                  service of drawing up the propositions which he had pledged himself to the
                  magistrates to defend. These propositions, or theses, were four in number. The
                  first asserted that Jesus Christ, the anointed one, was the great Head of his
                  church; that as the anointed Priest, he alone had made atonement for sin—as the
                  anointed Prophet, his teachings were authoritative; that as the anointed King, he
                  had gone to his Father for his glorious kingdom, and would ere long return again;
                  and that it is his prerogative alone to make laws and ordinances for
                  the observance of the church, which no one has any right to
                  alter.
               The second asserted that baptism, or immersion in water, is one of the
                  commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that the only proper person to receive
                  this ordinance is the penitent believer in Christ.
               The third maintained that it was both the privilege and duty of every such
                  believer to improve the talents which God hath given him, and in the congregation,
                  may either ask for information to himself, or may speak "for the edification,
                  exhortation, and comfort of the whole; and out of the congregation, at all times,
                  upon all occasions, and in all places, he ought to walk as a child of light,
                  justifying wisdom with his ways, and reproving folly with the unfruitful works
                  thereof, provided all this be shown out of a good conversation, as James speaks,
                  with meekness of wisdom."
               The fourth was in the following language: "I testify that no such believer or
                  servant of Christ Jesus hath liberty, much less authority, from his Lord, to smite
                  his fellow-servant, nor yet, with outward force, or arm of flesh, to constrain or
                  restrain his conscience—no, nor yet his outward man for conscience sake, or
                  worship of his God, where injury is not offered to the person, name, or estate of
                  others, every man being such as shall appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
                  and must give account of himself to God, and therefore ought to be fully persuaded
                  in his own mind for what he undertakes,
                  because he that doubteth is damned if he eat, and so also if he act, because he
                  doth not eat or act in faith; and what is not of faith is sin."
               These points Clark resolved, in the strength of Christ, to defend with all his
                  ability.
               The next day, as the first rays of the morning sun were gilding the hill tops, and
                  drinking the early dew, one of the magistrates of Boston visited the prison.
                  Having aroused the jailer, he asked to be admitted to an interview with Clark.
                  After being introduced to the cell of the imprisoned Baptist, he inquired if the
                  conclusions which he intended to advocate were drawn up. Mr. Clark informed him
                  that they were. He asked for a copy of them. Mr. Clark demurred. No official
                  sanction had yet been given to the anticipated controversy, and he was unwilling
                  that his conclusions or propositions should be known until that point had been
                  gained. The magistrate urged him with much importunity to part with a copy of
                  them; but he refused until the promise was given him that the motion for the
                  disputation should be granted officially, under the secretary's hand.
                  He then complied with the urgent request of his early visitor. Whilst Mr. Clark
                  was expecting this official permit, and was preparing for the public discussion by
                  the diligent study of the Bible, he was greatly surprised by being informed by the
                  jailer that the order for his release from prison had come.
               Some friends had, without his consent, and contrary to his judgment, paid his
                  fine, and secured his discharge.
               As it was generally known that a public disputation was at hand, in which the
                  points of difference between the Congregationalists and Baptists were to be
                  discussed, as rumor said, between Mr. Clark on one side and Mr. Cotton on the
                  other, great expectations had been raised as to the result. Clark, being fully
                  convinced that if this disputation did not come off, the responsibility of the
                  failure would be attributed to him, and inferences be drawn unfavorable to his
                  side, as if his brethren feared the results of the discussion, and therefore paid
                  his fine, so that he might return to Newport, and thus not be on hand for the
                  controversy, immediately prepared an address, in which he stated that if the
                  honored magistrates or General Court of the colony would grant his former request,
                  under the secretary's hand, for the disputation, he would cheerfully embrace it,
                  and would come from Newport to defend the opinions he had professed. Having in
                  this manner evinced a willingness to
                  meet his opponents at any time they might appoint, he threw the whole
                  responsibility of the failure, in case there should be any, upon them. By so
                  doing, he maintained his own manliness, and gave public evidence that neither he
                  nor his friends had any fear of exposing their principles to the closest
                  scrutiny.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVI.
               POWER OF AN AMULET.
               BUT we must not lose sight of the unfortunate captive. We left Priscilla in the
                  power of two stalwart savages, who were leading her far away from her friends, and
                  who, to prevent her escape in the darkness of the night, alternately seized her
                  arm, so that she was constantly in the grasp of one or the other of them.
               As the first gray streaks of the morning began to show themselves in the east,
                  they came to a clear, cool, running brook. They here made a halt. As they were now
                  so far from the settlement, they did not fear any successful attempt, on the part
                  of their prisoner, to effect an escape.
               They therefore concluded to unbind her arms. As Grizzly Bear went behind her for
                  this purpose, his attention was suddenly arrested by a small object which he had
                  not seen before; and by the utterance of the Indian guttural syllable "Ugh," he
                  expressed his surprise prise to his
                  comrade. Gray Eagle was by his side instantly. During their examination of the
                  newly-discovered article, the fears of Priscilla were highly excited. Being
                  equally ignorant of the object of their scrutiny and of their motives, she was
                  apprehensive that they were planning some great indignity or cruelty towards her.
                  She listened carefully to their low conversation, and, though she understood not a
                  sentence, yet there was one word which they occasionally uttered, that she had
                  heard before, that revealed to her the object of their curiosity, and awakened in
                  her despairing heart a gleam of hope. That word was "Omao," the name of the Indian
                  whom Priscilla had sheltered and fed in her uncle's house. The little skin pouch,
                  connected with the rude representation of a frog, which that Indian gave her as a
                  testimony of his gratitude, she always carried with her when she went into the
                  fields. She had the impression that it was something which the Indians highly
                  valued, and that, if in her wandering she should accidentally meet any of them, by
                  showing it she would conciliate their favor, and avoid ill treatment. When seized
                  and bound by her captors, this pouch was suspended from her neck, but concealed
                  beneath her dress. They therefore did not see it. In her excitement, it did not
                  occur to her to take it from her bosom and show it. What a pity! The disclosure of
                  that bag would have secured her instant release, and prevented her from enduring
                  these painful marches, and a dreadful captivity. She would have returned to her
                  uncle's—have found her father—and the experience of her life, for years, would
                  have been totally changed.
               While she was lying upon the grass, this mysterious pouch changed its position,
                  and worked around to her back. When Grizzly Bear commenced loosening the skin
                  cords with which she was bound, his eye fell upon it. He instantly recognized it
                  as the medicine bag and charm of his chief, which authoritatively demanded
                  protection for its wearer from all the tribe. He called the attention of his
                  companion to it. They were both disappointed and chagrined.
               Priscilla was surprised to perceive the difference in their treatment of her after
                  this discovery. They gently removed her cords, carefully bathed her swollen arms
                  and hands in water from the cool stream, and gave her cakes of baked corn meal,
                  and a piece of dried buffalo meat for her breakfast. Believing that this favorable
                  change in their deportment was occasioned sioned by her possession of the pouch, she thought it good policy to intimate
                  to them that she knew its value. She therefore held it up before them, and
                  pronounced,—
               "Omao."
               The two savages nodded their heads, and uttered their comprehensive, guttural
                  "Ugh," accompanied with a forced smile, to indicate that they understood her.
               Priscilla was ignorant of the reason that the discovery of this dried leathern
                  pouch, and awkwardly-made frog, produced such an entire alteration in the
                  deportment of her captors towards her; but if she had known what we are now about
                  to relate, she would have understood it fully.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVII.
               INDIAN GRATITUDE.
               AFTER Omao recovered from the effects of intoxication at New Haven, and recalled
                  to his recollection the sensations which he had experienced whilst under the
                  influence of his potations, it seemed to him as if he had experienced a remarkable
                  deliverance. So strange had every thing seemed—so wonderful were the mysterious
                  motions—the heaving and pitching of the ground beneath his feet, as though it were
                  a liquid mass, troubled by some mighty internal commotion, and the unnatural
                  gyrations of all surrounding objects—the apparent whirling of houses, trees, and
                  hills, as if the earth had formed itself into an immense Maelstrom, and was
                  bearing all things irresistibly around and towards some fatal centre; and when, on
                  the morrow, he found that Nature had resumed her usual appearance, and not a
                  single object was displaced, he thought he had been under the influence of some
                  mighty incantation, which would have proved fatal if it had not been for the timely
                  interference of the white squaw, whom he almost regarded as a goddess of superior
                  power to the being who had thrown nature into such wild confusion.
               As he attributed his deliverance to the unsolicited kindness of this pale-faced
                  squaw, he was desirous of leaving with her some testimonial of his gratitude.
                  Nothing appeared to him more appropriate for that purpose than his medicine bag
                  and charm. To these he attributed a mysterious power, in warding off diseases,
                  preventing accidents, revealing secrets, and thwarting the efforts of sorcerers.
                  They were the most valuable articles he possessed, and were always worn about his
                  neck, as a protection against sudden evils. These, therefore, he gave to
                  Priscilla, on the morning after she had favored him with a night's lodging, by
                  means of which he recovered from the effects of his enchanted spell. He gave them
                  also for another reason, which he would have gladly explained, if he could have
                  made himself understood; and that was, as a token of his protection. It was his
                  intention to guaranty his guardianship to the full extent of his power, at any
                  future period, to any individual who should possess this talisman, and by its
                  presentation should claim his assistance.
               This being his design, he made arrangements, after his return to his distant home,
                  for its fulfilment. He 'called a meeting of the whole tribe; and, after informing
                  them of his visit to the pale faces, and of the manner of his reception among
                  them, not forgetting the strange effects of the cup of enchantment, which they put
                  to his lips, and of the kind treatment extended to him in his troubles by the
                  young white squaw, he charged them, with that stern authority natural to the
                  haughty and despotic chief of the wild red men of the forest, to show themselves
                  friendly to any individual, in any circumstances, who should be, in possession of
                  his medicine bag and charm, and that, in case its possessor should prove to be a
                  pale-faced squaw, he declared, with the impassioned and earnest eloquence for
                  which the Indian, when thoroughly aroused, is distinguished, that any individuals,
                  who should do her the least injury, or refuse to do her any kindness in their
                  power, should be bound to a tree, and be shot at, until the arrows, sticking in
                  their flesh, should cover them as thickly as quills do a porcupine.
               The whole tribe knew that that was no idle threat. Omao was a stern chief, and
                  exacted the obedience of his followers with great severity.
               
               When, therefore, Grizzly Bear and Gray Eagle discovered his medicine bag and charm
                  upon Priscilla, they were startled. They feared the consequences. They would
                  willingly have gone back with her to the place of her seizure, if they had not
                  been fearful of meeting their pursuers, with whose fire-arms and balls their own
                  wooden arrows were poor weapons to contend, and to whom, in consequence of their
                  ignorance of each other's language, they could make no explanation which would
                  secure them against severe treatment for their abduction of the girl.
               As the best thing they could do, they resolved, from that time, to treat her with
                  great kindness; to conciliate, if possible, her friendship, and then make a full
                  statement of the affair to Omao, upon their arrival at their encampment, and throw
                  themselves upon his mercy. They knew that the simple stealing of a captive would
                  not be regarded as any great offence, and they believed that the kindness of their
                  treatment after the discovery of the medicine bag, would convince their chief of
                  their disposition to obey, and would thus prevent any painful results. Besides,
                  they thought it possible that Omao might be gratified to find the pale-faced squaw
                  in his possession session, provided she was placed there without any agency of his
                  own, as he could then effect her deliverance in an imposing manner, and thus
                  furnish her with the most conclusive evidence of his deep sense of gratitude for
                  her former kindness. An event, however, soon occurred, which induced them to
                  change their plans.
               After resting by the side of the cool, flowing stream, until the sun had been
                  above the horizon more than an hour, they recommenced their march. As they
                  ascended a slight elevation of land, they were surprised to find, seated in a
                  valley, on the other side of the hill, a party of Indians. They knew they were not
                  their own tribe, but who they were, or whether friends or enemies, they could not
                  tell. They would have retreated at once, if they could have done it without
                  detection. But they had been seen, and the whole company had sprung to their feet.
                  The two Indians indulged for a few moments in earnest, though in low-toned,
                  conversation, in which Priscilla could distinctly detect the name of "Omao." He
                  was evidently the principal topic of discussion. As there now appeared to be some
                  warlike movements on the part of the newly-discovered Indians, Grizzly Bear drew
                  from his belt a pipe, decorated with
                  white feathers, and advanced towards them, holding it high in the air, so that it
                  might be distinctly seen. It was his offer for a peaceful parley. It was soon
                  responded to by one of the others stepping some distance in advance of his party,
                  with a similar calumet, elevated in his hand. This was the acceptance of the
                  proposal for a friendly interview.
               The two parties now came together. Fortunately, there was one among these
                  strangers who understood the language of the two kidnappers, and who officiated as
                  their interpreter. As the negotiation progressed, Priscilla became alarmed. She
                  discovered that she was the principal subject of conversation; and by the display
                  of skins and wampum, she suspected that offers were being made for her purchase.
                  She was not deceived. After more than an hour's interview, the terms of the
                  bargain were settled. A dozen beautifully-ornamented robes and a long string of
                  white and blue wampum were placed before Grizzly Bear. These he rolled up in two
                  packages, and gave one to Gray Eagle; after which they speedily took their
                  departure, leaving Priscilla in the possession of her new purchasers!
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVIII.
               IMPORTANT CORRESPONDENCE.
               PARTING with Priscilla for the present, let us return and inquire after the events
                  which followed Mr. Clark's address to the governor and General Court, in which he
                  offered to come from Newport and discuss the question of baptism, provided they
                  would appoint a time and place.
               The day following the preparation of this address was Commencement day at
                  Cambridge. The governor, council, ministers, and leading citizens of Boston were
                  there in attendance upon the exercises. The aspects of the place were very
                  different then from their present appearance. Where now are commodious and elegant
                  edifices for the accommodation of the students, for the library, chapel, dining
                  hall, and lodging rooms—where beautiful streets are laid out, with elegant
                  residences bordering either side, then stood, in impenetrable grandeur, the
                  primeval forest, or lands and swamps covered with thick shrubbery, elegantly
                     festooned with various
                  native vines, and ornamented with a great profusion of fragrant, wild, nameless
                  flowers. Those sturdy Puritans could not have dreamed that within the brief limits
                  of two centuries such wonderful changes could transpire as have taken place—that
                  in that retired jungle a city would spring into existence, surrounded by a group
                  of sister cities, with numerous school houses, churches, public buildings, and
                  myriads of inhabitants. Much less could they have imagined the political and
                  national changes which have occurred, by which the two feeble colonies of New
                  England and Virginia have grown into a sisterhood of thirty-one independent
                  states, yet bound together in one beautiful, harmonious. whole, and constituting
                  one of the largest and most powerful nations upon earth.
               During the progress of the exercises at Cambridge on that day, a man was wandering
                  along the shore on the Boston side of Charles River. He was anxious to cross, but
                  unfortunately all the spare boats that belonged to the citizens of the little town
                  were on the Cambridge side, having been used in conveying visitors to the college.
                  Finally an Indian, who had been out fishing in the harbor all the morning, came,
                  on his way home, sufficiently
                     pp. 324 and 325.
                  
                   near the shore to be hailed. The man
                  called to him, and by signs engaged him to paddle him across the stream in his
                  birchen canoe. Having arrived on the other side, the passenger hastened to the
                  college, and placed in the hand of one of the magistrates a letter; it was the
                  offer of Clark to come from Newport, and engage in the much-talked-of discussion.
                  It was not a welcome document. The advocates of infant sprinkling did not wish to
                  meet Mr. Clark in an oral argument. They knew that that rite was safe so long as
                  it was protected by the sword of state, but they could not foresee what results
                  would grow out of a public disputation. Still, as the governor had been the first
                  to propose such a disputation, and the magistrates had assured Mr. Clark it would
                  be granted, they were in a dilemma what course to pursue? so as to avoid the,
                  discussion without a compromise of character, or without a tacit implication of
                  the weakness of their own side. The ministers and magistrates conversed upon tho
                  subject after the reception of Clark's letter at Cambridge with great interest.
                  The object of the consultation was, to devise some way to extricate themselves
                  from their position without yielding any advantage to the Baptists.
               
               Finally the minister of Boston, Mr. Cotton, who was more strongly opposed to the
                  public, controversy than some of the others, drew up a reply to send back, in
                  which he stated, that Mr. Clark had misunderstood the governor, who had not
                  enjoined or counselled a public disputation, but had simply expressed the opinion
                  that if Mr. Clark would confer with the ministers upon the subject of infant
                  baptism, they would satisfy him of the propriety; of the practice, and he would
                  not be able to maintain his own views before them; that this was intended for
                  Clark's information privately, but by no means as a challenge to dispute publicly
                  upon the subject. "Nevertheless," continued this ingenious divine, "if you are
                  forward to dispute, and that you will move it yourself to the court or magistrates
                  about Boston, we shall take order to appoint one who will be ready to answer your
                  motion, you keeping close to the questions to be propounded by yourself; and a
                  moderator shall be appointed, also, to attend upon that service; and whereas you
                  desire you might be free in your dispute, keeping close to the points to be
                  disputed on, without incurring damage by the civil justice, observing what hath
                  before been written, it is granted. The day may be agreed if you yield the
                  premises."
               This was signed by the governor, Mr. Endicott, the deputy governor, Mr. Dudley,
                  and three others. Mr. Clark regarded it as a singular document, and understood its
                  practical bearing. He viewed it as an attempt to change the entire ground of
                  procedure, and shelter the governor from the charge of having proposed the
                  discussion. In the expression of a willingness to grant the discussion, provided
                  Clark would move it himself to the court or magistrates about Boston, he
                  discovered an attempt to throw the whole responsibility of the disputation upon
                  himself, and to make it appear to result from his "forwardness to dispute."
               Two other remarkable features connected with this affair, which increased the
                  cautiousness of Clark's movements, were—first, that whilst this letter of Cotton's
                  was signed by five colonial dignitaries, it was not an order of court; it was not
                  an official document. It was signed by them in their private capacity, and had not
                  the signature of the secretary, Mr. Clark therefore did not regard it as a
                  reliable state paper.
               The other remarkable circumstance was,
                  that this attempt to throw the whole responsibility of originating the discussion
                  of infant baptism upon Clark was made, when they knew that there was a law of the
                  colony which ordered that "if any person or persons shall openly condemn or oppose
                  the baptizing of infants, and shall appear to the court wilfully and obstinately
                  to continue therein, after due time and means of conviction, every such person or
                  persons shall be sentenced to banishment."
               Clark knew that their unofficial document would afford him no legal protection,
                  and that in case the disputation went on in the manner they proposed, it would be
                  an easy thing for some one to enter a complaint against him, and secure his
                  conviction. He therefore wrote the following frank and manly epistle, and
                  forwarded it to them:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              To the honored Governor of the Massachusetts and the rest of
                                 that honorable society, these present.
                              Worthy Senators:—
                           
                           I received a writing, subscribed with five of your hands, by way of
                              answer to a twice-repeated motion of mine before you, which was
                              grounded, as I conceive, sufficiently upon the governor's words in
                              open court, which writing of yours doth no way answer my expectation,
                              nor yet that motion which I made; and whereas (waving that grounded
                              motion) you are pleased to intimate that if I were
                              forward to dispute, and would move it myself to the court
                              or magistrates about Boston, you would appoint one to answer my
                              motion, &c.,—be pleased to understand that, although I am not
                              backward to maintain the faith and order of my Lord, the King of
                              saints, for which I have been sentenced, yet am I not in such a way so
                              forward to dispute, or move therein, lest inconvenience should thereby
                              arise. I shall rather once more repeat my former motion, which if it
                              shall please the honored General Court to accept, and under their
                              secretary's hand shall grant a free dispute, without molestation or
                              interruption, I shall be well satisfied therewith; that what is past I
                              shall forget, and upon your motion shall attend it; thus desiring the
                              Father of mercies not to lay that evil to your charge, I remain your
                              well-wisher,
                           
                              JOHN CLARK.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               To this fair and honorable proposal of Mr. Clark, the governor and magistrates to
                  whom it was addressed thought it the wisest policy to return no answer. The matter was accordingly
                  dropped by their silent retreat. Thus ended the unfortunate challenge of the
                  governor and the persecution of the pastor of the Newport Baptist church.
               Mr. Bates and Stephen, who had from the first deeply sympathized with Clark, were
                  greatly rejoiced when the affair had reached its end.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIX.
               INWARD LIFE.
               IT is time that we inquire into the fate of Mr. Clark's companions. Mr. Crandall,
                  who was sentenced to a fine of five pounds for being one of the company, was
                  released upon promising that he would appear at their next court. But they did not
                  let him know when the next court would sit until it was over; and as he was not
                  present according to his promise, they obliged the keeper to pay his fine.
               With poor Holmes it fared far worse than with either of the others. He had been
                  sentenced to pay a fine of thirty pounds, by the first day of the next court, or
                  else to be well whipped, and to remain in prison until he provided
                  sureties for the fine. Sureties he would not furnish, because he was determined
                  not to pay the fine. Consequently, he was kept in prison. At the time of his trial
                  before the Court of Assistants, when the above cruel sentence was passed against
                  him, he replied,—
               
               "I bless God I am counted worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus;" at which one of
                  the ministers (Mr. John Wilson) so far forgot the sacredness of his office, and
                  the sanctity of the place, as to raise his hand, and strike him in open court, at
                  the same time saying, "The curse of God go with thee."*
                  
               
               
                  *Holmes's Letter, in Backus and Benedict.
               
               During the continuance of the imprisonment of Clark and Crandall, Holmes enjoyed
                  their company. This was a source of unspeakable comfort. The conversation, the
                  sympathy, and the prayers of his fellow-prisoners assisted to banish the
                  despondency and gloom which would otherwise have oppressed him. But after their
                  deliverance, and when he was left alone, he was greatly distressed in spirit. In
                  his own account of it, he said, "After I was deprived of my two loving friends,
                  the adversary stepped in, took hold of my spirit, and troubled me for the space of
                  an hour, and then the Lord came in, and sweetly relieved me, causing me to look to
                  himself; so was I staid and refreshed in the thoughts of my God."
               As friends had paid the fines of the other two prisoners, and had secured their
                  release, it seemed a hard case that he should be left to feel the scourge.
                  Brethren who sympathized with him resolved that he should not. Strongfaith Bates,
                  Stephen, the brother of the mill, and a few others, raised, by a contribution
                  among themselves, enough to pay his fine. But Holmes would not permit it. In reply
                  to their kind offer, he said,—
               "I dare not accept of deliverance in such a way. And though I greatly thank you
                  for your kindness, and would acknowledge, with gratitude, even a cup of cold
                  water, yet I desire not that you should yield to the unrighteous demands of my
                  persecutors. Having committed no crime, I will not permit my friends to pay a
                  single farthing for me."
               The first day of, court was drawing near, when, if the fine was not paid, the
                  substitute would be exacted in stripes, and groans, and blood.
               Though Holmes was strongly convinced of the truth of Baptist sentiments, for which
                  he was imprisoned, and was conscientiously opposed to the payment of the fine, or
                  to the doing of any thing else voluntarily, as a penal requisition, yet he was
                  nowise ambitious of the honors of the whipping post. He shrunk with dread from the
                  sufferings of the scourge. He knew that, when the Court of Assistants sentenced one, to be "well whipped," it meant
                  something, and would be executed to the very letter, Yet the night preceding the
                  infliction of the sentence he passed in sweet, refreshing sleep. In the morning,
                  notwithstanding they knew that they would provoke the wrath of "the powers that
                  be," Strongfaith and Stephen, with several other friends, called at the prison, to
                  comfort and encourage the criminal! After appropriate religious
                  conversation and prayer that God would give strength to suffer, and especially
                  that he would open the eyes of the persecutors to see and love the truth,
                  Strongfaith took from a basket, in which he had stowed a variety of comforts for
                  the poor prisoner, a bottle of old Madeira wine. Pouring out some in a glass, he
                  offered it to Holmes.
               "No, brother. I thank you for your kindness, but I shall take no strong drink
                  until my punishment is over, lest, if I have more strength, courage, and boldness
                  than ordinarily could be expected, the world should say that I was drunk, or that
                  I was carried through by the strength, and comfort of what I had taken. No; let me
                  so suffer that, if I am sustained, God shall have the glory."
               Still, the prisoner was by no means certain that he would not shrink, faint, or
                  show signs of physical cowardice, though he thus spake. Instead, however, of
                  strengthening himself with wine and other luxuries, which had been brought, he
                  left his friends to be entertained with each other, whilst he withdrew into
                  another room, to hold communion with his Lord. So soon as he had retired by
                  himself, he was overwhelmed with the deepest gloom. He was tempted to question his
                  own sincerity and the purity of his motives. A something within, which he
                  attributed to satanic agency, said, "Remember thyself, thy birth, thy breeding,
                  thy friends, thy wife, children, name, credit. Thou art dishonoring all these by
                  thy public scourging. Is this necessary when others are, ready to save thee from
                  suffering, and thy friends from disgrace?" His heart sunk within him. The idea of
                  dishonoring any who were dear to him was more painful than the anticipated
                  punishment; but presently the thought occurred to him, or, as he afterwards
                  expressed it, "There came in sweetly, from the Lord, as sudden an answer: ''Tis
                  for my Lord; I must not deny him, before the sons of men, (for that were to set
                  men above him,) but rather lose all; yea, wife, children, and mine own life
                  also.'" This, however, did not afford him permanent peace; for soon a series of
                     questions rushed into his mind,
                  creating confusion of thought, and reviving his disquietude of feeling. "Is it for
                  the Lord that you are about to suffer? Have you his glory alone in view? Is it not
                  rather for your own, or some others' sake? Is it not obstinacy or pride? Is it not
                  resentment or bigotry? Is not selfishness at the bottom?"
               These unwelcome, and, as they seemed to him, involuntary queries increased his
                  distress; but after a jealous and careful scrutiny of his motives, he was
                  convinced, as he said, that, "It was not for any man's case or sake in this world,
                  that so I had professed and practised, but for my Lord's case and sake, and for
                  him alone; whereupon my spirit was much refresht."
               He was also greatly comforted by the following passages of Scripture, which were
                  sweetly suggested to his mind: "Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's
                  elect?" "Although I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
                  evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me." "And he that
                  continueth to the end shall be saved." But anon, the thoughts of the terrible
                  scourge occurred to him, and he feared that the severity of the dreadful
                  punishment would be too much for his sensitive flesh. The disgrace of the
                  punishment he regarded not. That belonged to others, and not to himself. Like his
                  Lord and Master, he despised the shame. But the anticipated pain of the heavy
                  blows made him shrink. He knew his weakness and sensitiveness, and feared that he
                  would be overcome. Again he betook himself to the throne of grace. He prayed
                  earnestly that the Lord would be pleased to give him a spirit of courage and
                  boldness, a tongue to speak for him, and strength of body to suffer for his sake,
                  and not to shrink from the strokes, nor shed tears, lest the adversaries of the
                  truth should blaspheme, and be hardened, and the weak and feeble hearted be
                  discouraged. His prayer was followed with fresh consolation and strength. It
                  produced a state of trustful submission to God, causing him to yield himself, soul
                  and body, into the hands of his Saviour, and leave the whole disposing of the
                  affair with him.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER L.
               AN AFFECTING SCENE.
               WHEN the time arrived for the condemned Baptist preacher to be led forth to
                  punishment, and the voice of the jailer was heard in the prison, Holmes listened
                  to it with a degree of cheerfulness. Taking his Testament in his hand, he went
                  forth with him to the place of execution. As he approached the whipping post,
                  around which were gathered a crowd of spectators, he calmly saluted them. Two of
                  the magistrates were present to see that the whipper did his duty—Mr. Increase
                  Nowel who had signed his sentence, and Mr. Flint. After waiting some minutes in
                  expectation of the governor's coming, Nowel commanded the executioner to do his
                  office.
               "Permit me," said Holmes, as the executioner seized him, "to say a few words."
               "Now is no time to speak," replied Nowel. But Holmes was unwilling to suffer in
                  silence. He desired to declare to the multitude the grounds of his belief, and the
                  reasons of his punishment. He therefore lifted up his voice and said,—
               "Men, brothers, fathers, and countrymen, I beseech you give me leave to speak a
                  few words, and the rather because here are many spectators to see me punished, and
                  I am to seal with my blood, if God give strength, that which I hold and practise
                  in reference to the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus. That which I have to
                  say, in brief, is this: although I am no disputant, yet, seeing I am to seal with
                  my blood what I hold, I am ready to defend by the word, and to dispute that point
                  with any that shall come forth to withstand it."
               Magistrate Nowel told him, "Now is no time to dispute."
               "Then," continued Holmes, "I desire to give an account of the faith and order I
                  hold." This he uttered three times. But Magistrate Flint cried out to the
                  executioner, "Fellow, do thine office, for this fellow would but make a long
                  speech to delude the people."
               In compliance with this authoritative mandate, the executioner roughly seized
                  Holmes, and began to strip off his clothes. The sentence was to be inflicted upon
                  the prisoner, not upon his garments. But Holmes was determined mined to speak if possible. Whilst therefore the
                  whipper was removing his clothes and preparing him for the lash, he said to the
                  people,—
               "That which I am to suffer for is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus
                  Christ."
               "No," replied Magistrate Nowel, "it is for your error, and going about to seduce
                  the people."
               "Not for my error," said Holmes, "for in all the time of my imprisonment, wherein
                  I was left alone, (my brethren being gone,) which of all your ministers in all
                  that time came to convince me of an error? and when, upon the governor's words, a
                  motion was made for a public dispute, and upon fair terms so often renewed, and
                  desired by hundreds, what was the reason it was not granted?"
               This was a close and significant question. As all the multitude knew that a public
                  disputation had been anticipated, but had not yet taken place, the inquiry of
                  Holmes seemed to demand an answer. Nowel therefore replied,—
               "It was the fault of him who went away and would not dispute," referring to Clark.
                  But this, as we have already shown, was not the case.
               Flint became impatient at this 
                     coloquy
                     colloquy
                  , and repeated his order to the executioner,—
               "Fellow, do thine office." Holmes, however, would not remain silent. Whilst being
                  disrobed, he said,—
               "I would not give my body into your hands to be thus bruised on any other account
                  whatever; yet now I would not give the hundredth part of a wampum-peague*
                     to free it out of your hands."
               
                  *The sixth part of a penny
               
               "Unbutton here," said the executioner, as he gave his jacket a jerk.
               "No," said Holmes; "I make as much conscience of unbuttoning one button as I do of
                  paying the sentence of thirty pounds. I will do nothing towards executing such an
                  unjust law."
               Faithful to his word, he would not voluntarily assist the executioner in the least
                  in removing his garments from his back.
               He was as helpless as if he were asleep, and the executioner had to handle him as
                  though he were a statue. Still he continued addressing the people.
               "The Lord," said he, "having manifested his love towards me, in giving me
                  repentance towards God and faith in Christ, and so to be baptized in water by a
                  messenger of Jesus, in the name of the
                  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, wherein I have fellowship with him in his death,
                  burial, and resurrection, I am now come to be baptized in afflictions by your
                  hands, that so I may have further fellowship with my Lord, and am not ashamed of
                  his sufferings, for by his stripes am I healed."
               The executioner, having removed so much of his garments as would hinder the effect
                  of the scourge, and having fastened him to the post, seized a three-corded whip,
                  raised his hands, and laid on the blows in an unmerciful manner. Stroke followed
                  stroke as rapidly as was consistent with effective execution, each blow leaving
                  its crimson furrow, or its long blue wale in the sufferer's quivering flesh. The
                  only pause which occurred during the infliction of this barbarous punishment was
                  when the executioner ceased a moment in order to spit in his hands, so as to take
                  a firmer hold of the handle of the whip, and render the strokes more severe. This
                  he did three times. During the infliction of his painful scourging, Holmes said to
                  the people,—
               "Though my flesh and my spirit fail, yet God will not fail." The poor sufferer did
                  not fail. He found that his strength was equal to his day. Though the lash was
                  doing its bloody work upon his sensitive flesh, yet his spirit was sustained by
                  heavenly consolations. In his own account of his experience during this dreadful
                  ordeal, Holmes subsequently said,—
               "It pleased the Lord to come in and fill my heart and tongue as a vessel full, and
                  with an audible voice I brake forth, praying the Lord not to lay this sin to their
                  charge, and telling the people that now I found he did not fail me, and therefore
                  now I should trust him forever who failed me not; for in truth, as the strokes
                  fell upon me, I had such a spiritual manifestation of God's presence as I never
                  had before, and the outward pain was so removed from me that I could well bear it,
                  yea, and in a manner felt it not, although it was grievous, as the spectators
                  said; the man striking with all his strength, spitting in his hand three times,
                  with a three-corded whip, giving me therewith thirty strokes."
               After the requisite number of blows had been given, equalling the number of pounds
                  that he was fined, (from which we learn that, according to the Puritan standard of
                  penal measure, one blow of a three-corded whip, well laid on, was an equivalent to
                  one pound sterling,) the cords which fastened him to the whipping post were untied, and he was set at
                  liberty. With joyfulness in his heart and cheerfulness in his countenance, he
                  turned to the magistrates Flint and Nowel, and said,—
               "You have struck me as with roses." But not wishing them to imagine that he
                  regarded the punishment as literally light, nor that he was sustained by his own
                  strength, he added,—
               "Although the Lord hath made it easy to me, yet I pray God it may not be laid to
                  your charge."
               The crowd now gathered around him, some from mere curiosity, others inwardly
                  rejoicing that the heretic had been scourged, whilst a third class were filled
                  with mingled emotions of sympathy with his sorrows, and indignation at his
                  wrongs.
            
            
               CHAPTER LI.
               EFFECTS OF PERSECUTION.
               AMONGST those whose feelings of sympathy and indignation were aroused at the
                  barbarous treatment of Holmes, were two individuals who were so rejoiced that the
                  sufferer had been sustained under his cruelties, and that he left the ignominious
                  post with so much composure, and even with pleasantness of countenance, that they
                  shook hands with him; and one of them, whose name was John Spur, a freeman of the
                  colony, said to him, "Blessed be God for thee, my brother," and walked along with
                  him to the prison. The other, who simply shook hands with him, was another
                  freeman, Mr. John Hazel. Many others testified their friendship for him, and
                  glorified God on his account. To some, however, who were present, these
                  expressions of sympathy were extremely displeasing. They looked upon it as a
                  connivance at the crime, and a contempt of the government. As informers, they
                  immediately made complaint of what they had witnessed nessed, and a number of warrants were issued for
                  the apprehension of these sympathiZing offenders.
               When Holmes reached the prison, his body was found to be in a terrible
                  condition—his body, not simply his back, for the lashes of the whip were so long
                  that they lapped over his back, and left their gory marks upon his side.
               Eaton, who had been a spectator of all the proceedings, ran home immediately after
                  the whipping, obtained some rags and oil, and hastened to the prison, where, like
                  the good Samaritan, he dressed the wounded man's sores. When it was known that
                  Holmes had received such kindness, the inquiry became general, who was the
                  surgeon. And the report was soon circulated that he was to be arrested.
               So severe was the chastisement of the prisoner that for many days he could not
                  endure the pain occasioned by the wounded parts of his body touching the bed. All
                  the rest that he experienced was such as be obtained by supporting himself upon
                  his knees and elbows.
               The day after the whipping, whilst Spur and Hazel were attending to their
                  business, they were surprised by a constable calling upon them, and telling them
                  they were prisoners. As his authority, he showed them the following document:— 
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "To the keeper or his deputy:
                              
                              By virtue hereof, you are to take into your custody and safe
                                 keeping the body of John Spur, for a heinous offence by him
                                 committed; hereof fail not. Dated the 5th of the 7th month, 1651.
                                 Take also into your safe keeping John Hazel.
                              
                                 By the court,
                                 INCREASE NOWEL."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               They were accordingly both taken to prison, the heinous offence
                  consisting of the act of shaking hands and speaking with Holmes after his
                  punishment, and, consequently, after he had satisfied the law, and was no longer
                  an involuntary prisoner.
               They were afterwards taken to the court, and examined. They had no trial, neither
                  were they allowed to meet their complainants face to face, but were condemned upon
                  the evidence furnished by the depositions of two individuals, the stronger of the
                  two documents being as follows:— 
                     
                        
                           
                              "I,——Cole, being in the market-place when Obadiah Holmes came from the
                                 whipping post, John Spur came and met him presently, laughing in
                                 his face, saying, 'Blessed be God for thee, brother;' and so did go
                                 with him, laughing upon him, towards the prison, which was very
                                 grievous to me to see him harden the man in his sin, and showing
                                 much contempt of authority by that carriage, as if he had been
                                 unjustly punished, and had suffered as a righteous man under a
                                 tyrannical government. Deposed before the court the 5th of the 7th
                                 month.
                              
                                 INCREASE NOWEL."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               They were sentenced to receive ten lashes each, or pay a fine of forty shillings.
                  The latter they could not conscientiously do. A Mr. Bendal, who was a friend to
                  Hazel, offered to pay his, but he refused, saying,—
               "I thank you for this offer of love; but I believe it will be no acceptable
                  service for any man to pay a penny for me in this case." Yet, notwithstanding his
                  refusal, the court accepted the proffer, and gave him his discharge. Hazel was
                  upwards of sixty years of age, and died soon after his release.*

               Spur was kept in prison nearly a week, expecting pecting every day to be taken to
                  the market square, tied to the whipping post, and receive his ten lashes; but,
                  without his permission, some sympathizing friend paid his fine, and secured his
                  deliverance.
               These persecutions were the means of attracting the attention of many to the
                  doctrines of the sufferers. Sympathy elicited inquiry, and inquiry produced
                  conviction. The sentiments of the Baptists spread. Many were convinced of the
                  scripturalness of their views of baptism, and desired to be buried with Christ in
                  that beautiful and significant ordinance, Their desire could not be refused. The
                  ordinance was administered repeatedly, though with the greatest privacy, for fear
                  of prisons, fines, and scourging.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LII.
               A REPULSIVE OFFER.
               WE left Priscilla in the possession of her purchasers. The principal motive which
                  Grizzly Bear and Gray Eagle had in selling her was, to prevent all knowledge of
                  her capture from reaching Omao. The two robbers feared the result if their stern
                  chief should discover their deed.
               The Indians who now had possession of the unfortunate girl were a party of the
                  Iroquois, a numerous and powerful tribe, who occupied a vast extent of country to
                  the west and south of the present Hudson River. They had been on a marauding
                  expedition, and were on their return. During their homeward journey, which lasted
                  for several days Priscilla was so constantly and vigilantly watched that not the
                  least opportunity of escape was offered her. She was led on through forests,
                  swamps, and brooks, over high hills, and through deep glens covered with rough,
                  loose, sharp stones, until, with dreadfully lacerated feet, and her arms and face
                  torn with the thorns and briers through which she had been compelled to force her
                  way, she was finally introduced into the midst of the village of tents and rude
                  huts which her owners called their home.
               Leaving for the imagination of the reader to picture the great joy which the
                  return of this, party occasioned, and the great curiosity which was manifested by
                  the old and young, male and female, in their examination of the white squaw, we
                  shall confine our narrative to the captive herself.
               When Priscilla found herself, to all appearance, in hopeless and perpetual
                  bondage, she resolved that, with assistance from on high, she would endeavor to
                  maintain a close walk with God, conscientiously observe secret prayer, and would
                  make herself useful to the full extent of her ability. She thought that perhaps
                  she had been sent there, in the mysterious providence of God, for the conversion
                  of some of that people. She resolved, therefore, that she would maintain a
                  Christian character, evince a spirit of meekness, and avail herself of every
                  opportunity to do them both temporal and spiritual good.
               A spirit of sincere benevolence will find, even in the most unpropitious
                     circumstances, means for its
                  practical development. If it cannot indulge itself in one form of usefulness, it
                  will seek another. So numerous are the various classes of the ignorant and the
                  suffering that a philanthropic disposition need never be at a loss for objects of
                  compassion.
               Without entering into a minute account of Priscilla's course at this period of her
                  history, it must suffice to say, that by availing herself of every means in her
                  power, she soon became sufficiently acquainted with the language to understand and
                  speak it, after which she made rapid progress. By her attention to the sick, the
                  aged, and the infirm, she secured their confidence and esteem. When those for whom
                  she prescribed, recovered their health, their restoration was ascribed to her
                  treatment. Being skilful in the use of the needle, she assisted in ornamenting
                  moccasons, and in embroidering robes of dressed buffalo and deer skins. She was
                  useful in the culinary department, and suggested new modes of preparing food,
                  which proved very acceptable to the epicures of the forest. She was especially
                  interested in the children, with whom she was a great favorite. She talked with
                  them about God, about their own sinfulness, about the sufferings and death of
                  Jesus, about heaven and perdition. Upon the minds of others, too, she inculcated,
                  as opportunity offered, the prominent truths of the Bible. * * *
               Time passed on. Priscilla continued to increase in the confidence and affection of
                  the people. Some of them regarded her with almost religious veneration, as though
                  she had come from some other world. During all this time, however, she was the
                  acknowledged slave, or property, of the chief who had purchased her from the two
                  kidnappers. He had the power of life and death over her. In his cabin she made her
                  home; to him she was bound to be obedient. Unfortunately for the captive, the
                  favorite wife of her owner was taken sick. Every method that could be devised for
                  her recovery was adopted, but without success, and after lingering a few weeks,
                  she died.
               After this the bereaved chief treated Priscilla with more than usual attention. He
                  lightened her labors, gave her beautiful pieces of dressed skins, and beads with
                  which to ornament them for moccasons or robes, and in various other ways he
                  manifested a particular interest in her welfare. As Priscilla feared, all this was
                  but preparatory to the repulsive proposal for her to become his wife, which he
                  urged by every motive in his power.
                  Promises and threatenings were equally unavailing; and when, in his anger, he
                  declared that if she persisted in her refusal he would put her to death by slow
                  tortures, she calmly replied, that death in any form would be preferable to a life
                  with him.
               "My trust," said she, "is in the Great Spirit. He will be my protector. I do not
                  fear what man can do unto me."
            
            
               CHAPTER LIII.
               IMPORTANT MOVEMENT.
               THE treatment which the persecuted Baptists had received from the government of
                  Massachusetts produced a decided effect upon Strongfaith and Stephen. It brought
                  them to a decision. After repeated conferences with each other upon the subject,
                  they resolved to apply to Mr. Holmes for baptism before he returned home to
                  Newport. After, therefore, he had sufficiently recovered from the effects of his
                  whipping, these two candidates visited him, and presented their request for the
                  ordinance.
               "I must first know," said he, "what evidence there is that you are the disciples
                  of Christ. I find, from the New Testament, that those only were baptized who had
                  repented of their sins, and believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. I have no authority
                  to administer the ordinance to any other."
               The two candidates then related to Mr. Holmes their Christian experience, and
                     their views of religious truth and
                  of gospel ordinances. Believing them to be proper subjects for baptism, he agreed
                  to administer the ordinance to them the next Lord's day.
               As quite a number of individuals, convinced of Baptist sentiments, and others,
                  known to be dissatisfied with infant sprinkling, who were investigating the
                  subject, were then in Boston, information of the anticipated baptism was privately
                  circulated amongst them
               In respect of Mr. Bates, the step he was about to take was one of great
                  importance, and, as he foresaw, would involve consequences of a disagreeable kind.
                  He was a member of the Congregational church. By voluntarily coming out from them,
                  he was condemning, in a most decided manner, their practice. He was separating
                  himself from many whom he tenderly and strongly loved. He knew that his case would
                  be taken up in church meeting—that it would not be strange if his motives should
                  be impugned, and his character aspersed. Public excommunication would be
                  unavoidable, and perhaps, also, a trial before the Court of Assistants. But he had
                  made up his mind to relinquish all, and suffer all for the truth's sake. An
                  important principle was at stake, and he was determined that it should not be
                  compromised from any personal consideration whatever.
               With Stephen the case was widely different. He had united with no church. His act,
                  therefore, would not subject him to ecclesiastical discipline, though it would
                  necessarily prevent him from becoming a freeman in the colony, as that was the
                  exclusive privilege of the members of the Congregational church. His position in
                  the community would be far from pleasant, and would probably subject him to the
                  necessity of a removal to some other place. Besides, he had every reason for
                  believing that when his parents beard of his course, they would be exceedingly
                  displeased, and perhaps would write for him to return home. Still he resolved to
                  go forward, leaving, the consequences with Him whose law he was obeying.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LIV.
               A DISCUSSION.
               THE Sabbath came. It was a beautiful, warm, clear day. The place selected for the
                  occasion was a small cove on the west side of the neck that united Boston to
                  Roxbury. No houses were in the vicinity, and they had no reason to fear an
                  interruption. Very early in the morning, individuals, singly and in couples, began
                  to approach the place. Presently Mr. Holmes came, and soon after, Strongfaith and
                  Stephen. The little assembly rapidly increased. It was much larger than had been
                  expected. As Mr. Bates looked round upon them, he saw a number whom he knew were
                  strongly opposed to Baptist sentiments. He whispered the fact to Mr. Holmes.
               "No matter," said he. "He who is for us is more than all they who are against
                  us."
               "If we are brought before the court, there will be plenty of witnesses against
                  us."
               "The more important it is for us to observe apostolic order in our service,"
                  replied Holmes.
               When the appointed hour arrived, a hymn was sung, after which Mr. Holmes addressed
                  the company, presenting the various scriptural reasons for administering the
                  ordinance by immersion, and to believers only. It was his previous intention to
                  have said not a word; but knowing that a number were present who had never seen
                  the ordinance before, and who were ignorant of the reasons of Baptist sentiments,
                  he considered it his duty to express the grounds of their belief. Having done so,
                  he urged them to search the Scriptures for themselves.
               "The Bible," said he, "is a plain book, and written for the benefit of plain
                  people. All its fundamental truths we may all discover if we only search it with a
                  humble, teachable spirit. Receive not the sentiments you have now heard simply
                  upon my declaration, but search the Scriptures for yourselves, and see if you can
                  find any command to baptize infants, or any instance of the baptism of such; see
                  if the circumstances which are narrated in each case of baptism do not either
                  express or imply penitence and faith in the candidate."
               "Whole households were baptized," said some one in the company of spectators;
                  "were there no infants amongst them?"
               
               "We do not read of any," calmly replied Holmes. "You who believe in infant baptism
                  are bound to show that there were such; but where the Scriptures are so utterly
                  silent upon a point as they are upon that, you will find it difficult to press
                  from them any testimony whatever. Furnish a single clear instance from the Bible
                  of any infant being baptized, and the question is settled in your favor. But this
                  never has been, and never will be done."
               "It is not necessary to find such proofs, seeing that baptism has taken the place
                  of circumcision; for, as circumcision was administered to infants, so must baptism
                  be, which is its substitute."
               "But where, friend, dost thou find in the New Testament that baptism is a
                  substitute for circumcision? Neither the Saviour nor his apostles ever taught such
                  a doctrine. Circumcision, like the rest of the Jewish ritual, has answered its
                  end, and is done away."
               "How do you make that out?" continued the interlocutor, who proved to be Cole, who
                  had given his deposition against John Spur.
               "Very easily, friend: and if thou wilt permit me to ask thee a few questions, I
                  will show thee. Did not God make a covenant with Abraham?"
               "Certainly."
               "In that covenant there were two parties, both of whom were to do something; these
                  parties were God and Abraham. Now, what did God promise to do, as his part of the
                  covenant? Read the account in the seventeenth of Genesis, and you will see that he
                  promised that he would make Abraham the father of numerous descendants—that
                  nations and kings should spring from him, and that he would give him the fruitful
                  land of Canaan for a possession. Having made these promises, what did he require
                  of the patriarch as his part of the covenant?"
               "He required him to have all the males of his family circumcised."
               "Very well; now, what was circumcision the sign of?"
               "It was the sign, or the token, of this covenant."
               "That is to say," continued Holmes, "circumcision was the visible sign or evidence
                  that such a covenant had been formed; and doubtless it was to be continued upon
                  all the male descendants of Abraham, and male proselytes, until it was either
                  changed or abrogated. Here is the account," said he, as he opened the Bible, and
                  commenced reading.
               
               "But," said Cole, after Holmes had closed his book, "circumcision was a seal, as
                  well as a sign."
               "I admit it; it was, as Paul says, the seal of the righteousness of his faith;
                  that is, it was the seal, or attestation, which God gave to Abraham, that his
                  faith was a righteous act—that God accepted it. But what we contend for is, that
                  circumcision has answered its purpose, has accomplished its end, and is done
                  away."
               "How do you make that appear?"
               "In the first place, God did make the descendants of Abraham very numerous; in the
                  second place, he gave them the land of Canaan for a possession; and in the third
                  place, by giving them the revelation of his will, a religious ceremonial, and
                  granting them, on various occasions, his special protection, he proved himself to
                  be their God. He has, therefore, in these various respects, fulfilled his part of
                  the covenant, and Abraham, with his descendants, by the universal adoption of
                  circumcision, has fulfilled his. Circumcision is now abolished. Under the
                  Christian dispensation, it is prohibited."
               "Changed, you should say, for baptism."
               "Changed for baptism!" replied Holmes, with much earnestness: "why, then, did not
                  the Saviour say so? or why do not the apostles tell us this? It is marvellous that
                  they should have kept such impenetrable silence upon a subject of such great
                  importance. But I can convince ye, if ye are open to conviction, that that was not
                  the case—or if it was, that the inspired apostles were entirely ignorant of
                  it."
               "How wilt thou do that, friend?"
               "In this way: There were several occasions in the early history of the church when
                  the question was earnestly discussed, whether circumcision ought or ought not to
                  be continued. If baptism had come in the place of circumcision, those were
                  occasions which demanded the statement of that fact; its statement would have
                  settled the question authoritatively and forever; and if it had been a fact, the
                  apostles could not, at those times, have omitted to mention it. In the fifteenth
                  chapter of Acts is an instance. It occurred at Antioch, and is as follows," said
                  Holmes, reading from his Testament: "'And certain men which came down from Judea
                  taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses,
                  ye cannot be saved. When, therefore, Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
                  disputation with them, they determined
                  that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto
                  the apostles and elders about this question.' That was their specific object,
                  namely, to ask the apostles and elders at Jerusalem whether they ought to continue
                  the practice of circumcision. When they arrived there, and stated their object, it
                  occasioned 'much disputing.' Parties were formed; some contended for the negative,
                  others for the affirmative, of the question. Peter and James both delivered
                  addresses on the subject, in which they opposed the practice of circumcision.
                  Finally, a letter was written to the church at Antioch, answering their inquiry in
                  the negative. Now, in all that discussion, as narrated in the New Testament,
                     not a word was said about baptism having come in the place of
                     circumcision, when, if such had been the case, the statement of that fact was
                     the very answer to have been given, and, without doubt, would have been
                  given. It is altogether improbable that if baptism had supplanted circumcision,
                  the apostles and elders of the church at Jerusalem would have omitted to state so
                  important a fact on that occasion. The question at issue demanded the statement;
                  the answer would have been defective without it. But, as there is not the least
                  reference to such a change, the conclusion is unavoidable that it did not exist.
                  Indeed, nowhere is it said in the New Testament to the Judaizing teachers, who
                  desired to continue circumcision, that that institution must no longer be
                  continued, because it had given place to baptism. It is wonderful
                  that there should be no statement or record of such a remarkable change if it had
                  ever occurred. Entire silence upon the subject, when its statement was so
                  imperatively called for, is conclusive evidence against it."
               After a few more words between the parties, the conversation ceased.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LV.
               A BEAUTIFUL SERVICE.
               THE morning sun was now fairly above the horizon, and was shining in all its
                  strength. The hills and woods were arrayed in drapery of the richest emerald. A
                  few summer flowers timidly showed themselves here and there, as if fearful of
                  attracting attention, lest they too should be persecuted for not
                     conforming to the deep green of the standing order of
                  trees and plants around them. Not a breath of wind was stirring. The water was an
                  immense mirror, reflecting, with perfect minuteness of detail, every hill, rock,
                  tree, and plant, which fringed its borders. A few Indians, who had been attracted
                  to the spot by this unusual gathering, appeared to be singularly
                  reduplicated—their light and graceful canoes, with their gay occupants, appearing
                  as distinctly, though inverted, beneath the surface as above it. The birds, as if
                  rejoicing at the return of the Sabbath, or as if glorying in their own freedom of
                  opinion and practice, made the groves vocal with their charming melody—they
                  offered sinless matins to their Creator. Above, the deep azure was relieved by
                  heaps of fleecy clouds, some of snowy whiteness, others of golden hue, which
                  appeared fixed upon the surface of the sky, as if they had been so many solid
                  bowlders.
               After the offering of prayer, appropriate to the specific object and the peculiar
                  circumstances of their assembling, Mr. Holmes took the arm of Mr. Bates, and
                  slowly led him into the transparent stream, at the same time saying,—
               "We read that when Philip baptized the eunuch, 'they went both of them down into
                  the water, and he baptized him.'"
               Having reached a sufficient depth, he paused; then laying his right hand on the
                  candidate's back, and placing the other on his breast, over the crossed hands of
                  Mr. Bates, he said,—
               "On a profession of thy repentance of sin and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, I
                  baptize thee, my brother, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,"
                  at the same time gently laying him backwards in the water until he was entirely
                  immersed—the water covering him like a transparent veil. When he arose, the
                  administrator said,—
               
               "The apostle Paul tells us we are 'buried with Christ by baptism into death; that
                  like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we
                  also should walk in newness of life.' He speaks of baptism as a burial, from which
                  also there is a resurrection; and in the ordinance, as you have now seen it
                  administered, were there not both of these—a burial and a resurrection? Again he
                  says, 'For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall
                  be also in the likeness of his resurrection.' In planting is there not burial of
                  the seed?
               "In his Epistle to the Colossians, 'buried with him in baptism, wherein,' i. e.,
                  in which baptism, 'also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation
                  of God, who hath raised him from the dead.' The burial is in the baptism, in the
                  visible ordinance, and this burial has a twofold reference: first to the death and
                  resurrection of the Saviour, and secondly to the moral transformation of character
                  which has been experienced by the candidate, where there was a death in respect to
                  the reigning power of sin, and a resurrection to a newness of life. How
                  beautifully are all these symbolized by the ordinance as you have now seen it
                  administered! And hence how
                  
                     pp. 368 and 369.
                   impressively significant is baptism when properly administered! but how
                  entirely void of all appropriate significance is it when sprinkling is adopted!
                  for in that case how totally diverse is the symbol from the thing symbolized!
                  Where is there any burial in sprinkling, or where is the resurrection?"
               After reaching the shore with Mr. Bates, he then took Stephen, saying,—
               "'Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? even by taking heed thereto
                  according to thy word,'" and baptized him in the same manner.
               "We have now," said Mr. Holmes, "followed the New Testament examples as closely as
                  was in our power. John baptized Jesus in Jordan; we have baptized in a river: John
                  baptized at Enon, near to Salem, because there was much water there; we have come
                  to this place to administer the ordinance because there is much water here: when
                  Philip baptized the Ethiopian, they went both of them down into the water, and
                  after the baptism they came up out of the water; we have done the same; and in
                  those primitive baptisms we are informed by the apostle Paul, in different
                  Epistles, that there was a burial—buried in baptism; in the ordinance as
                  administered on this occasion there was
                  a burial—both of these disciples have been buried in baptism, by which act they
                  acknowledge their dependence upon the death and resurrection of Christ, as the
                  grounds of their Christian hope, and by which also they profess that they have
                  died unto sin, and have arisen to a newness of life. Add to all this, friends,
                  what is generally admitted by learned divines of other denominations, that the
                  original meaning of the word 'baptize' is to immerse, and is not the evidence
                  conclusive, that we have now imitated the example of Christ and his apostles? The
                  baptism of these candidates was the answering of a good conscience towards God.
                  They will now go on their way rejoicing." And then, lifting his hands and raising
                  his eyes towards heaven, he added,—
               "Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room."
               Pausing a moment, and looking around upon the spectators, he continued,—
               "May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ descend upon you, and lead you all to the
                  knowledge and the acknowledgment of the truth; and to his name shall be the glory
                  forever. Amen."
               "Well now," said the little, bent, talkative Mrs. Strangger, who was one of the
                  few women present, to another who stood by her side, "well, now, that raaly looks
                  kind o' reasonable, don't it?" But without waiting for any reply, she continued,
                  "I never considered on it in that light. I don't know as I ever heern a point made
                  plainer. Why, la! if it had been Parson Cotton who had said all that, I should
                  believe every word; for our minister is a learned man. But there, la! I must be
                  careful what I say, or they will have me before the court. I wonder if the poor
                  man's back is healed yet. If it isn't, I should think he'd take cold by going so
                  far into that wet water, and have a dreadful time. I hope, even if he is a
                  heretic, they won't catch and whip him again. It was dreadful to see the poor man
                  lashed so."
               "It would not be strange if they did, for here is the honorable Secretary Nowel,
                  who has seen and heard all this morning, and it would not be wonderful, (as he is
                  a great hater of heretics,) if he should have this man arrested again for
                  disturbing the public peace."
               That was precisely what Holmes and his friends feared. They saw Nowel there, and,
                  judging from his previous conduct, they thought it improbable that he would
                     allow this to pass with impunity. It
                  was to them a mystery how he and the other Puritans had heard of the
                  administration of the ordinance, for it was thought by those interested, that
                  successful precautions had been adopted to preserve secrecy. The facts in the case
                  were these: Little Abel Eaton slept in a trundlebed, in the same room with his
                  parents. One night, after he had retired, and the parents supposed him sound
                  asleep, they entered into conversation upon the anticipated baptism of Strongfaith
                  and Stephen.
               "When will it take place?" asked the wife.
               "Next Sabbath morning, at sunrise," answered Mr. Eaton.
               "Where?"
               "In the sandy cove, on the west side of the neck, just beyond Philemon
                  Brown's."
               This Abel heard. The next day, he called at Mrs. Strangger's, and, in childish
                  thoughtlessness, told her. This was a piece of information too rich, too important
                  for the little curved-back woman to keep to herself.
               After getting through with her work, and brushing up her house, away she trudged
                  to some of the more important families of her acquaintance, and communicated the
                  news. From them it circulated to others, and was thus the means of bringing a
                  number of unexpected persons to the baptismal scene. This, however, operated
                  favorably, as it gave them an opportunity of witnessing the ordinance, which they
                  had never seen before, and was the means of awakening, in the minds of some, a
                  spirit of inquiry upon the subject.
               The fears which had been cherished were not groundless. Holmes was earnestly
                  advised to make his escape, as it was rumored that a warrant had been issued for
                  his apprehension, and he could not remain long concealed. Not being at all
                  ambitious of the honors of imprisonment, nor in the least degree solicitous to
                  have his wounds reopened with the three-corded whip, to the gaze of a gaping
                  multitude in the market square, he decided to escape.
               "It will be," said his friends, "according to the instruction of the great Head of
                  the church, who said, 'When they persecute you in one city, flee ye to
                  another.'"
               Accordingly, on Monday night, so soon as it was sufficiently dark to avoid
                  observation, he left the house of Mr. Bates, where he had stopped, and started for
                  home. It was well he did so; for on the next day, a constable came to the house
                  with a warrant, and searched the house
                  from top to bottom for "the body of Obadiah Holmes." But it could not be
                  found.
               When his friends at Newport and Providence learned that he was on his way home,
                  they went several miles into the woods, to meet him. The greeting was one of
                  tender and affectionate interest. The old forest echoed with the voice of prayer,
                  and with songs of gladness and praise that God, had sustained him under the
                  dreadful severities through which he had passed, and had granted him, at last,
                  deliverance from his persecutors.
            
            
               CHAPTER LVI.
               PRUDENTIAL MOVEMENTS.
               AFTER the baptism of the two candidates, Strongfaith and Stephen found their
                  condition far from being pleasant. The former, as he anticipated, was excluded
                  from the church, and disfranchised as a citizen. Stephen soon learned that many of
                  his former friends were estranged from him. He was looked at askance, and treated
                  coldly. Both knew that their movements were closely observed, and that, if they
                  were guilty of violating the law which prohibited opposition to infant sprinkling,
                  they would be compelled to suffer the penalty. As all meetings of the Baptists
                  were forbidden, they could not assemble with their own brethren, except by
                  stealth; and even then, these secret meetings were always attended with danger.
                  The ministers, the magistrates, and the members of the church, except those of the
                  latter who were investigating the subject, were strongly opposed to the sentiments
                  of the Baptists, and felt themselves bound to do all in their power to prevent the spreading of what they
                  believed to be such dangerous doctrines. All suspected persons were marked, and
                  their course carefully watched. They were constantly subjected to a kind of social
                  quarantine. In respect to sympathy and intercourse, a healthful distance was
                  maintained between them and the standing order—the laws of this social quarantine
                  being regulated by the latter. The practical operation of all this was any thing
                  but agreeable to those who were under the ban. Mr. and Mrs. Eaton resolved to go
                  where they could breathe freely. Their condition was about as fatal to their
                  happiness as before they left England. Persecution from the established church in
                  England, because they were Puritans, seemed to them no worse than persecution from
                  the standing order in New England, because they were Baptists. In both cases there
                  was equally a violation of the rights of conscience—a disregard of religious
                  liberty. It was to them a matter of astonishment that, when the Puritans had
                  suffered so severely on account of their religious opinions at home, and when they
                  had expressed such strong condemnation of the cruelties of the episcopal
                  government, that, in the new world, they should adopt similar principles ples, and
                  pursue a similar course towards those who differed from them. It seemed to the
                  sufferers that, if the persecuting principles of the Puritans were carried out,
                  they would compel them to be as severe upon the Episcopalians, if they should ever
                  come into the colony, as the latter had ever been upon them. Parties only, and not
                  principles, would then be changed.
               Believing they could have no peaceful enjoyment of their religious views in
                  Massachusetts, Mr. Eaton and his wife resolved to emigrate to Providence, where
                  Roger Williams tolerated religious opinions of every kind. For similar reasons
                  Stephen determined to accompany them. Some days were required for them to get
                  ready. As Mrs. Eaton was unwilling to go by land, her husband was obliged to
                  obtain a boat, store it with water and provisions, and get his furniture and other
                  property on board. In the mean time, the rumor was circulated, that a number of
                  warrants had been issued for the apprehension of others, besides Spur and Hazel,
                  who had expressed kindness and sympathy for Mr. Holmes, after his whipping. As
                  Stephen was one of them, and as he had visited Holmes in prison, and ministered to
                  his wants, and as he had recently been baptized, he, with good reason, supposed that he was one of those for whose
                  "body" the constables were seeking. He therefore changed his mind, and resolved to
                  start off secretly for Providence, by land, rather than, by waiting to go by
                  water, increase the danger of being seized. He kept himself, concealed, therefore,
                  by day; but when the shadows of evening arrived, he left his hiding-place, took a
                  gun and a small pack containing some food and a few garments, and started over
                  Boston neck towards the only spot on the whole of the American continent where
                  perfect toleration of opinion existed.
            
            
               CHAPTER LVII.
               A MOMENTOUS OCCASION.
               * * * IT was a great day amongst the Indians. They had been visited by a
                  distinguished chief and a number of braves from the distant east. Out of respect
                  to these strangers, several successive days had been spent in dancing, wrestling,
                  shooting for prizes, and feasting, and the whole was to be closed by one of their
                  most exciting and horrid scenes, yet one in which they were accustomed to take
                  infernal delight.
               The whole tribe were collected together, painted, plumed, and otherwise
                  ornamented, according to the most approved Indian style. in the centre of an
                  extensive, prairie-like lawn was a large tree, whose trunk, from the ground to its
                  first branches, was straight, and comparatively smooth. This was the centre of
                  attraction. Groups of the young warriors were there assembled, some sharpening
                  their tomahawks, which had been obtained by traffic with the French settlements in
                  Canada, others preparing their bows and
                  arrows, whilst others, whose preparations were all completed, were lounging upon
                  the grass, or standing in small companies, engaged in conversation. Presently the
                  tent of Thundercloud, as her imperious master was called, was opened, and
                  Priscilla was led out, and conducted towards the fatal tree. Having arrived there,
                  her owner made one more effort to obtain her consent to become his companion, and
                  preside over the domestic arrangements of his wigwam. He pointed to the young
                  warriors with their tomahawks and bows, and told her that they were only waiting
                  for a word from him to pounce upon her like so many wolves upon a helpless
                  fawn—that they had assembled to assist in her tortures, and unless she complied
                  with his wishes, he would give command for the horrid sport to begin.
               Nothing daunted by the dreadful array around her, the noble girl still repulsed
                  his offer.
               "I will never be your wife. It is not right for a daughter of the pale faces to
                  marry one of the red men of the forest. Choose a companion from your own tribe,
                  and I shall be willing to continue your servant."
               "I choose you," said Thundercloud; "you must marry me or die. What say you?"
               "I say, as I have from the first, that I can never comply with your request. My
                  trust is in the Great Spirit, who made the sun, and moon, and earth; and remember,
                  if you kill me, that almighty Being will be angry with you, and will torment you
                  forever. I look to him for deliverance."
               He pushed her rudely from him towards the young warriors, who were waiting with
                  impatience for their colloquy to end, and then strutted off towards the
                  distinguished visitors, who were sitting at a considerable distance, under a tent
                  which had been erected for their special accommodation.
               Priscilla was now seized, and tightly bound to the tree. The young braves then
                  amused themselves by casting at her their tomahawks, to see how near to her head
                  they could fasten their weapon in the tree, without actually hitting her. It was
                  an amusement at which they were extremely skilful. Several of the tomahawks came
                  whirling through the air, and as they entered the tree, cut from her head one of
                  her beautiful black ringlets. Others entered the tree immediately above her head.
                  Occasionally they would strike her garments; and one came so close as to wound her ear, causing the
                  blood to flow freely over her face and neck, like a crimson veil.
               During this dreadful ordeal the captive was engaged in prayer. Her confidence in
                  her Maker was unshaken. She prayed for herself, that deliverance might come—for
                  her friends, whom she expected never to see again—for her tormentors, that they
                  might be forgiven of their cruelty, and might become the followers of the Saviour.
                  No cry, no complaint escaped her.
               When the sport with the tomahawks had continued sufficiently long, they resorted
                  to their bows and arrows, and amused themselves by placing her small Bible, which
                  had always been her constant companion, upon her head, and shooting it off. When
                  wearied of this, they began to pile fagots around her, to consume her in a slow
                  fire. Priscilla watched all these movements with calm fortitude. She expected to
                  die. She saw no way of escape except by union with one whom her soul loathed. She
                  continued, however, to warn them, to talk to them about God and Christ, heaven and
                  hell. She said she would meet them again at the day of judgment, when they would
                  be called to account for their cruelty towards her, and exhorted them to repent of
                  all their sins, and prepare to meet the Great Spirit.
               During the preparation for this auto da fe, the
                  medicine bag and amulet of Omao had been removed from her neck, and had passed
                  from one to another as an object of curiosity. It was examined by the Indians,
                  especially by the young men, with much apparent interest.
               When the arrangements for the dreadful holocaust were all made—the prisoner being
                  bound to the tree, and the fuel heaped around her ready to be kindled—Thundercloud
                  left his distinguished guests, and approached her, to renew once more his
                  revolting proposal. With a flaming pine knot in his hand, he stood before her, and
                  promised her instant deliverance if she would consent to be his wife, but if not,
                  "I will touch you," said he, with a demoniac expression of countenance, "with this
                  torch, and change you into smoke and ashes. What say you?"
               The victim was silent; she could not utter a word. She was not certain of its
                  being right for her to sacrifice her life for such a reason. She had some scruples
                  of conscience, besides dreading the fire. It seemed to approximate too nearly to
                  suicide. Yet the conditions of deliverance were so odious—to be the bride of a savage, with
                  the pledge of a perpetual wild life in the forest—that she knew not what to say.
                  Her destiny hung upon the word she was about to utter. What should it be? Alas!
                  she knew not. Thundercloud became enraged at her silence, touched the torch to the
                  fagots, and then walked slowly away, taking with him the medicine bag and charm,
                  which had been handed to him by one of the young braves whom he passed. In a few
                  moments the smoke and sparks were circling round the head of the captive. All
                  kinds of taunts and gibes were poured into her ear by the young Indians, though
                  those who were the best acquainted with her kept silent, and looked upon the
                  horrid scene with countenances sad and solemn. Gladly would they have delivered
                  her if they had dared to interfere; but the stern customs of their tribe forbade.
                  Priscilla behaved with heroic fortitude. She lifted her eyes heavenward, and
                  prayed,—
               "O, Father, send deliverance; if not, Lord Jesus, into thy hands I commend my
                  spirit."
               Just as the flames had reached her thin garments, and were making rapid headway
                  towards her sensitive flesh, and whilst many of the young, men were leaping and
                  dancing around the stake, with violent and frightful gesticulations and grimaces,
                  accompanied by those unearthly yells which Indians only know how to utter, the
                  distinguished sagamore from a distance, who had been sitting with the chiefs and
                  elders of this tribe, suddenly started from his place, and, contrary to all rules
                  of Indian decorum, rushed towards the stake, dashed through the circle of dancing
                  braves like a madman, with his hands and feet scattered the burning fagots from
                  the captive, and then severed the, cords that bound her arms, and that fastened
                  her to the tree. Instantly the character of the whole scene was changed. The
                  dancing was abandoned. The Indians who had with them their weapons immediately
                  bent their bows, and placed an arrow upon the string; those who had not their arms
                  ran to their tents, and obtained them. The whole tribe was thrown into the highest
                  state of confusion and excitement. If a war party of their energy had suddenly
                  sent a shower of arrows amongst them, it would not have created greater
                  consternation. Whilst the attention of the warriors was directed towards this
                  strange chief, who had dared, in such a high-handed manner, to interrupt their
                  proceedings, and whilst a violent dispute was in progress between him and
                  Thundercloud, in which the whole company pany was interested, and which it was expected would result in a bloody fight,
                  attention was entirely diverted from Priscilla herself. All had fled from the
                  fatal tree. One of the wives of her owner, to whom the captive had rendered many
                  acts of kindness, seeing this, threw over her an old skin robe, and then seizing
                  her by the arm, hurried her off to the tent, unopposed by any one. Here Priscilla
                  hastily clothed herself. The friendly squaw then conducted her down a shelving
                  bank of rocks to a brook, and, after giving her general directions how to proceed,
                  told her she was now free, and must take care of herself. She then went back to
                  the Indians to assist in the confusion, and, if possible, to prevent their pursuit
                  of Priscilla.
               The strange chief, who had so unexpectedly interfered in the captive's behalf, was
                  Omao. He had visited this tribe for the purpose of having a friendly understanding
                  respecting certain hunting grounds, which were in dispute between them; and when
                  Priscilla's master, after lighting the fire with his pine knot, returned from the
                  stake with the medicine bag and amulet, Omao instantly recognized them as his, and
                  hence his immediate interference in the captive's behalf.
               It was a long time before the whole matter could be explained to the enraged
                  Thundercloud; and when it was, he was not satisfied. Still, as Omao appeared to be
                  governed by a high sense of honor, and made liberal offers of restitution for what
                  he had done, the angry chief, who knew he had nothing to gain from Priscilla, at
                  last became pacified.
               "Bring the pale face here," said he. But she was not to be found. She had made
                  good her escape before she was missed. Will she find her way home?
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LVIII.
               A HASTY FLIGHT.
               THE horrid scenes which we have narrated in the preceding chapter transpired a
                  number of days before the hasty flight of Stephen from the intolerant settlement
                  at Boston. We now return, to follow the adventures of the persecuted young
                  Baptist. After crossing over the narrow neck, which united the peninsula with
                  Roxbury, he entered the woods, and concealed himself till night. He was fearful of
                  being seen by some one who might report him to the magistrates and secure his
                  apprehension. After the shadows of the evening had fallen, and covered all the
                  landscape like a dark pall, he left the place of his concealment, and cautiously
                  proceeded on his journey. Not knowing the exact course to take, in a short time he
                  lost his way, and wandered about in the darkness for hours, not knowing whither he
                  went. In the morning, he found he had made but little progress in the right
                  direction.
               Still he pressed on. Instead of reaching Providence on the second day, as he had
                  hoped to, he found himself on the third day far to the north-west of it. The small
                  amount of food which he had taken with him became exhausted, and he had to resort
                  to his gun to obtain a supply of game. After finishing his rude supper that
                  evening, he knelt and prayed, and then laid himself down by the side of a
                  prostrate tree, with his head upon his small bundle for a pillow, and soon fell
                  asleep. He was aroused from his slumbers by the joyous birds, who were making the
                  dim old woods echo and re-echo to the brilliant notes of their early matins.
                  Arising from his rustic couch, our lonely traveller drew from his pocket a small
                  Bible, and after reading a portion of the Epistles, appropriate to his present
                  condition, he knelt and poured out his soul before his Maker. He prayed for the
                  friends whom he had left behind, and who were exposed to the cruel treatment of
                  the government; for his persecutors, that the truth respecting the design and mode
                  of the ordinances of the gospel might be clearly unfolded to them, and that their
                  hearts might be softened towards those from whom they differed. He prayed for his
                  parents beyond the sea. He did not forget Priscilla. Indeed, she had been in his
                  thoughts more during this solitary
                  journey through the woods of Massachusetts, than for a long time before. He
                  besought the Lord, if she were yet living, that he might learn of her residence,
                  once more enjoy her companionship, and that Heaven's richest blessings might
                  descend upon her.
               After his devotions, he made a hearty breakfast upon some fresh game which he had
                  brought down with his gun, and then resumed his march. After rapid travelling all
                  day, he ascended an eminence just as the sun was sinking in the west. Great was
                  his joy as he saw, but a few miles off, its last rays, lingering, like friends
                  unwilling to depart, around the little settlement of Providence. He hastened on,
                  and in a short time received from Roger Williams, the father of the colony, a
                  cordial greeting. The venerable man, being accustomed to entertain strangers, soon
                  provided him with a substantial supper; after which the evening was spent in
                  Stephen's relating minutely all the events which had occurred in Boston, in
                  connection with the recent persecutions. Mr. Williams was deeply interested in the
                  narrative. He knew from personal experience what it was to suffer for conscience
                  sake, and therefore he deeply sympathized with his young brother.
            
            
               CHAPTER LIX.
               AN UNEXPECTED SCENE.
               LATE in the evening, an Indian called at the house of Roger Williams.
               "Ah, Lightfoot, I am glad to see you," said Mr. Williams; "come in and sit
                  down."
               "No," replied the copper-colored son of the forest; "I only come to ask if you
                  'member a young girl lost from New Haven some years 'go?"
               "What was her name?" asked Williams.
               "Silla, I tink, and Eton to it."
               "Yes, yes; Priscilla Eaton. I remember it well, and the anguish, too, of her
                  parents, when they learned she was drowned."
               "She no drown," said Lightfoot.
               "Not drowned! Did they not find her basket and bonnet by a pond?"
               "Yes; but she no drown. She led away a prisoner. I knowd it when I followed her
                  trail to the pond. I see more track dan her foot make."
               What then, Lightfoot?" asked Mr. Williams liams, who believed, from the lateness of this call, and from the manner of the
                  Indian, that he was in possession of important information.
               "What den? Why, me fine her to-day, when hunting," replied Lightfoot.
               Stephen, who had listened to this colloquy with the deepest interest, anxiously
                  asked, as he heard this last announcement,—
               "Was she dead or alive?"
               "She was alive and lost; and asked where de white men lived."
               "And why did you not bring her here?" asked Stephen, in emphatic tones of voice,
                  in which there was a blending of grief and anger. The Indian, not accustomed to
                  that stern mode of address from the colonists, calmly looked at the young man, but
                  deigned no answer. Stephen was tortured with suspense.
               "Did you answer her question, Lightfoot?" mildly asked Roger Williams.
               "I did better," was the Indian's reply; but before he proceeded farther, the door
                  again opened, and two females entered, one of whom was plainly an Indian squaw. It
                  was the wife of Lightfoot. The other was a young woman, from whose appearance it
                  was difficult to tell whether she was a native or not. She was of a dark
                  complexion, with long black hair; and though she was clothed in embroidered skins,
                  yet they were not thrown on loosely, in Indian style, but were cut somewhat to her
                  form, after the fashion of the English. They were soiled and torn, and had the
                  appearance of hard usage. As soon as she was fairly in the room, she hastily
                  approached Mr. Williams, and, seizing his hand between hers, exclaimed, with deep
                  emotion,—
               "O sir, I rejoice to see a white face once more!"
               "Indeed; and are they then so scarce where you have lived?" replied he.
               "I have not seen a white person for years," said she, "and feared I should never
                  see one again. But the Lord hath been better to me than my fears."
               "Who are you, my friend, and where are you from?" kindly inquired Mr. Williams.
                  Stephen's eyes had been fastened upon the young woman, as if he were fascinated,
                  ever since she first entered the room. There was something in her features and
                  tones of voice, which awakened old associations; and when she answered Mr.
                  Williams, saying,—
               "My name is Priscilla Eaton, and I have just escaped from a dreadful captivity,"
                  it was to him like a clap of thunder
                  from a cloudless noonday sky. Springing to his feet, he placed himself directly in
                  front of her, and asked in a tremulous tone of voice,—
               "Priscilla, don't you know me?"
               The astonished girl looked and looked, but replied not.
               "Don't you know me? I am Stephen—Stephen Williamson."
               The two young friends rushed into each other's arms, and gave vent to their
                  feelings in a flood of tears. So unexpected, so singular was their meeting, that
                  to both of them it seemed more like a dream than a reality. Mr. Williams and the
                  Indians looked on with astonishment, not knowing what this outburst of emotion
                  signified.
               "You seem to be old friends," said the venerable missionary.
               "We are," replied Stephen; "but it is a long time since we last met. We were
                  children then;" at the same time wiping the tears from his eyes.
               "I thank God that your meeting has occurred under my roof. I love to see the young
                  happy."
               After the first gush of feeling was over, Priscilla inquired,—
               "Are my parents yet living?"
               "They are," said Stephen; "and, Providence permitting, you will soon see
                  them."
               So many questions were to be answered, and so much to be related on both sides,
                  that conversation was continued till late into the night, when, after an earnest
                  thanksgiving from the beloved missionary, all retired till morning.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LX.
               HOMEWARD JOURNEY.
               IT is not necessary to describe minutely the details of Priscilla's flight from
                  the Iroquois. It must be sufficient to say that it involved haste, caution,
                  stratagem, anxiety, and fatigue. At first she concealed herself by day, and
                  travelled only at night, in order to avoid apprehension in case she were pursued.
                  Afterwards, when she supposed it safe, she travelled by day, and rested during the
                  darkness of the night. She ascended hills, traversed valleys, forded brooks,
                  floated across rivers upon logs bound together by withes, and threaded her way
                  through forests which had never been penetrated by a white person before. Her food
                  consisted of fruits, berries, nuts, and roots, which, during her captivity, she
                  had learned could be eaten with safety. This was a subject to which, from the
                  first of her enslavement, she had devoted special attention. As she had always
                  contemplated an escape by flight, she had been particular to observe, on all
                  occasions, the kinds of natural productions, especially the fruits and roots,
                  which the Indians used for food. She was at no loss, therefore, to find enough on
                  which to subsist during her journey homeward.
               She had noticed at the time she was carried off that the general direction which
                  her kidnappers pursued was north-west. She therefore, on her escape, followed a
                  south-easterly direction as nearly as she could. Her impression was, that if she
                  could reach the sea, it would not be difficult to learn from some friendly native
                  whether she was to the north or south of the English settlements; and then, by
                  following the direction of the coast, she could easily find one of them, from
                  which she could probably communicate with her parents or uncle. Fortunately, she
                  fell in with an Indian who could speak English; and when she found that he was
                  friendly to the whites, and that he was willing to conduct her to the nearest
                  colony, she regarded it as a special providence. It was not long before she
                  learned that her guide was well acquainted with the story of her mysterious
                  disappearance, and had followed her trail to the pond in search of her. After
                  reaching the settlement, her guide left her in his own wigwam to take some
                     simple fare, which she greatly
                  needed, whilst he hastened to the house of the good missionary, whom he loved as a
                  father, to reveal his happy discovery. He was soon after followed, as we have
                  seen, by his wife and delivered captive, when the two long-separated friends were
                  once more brought together.
            
            
               CHAPTER LXI.
               A SATISFACTORY BARGAIN.
               So soon as it was known among the Iroquois that the prisoner had escaped,
                  Thundercloud gave immediate orders for her pursuit.
               "Strike the trail of the pale face, and bring her here like light. There is fire
                  enough left to send her in smoke to the clouds."
               "Stop, stop," said Omao; "be not too quick. Let me pay for her escape."
               "Hold!" cried Thundercloud to the young braves, who had started in pursuit of
                  Priscilla like yelping hounds after the frighted fawn; "hold! she cannot get far
                  to-night. We will hear the offer of the stranger, and if it is not enough, you
                  shall seek her to-morrow; and then," continued he, in menacing tones, "whoever
                  interferes with our doings shall be sent to the hunting grounds of the red men, on
                  the other side of the dark river."
               The negotiation went on. Omao's first offer was not accepted. Thundercloud was
                  angry, and his demands were large.
               
               "Give me fifty yards of wampum peague, and fifty dried deer skins, and the pale
                  face may flee unpursued. Not a single red skin shall track her. Say no, and
                  to-morrow she shall burn as surely as fire can be kindled."
               As Omao was determined to prevent the pursuit of Priscilla, he accepted the
                  proposed conditions, and so closed this whole affair.
               Priscilla was not pursued. If she had been, she would no doubt have been
                  discovered, taken back, and put to death by slow fire.
               A trivial kindness to an unfortunate Indian in her uncle's house, years before,
                  was, in this remarkable manner, the means of saving her from a most horrid
                  death.
            
            
               CHAPTER LXII.
               GREAT JOY.
               A FEW days after the arrival of Priscilla at Providence, the boat containing her
                  parents made its appearance.
               Great was their joy at meeting. Many were the expressions of delight and
                  thanksgiving which fell from their lips.
               "O, the goodness of God, the goodness of God!" exclaimed the mother, almost insane
                  with joy. "My lamb has returned to the fold, my bird has come back to its
                  nest!"
               "Yes," responded her husband, "the Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we
                  are glad."
               It was a day of joyous excitement throughout the whole colony. Priscilla had to
                  relate again and again her history; no part of which was more interesting to her
                  parents than her self-consecration in the retired grove by the lake at New
                  Haven.
               "O, how often," said she, "have I thought of that hissing serpent! Why did I not
                     take the alarm? And that spider,
                  too; many and many a time, when I have been devising plans of escape, did I derive
                  encouragement from the poor fly. I thought it was the symbol of myself. Like that
                  weak and harmless insect, I had been taken and carried off by a cruel and powerful
                  enemy. The fly escaped—why could not I?"
               "You have, you have, my dear!" the mother would interrupt. "You have escaped like
                  a bird from the fowler; the snare is broken, and the bird has escaped."
               It was not difficult after this for Priscilla and Stephen to come to an
                  understanding respecting their deep personal interest in each other.
               The consent of the parents was a matter of course. They rejoiced in the
                  opportunity of regarding him as a son who had saved their boy from the water, and
                  who was a fellow-sufferer with them, for the truth's sake.
               In a few months the two attached friends were united in the sacred bonds of
                  matrimony. And as Priscilla harmonized in her religious views with Stephen, they
                  were both, like Zachariah and Elizabeth, found walking together in all the
                  commandments and ordinances blameless; no one daring, under the wise and tolerant
                  erant government of Roger Williams, to molest them or make them afraid.
               Stephen found no difficulty in obtaining employment. His father, after recovering
                  from the displeasure which was awakened when he first heard of the conduct of his
                  son, was pleased to consign to him large quantities of goods, which he sold at
                  fair profits to the natives and the colonists. He thus acquired a comfortable
                  competency, and lived in great happiness with the friend of his youth.
               With reference to the other characters of our story, it must suffice to say, that
                  Mrs. Strangger, by her inquisitive and loquacious habits, became exceedingly
                  unpopular. Suspicions were excited against her. It was said that strange lights
                  were seen, and mysterious noises heard about her house at night. Children were
                  forbidden to purchase articles from her little store. She was shunned, as a leper.
                  Under the excitement of anger at what she considered such unkind treatment, she
                  predicted that judgments would fall upon the people. These were construed into
                  threats; and if, soon after, any calamity did happen, she was suspected of having
                  something to do with it.
               One morning a few highly valued sheep, which had but recently been imported
                     from England, and which had
                  frequently leaped over the fence into her garden, giving her much trouble, were
                  found dead. It was soon rumored that she had bewitched them. This increased public
                  odium against her to such a degree, that she was obliged to leave the colony
                  secretly, and in great haste, to escape apprehension and trial. It was not known
                  that in a swamp, near her house, grew a species of low laurel, which was poisonous
                  to sheep, and that the eating of this had produced the fatal results that were
                  attributed to her power of witchery.
               The unfortunate woman passed into the jurisdiction of Plymouth colony, where she
                  lived and died in comparative retirement.
               It was not long after the flight of the Eatons, those Puritan Baptists who, having
                  escaped the persecutions of the establishment in England, found their condition
                  but little improved under the intolerant proceedings of the standing order of
                  Massachusetts—it was not long after their exodus from Boston, before Strongfaith
                  Bates and a number of others who had embraced similar sentiments, being obliged in
                  like manner to flee from Massachusetts, placed themselves under the same discreet
                  and liberal government of Providence, where they found perfect freedom to worship
                  God, and observe the ordinances according to their own convictions of truth and
                  duty.
               Our narrative is now finished;—and if it should be the means of creating, or
                  increasing, in any mind, a repugnance to the union of church and state; of
                  deepening the love of religious liberty; of showing the importance of perfect
                  toleration of religious opinions; of impressing upon the conscience and the heart
                  the great truth that the Bible, and the Bible only, should be our guide in matters
                  of faith and practice, or of diffusing correct views respecting Christian
                  experience, and the right observance of the initiatory ordinance of the gospel, it
                  will not have been written in vain.
