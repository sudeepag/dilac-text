            TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN OF ILLANNOY, THE LOFTIEST OF LIVIN' STATESMEN,
               RENOUND ALIKE FOR HIS GREAT MILENTARY TALONS. HIS FIRM ADHEARANCE TO
               THE CONSTITOOSHIN, AND FIDELITY TO HIS INAUGERASHIN OATH, THIS WURK IS
               AFFECKSHINATELY INSKRIBED BY
            
               THE AUTHOR.
            
         
         
            
            PUBLISHER'S NOTE.
            The orthographical eccentricities exhibited in the following letters, including the
               variety of ways in which the same words are spelled in different parts of the
               correspondence, show that the writer was guided by no fixed rules of his own in his
               extraordinary (and it may be added unconscious) departures from the dicta of the
               dictionaries.
            The world has been laughing for years at the queer spelling and quaint phraseology of
               the DISBANDED VOLUNTEER; but, underlying all this, shrewd, homely philosophy, and
               biting sarcasm, constitute the chief merit of his letters. Some of them seem almost
               prescient when read by the light of events that have occurred since they first
               appeared in print.
         
         
            PREFACE.
            The friends that hes overperswaded me to hev the ensooin littery perduckshins bound
               up in buck form for the bennyfit of our common kentry, insists on my ritin a Preeface
               to them; and the publisher, who is naturally ankshus that the wurk should be
               proffertable to hisself, as well as to sosity, hes reckwested me to interdose it with
               a serious of prelimendary remarks, in my best vain. Heving allus ben uste to rite
               onpremeditated, on the subjestin of the moment, Ime rayther afeard that in attemptin
               to spred myself, I shall run sum risk of a kullaps. I hev knowd setch misfortens
               happen to men of the most brilyant genus, when they tried to sore beyant the lenth of
               nater's tether.
            Howsever, I shell do my best. Webster's Dickshinary—a vollum witch I hev sairtched
               and studded more keerfully than enny uther publicashin goin, eggsept the
               skripters—ses the objeck of a Preeface is to state the mane desine of the wurk. Ef I
               am not mistaken in the vews of my publisher, the mane desine of this wurk is to make
               munny. Leastways, that's his desine.
            But the orther, I am proud to say, is indooced to cast the follerin lines afore the
               wurld by a hyer porpus. My life, as the kentry is awar, hes ben full of wunderful
               vississytoods, from the time I was Disbanded, arter the Mexican war, to the present
               crysis. First I made my pile in the airly days of Californy, shuvellin up gold amung
               the Digger Injens; then I pardizzypated in the revolushinary moovements in Payris;
               arterwards I figgered around a wile in London; next I visited Constantinopul, and
               took sarvis with the late Grand Senior, Addle-Mushed, onder whose banner I fit in the
               Crymean war; subsekwently I emmygrated to Australy, and made considabul addishins to
               my pile from its oderiferous deposits; later I tuck up my abode in New York, and
               familiarised myself with the manners and customs of its eggstrodinary popalashin;
               still later I went on an
               eggscursion to Springfield, Illanoy, and finally I brort up at Washington, whar I
               hang out at present.
            The happyest event in my life occurd at Springfield, Illanoy. Thar I found a frend of
               the tallest kind. Need I say that frend was ABRAHAM LINCOLN. That poplar Idle hed
               jest ben chosen President by the vice of the peeple. From that hour we hev ben wun
               and insuperable. He hes ben my Valentine and I hev ben his Arson. Demon and Pithyass
               was not more affeckshinately united. I accumpaned him to the Capitol and hev ben his
               confidenshal adviser ever senst he assoomed the rains of pour and began to shower the
               blessins of good guverment upon this faverd land. I never flatterd him, and he nose
               it. Jelus Constitooshinal Advisers hev endevored to make breeches atwixt us, but it
               warnt in thar boots to do it. We hev hed our tiffs, and I hev sumtimes spoken my mind
               about him in my curryspondence, with a straitforrardness that would hev subjeckted
               ennyboddy else to a letter de catch it, and a melankoly emprisonment in
               Fort Laugheryet. "But no," sed his Eggsellency, "he means well, and I won't hev him
               mislested."
            I hev called this vollum "The War Letters of a Disbanded Volunteer", bekase the most
               of the epistols hes ben written senst the war commenst, tho it will be seen that they
               begin inmediently arter the eleckshin of my illustrus frend. The reader will notis
               thars a brake in the curryspondence. It stops at April 4, 1861, and runs on agen from
               July 4 of the same year. Doorin the hihaters I was engaged in activ pershoots, and
               hed no time for letteratoor. But the moment it was possabul I returnt to Abraham, who
               tuck me back with rapter to his bizness and buzzum. In conclushin, I would say that
               my idee in publershin the letters in a collected form is, to place the karrickter and
               services of that Destingwished Statesman in thar troo light afore my kentrymen, with
               a vew to biass and inflewence thar feelins and judgments, when they go to the poles,
               in November next.

                  SPRINGFIELD, ILLAYNOY, Janurary 80, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Times:
               
               I notiss that in answerin a curryspondent, you locat me in the Centril Floury
                  Kingdum, assistin to give the natives rats. "Well," ses I, on readin the remark,
                  "ef that aint purty kool, Ime a teapot. Here," ses I, "hes the Britishers and the
                  French ben a plunderin the Chiny pallises and hairem ad
                     libertine, and Ime sot down as hevin ben a backin and abettin on em."
                  I dont purtend to be no grate shakes of a morolist, but you shudder node me
                  better'n that. Onjest slorter is a serious bizness, and Ive allus cunsiderd the
                  alliegashuns of the allies agen the Chinees a shamful subterfudge. The real
                     casus belly was becase the Chinee dienasty sed the
                  poppylashin shuddent be pisened with extract of poppies. They diddent deny that
                  the peeple was too thick on the ground, but they went ded agen reducin the
                  nashinal senses with lodlum. England, hevin the drug for sale, immediently
                  purseeded to give em fits, and bein a Christian nashin, with all the moddern
                  improovements, she suckseded at last, with the help of Providence and the Hero
                     of Sulphurino, in takin the Celestil
                  city. The hull consarn reminds me of the latter eend of Fair Rosymound, as was cut
                  off in her prime with a dillyterus drug. She was respeckfully rekwested to take
                  her chice atween a pint of proosic assid and a pint of a pineyard, and preferd the
                  former. Thar was this difference, howsever, in favor of Rosymound: she got off
                  with swallerin the pisin, while the onfortnit Chinees hed to take the steal and
                  the pisin both.
               It warnt the clene thing, eddyturs, to mix me in with setch disrighteous dooins.
                  But, prehaps, arter all, you oney ment to wake me up, and get me to resoom my
                  epistolary correspondence. Ef so, let byguns be byguns.
               I spose, on seein the date of this letter, you'll say to yourselves, "What ken the
                  venabul old cuss be up to in the prayery state?" Well, Ime on a speshil mishin of
                  my own. Ime studdyin "old Abe." He bleves in me, and I can tell you as much about
                  his idees as he nose himself, and mebbe more. I call on him every day, rain or
                  shine, and things he woodent open his hed about to Thirlo Weed is freely disgust
                  atween us. Ses he to me, the other day, "D. V."—that's his koncise way of
                  shortenin my incog. cognomen—"D. V.," ses he, "do you reely think the hull South
                  will disune and secess?"
               "That depends, Lincoln," says I, for I warnt agoin to commit myself too
                  suddently.
               He peered berried in refleckshin for a few moments, and then remarkt:
               "Woodent extendin Mason and Dickerson's line from Cape Cod to Cuby satisfy em, or
                  must it be the pairalel of 2:40 from Conneticut to Congo river?"
               "Abe," I respondid, "you tork like a statesman, and wot's better, like a United
                  Statesman. The friends of Union look up to you. Thar cry is cumprommis."
               "Yas," ses he; "it's all very well to say cumprommis, but wot am I to promis?
                  That's whar the wedge binds. Here's all the ultree-black republicans threttenin me
                  with a gorilla warfare ef I suckum to the South, and the South threttenin to jerk
                  the presidenshil cheer from onder me onless I put it on thar platform."
               "Lincoln," ses I, "the oney chanst for you is a middle curse—the just
                     melee, as the French say. Dont buck agen Silly, and dont get snagged
                  on Caribadibs, but put your helium amidships, and drop a little goos-greece on the
                  ragin bellows as you pole along. Ef South Caroliny chewses to sow the wind and rip
                  the worldwind, let her rip. Jest you be guverned by the preposishins of the border
                  states, and they'll take keer the Union issent disconjuncted."
               Snatchin my hand with considabul emoshin, wile a saft expresshin cum over his
                  naterally hard phizmahogany, the old feller exclaimed, "Youre rite, D. V. I feel
                  youre rite—I feel it here," continued he, smitin his westcut; "but ef I foller
                  your advice and my own inklingashins, I shall be stickmatised as a doeface by all
                  deer frends as wants me to take the bull by the horns."
               "Not a bit of it," ses I—"thar bound to sale in your bote ennyhow, bein as
                  Congress is ded agen em and they hevent nowhars else to go. You jest cum out
                  rayshinal in favor of a fair cumprommis in black and white, and you'll nock the
                  disrupshinists hyer'n a kite."
               And I shuddent wonder ef he dun it. He seems to me to be of a flexibull and
                  cumpliant natur, without mutch back-bone to him—but that remanes to be seen.
               He studdies the Constitooshin aciduously, but hesent yet made up his mind what
                  constitoots treson. He ses "aid and comfort" is setch vaig frayseology, that he
                  can't get the hang of it. I bleve, howsever, he cunsidders runaway niggers
                  seezable under the claws tutchin fellers held to servis, and allows that the hed
                  of the guvernment should be guided by the fundymental basis. So you perceev that
                  peepul who insists as Abe hesent got beyond his a b, abs, in
                  pollytickle skience, is libellious no-nothins.
               The President eleck wishes me to go on to Washington with him, which I hev
                  consented, for I mistrust that sum of them eastern fannytix will play Hale Columby
                  with his prospecks, ef he's left to thar tender musses, without a troo frend at
                  his elbo.
               Whenever I ken let you no wot's uppermost in his mind, without a breech of honor,
                  you may expeck to larn sumthin of Old Abe's sayins and dooins from

                     Star of the West, who is so soon to illuminate the national horizon. Mr.
                     Lincoln cannot do better than cultivate the acquaintance of that eccentric man,
                     whose honesty is considerably more
                     reliable than his orthography, and who can read human nature like a book,
                     although he makes wild work with the grammar and dictionary. It gives us
                     pleasure to learn that the President-elect keeps a stiff upper lip, in spite of
                     the portentous fog that lowers around him, but which we sincerely hope he will
                     see through. There is nothing like a cheerful frame of mind in the midst of

                  SPRINGFIELD, ILLANOY, February 6, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Times:
               
               I spose youve heern that the incummin presidenshil incumberant puts out from this
                  place on Monday next, to take the eggsecative cheer at the sete of guvment. Not
                  apprehendin ennything serious in Merryland, he refuses a milentary escort from his
                  sucker and hoosyour frends. He will travil as ushil by rail, and with no other
                  defensiv weeping but a maul and a wood ax. It is understood that sartain paytryots
                  as desines to sarve their kentry under his patternage, and tharfor naterally takes
                  an interest in the sekurity of thar princypal, hes sent him a shirt of male; but
                  bein a man of irun nerves and full of grit, he declines the addishin to his
                  wardrub, and will ware cotton next his skin, in complyment to the leadin staypull
                  of the South. Ankshus to identify hisself with the intrests of that rejin, he hes
                  put hisself on a strict regiment of South Caroliny rice and Louseanna lasses, and
                  is larnin to combust the Weed, in order to smoak the pipe of peace with Old
                  Virginny.
               The post offices here doos a lively bizness on old Abe's ackount. Rite in the
                  center of the eddifiz stands what is none as the Lincoln Letter Bin. It is about
                  twiste the bigness of an ornary hog troft, and six sorten fellers is continally
                  pitchin inter it nite and day. Mebbe it mought be discurridging to sum of the
                  orthurs of the missifs to no wot becums of thar stashinary—but I forbare. Suffisit
                  to remark that the lines doosent allus fall in plesent places. Being as frendly
                  with the President eleck as Demon and Pythiass, in the play, he sends me about
                  hafe a bushil of letters every mornin, and I larf tell I cry as I run my eyes over
                  em. If, as Douglas remarkt to his mother arter the peepul squelched him, "the post
                  of honor is the private's stashing," Abe's flatterers and parricides doosent see
                  it, for they all go in for being public ossifurs. Frinstince, all the littery
                  fellers as got out Lincoln Lives—and thars more of em than ever a cat had—wants to
                  be remunnyrated for thar talons outer the nayshunal puss. Over a hundred eddyturs
                  claims to hev ben the fust to hyst the Lincoln banner, and to hev waived it throo
                  the canvass and sported it at the poles with unflaggin zeal. Uppards of a thousand
                  Wide Awakes in New York and Philadelphy rekwires a fittin recompence for thar
                  onsleepin vigelense, and ninety Lincoln Minnit Men in Boston hes petishined to be
                  made night watches. Evry male delivery brings scores of solicitashins for
                  first-class births, and ef hafe the demands for guvment pap was complide with, the
                  treshury woodent be long in a solvent state. You'd be rayther tuck aback to see
                  sum of the dockaments from the big bugs of the party, full of the contemptablest
                  kinder inderogatories, and meener by chorks than enny beggin letter as was ever
                  handed to you by a travelin mendacant. Sum fokes as is cunsidered high-minded
                  statesmen by the No-Nothins, would be cut down suddently, and nuthin shorter, ef
                  the nature of thar aspirashins was genally none. I name no names, but its lucky
                  for sartin parties that Old Abe turned the manyscrips over to an onabull man.
               The incummin eggseckativ, altho aperiently firm, is of a comic nater and fond of a
                  joak. Sum considder him stiff and lofty, but he hes no objeckshin to unbend when
                  he sits down for a soshil evenin with a frend. Oridgenal cannondrums is his fort.
                  Ses he to me the other night, as we was takin our old rye together—he drinks rye
                  coffy and me rye whisky—"D. V.," ses he, "why is the hed of the
                  nashin like no uther hed in the nashin?" I tride to wurk it, but it was nogo, so I
                  gin it up. "Why, you donkey," ses he, "bekase he goes in for four 'ears." Purty
                  smart that, Warn't it now? I told him so, and by way of keepin up the fire, axed
                  him why he was like Robin Hood's coat. He caved in on that, and I explaned that he
                  was like Robin Hood's coat bekase he was Lincoln green. He sed he couldent see
                  that or enny other man. Arter mewsing awhile, he inkwired if I could inform him
                  how he made his way to distinkshin. I replide, "Prehaps by chanst." "No," ses he,
                  with a smild that shode his opin countenance to grate advantidge; "I axed it." And
                  then he larfed till I thort he'd split. Rekiverin hisself, he told me he'd got a
                  fust chop riddle in his hed for Bucannon, and he ment to let him hev it on the steps of the
                  Capitol, jest before he swore in. "Spit it out," ses I. "Here goes," ses he, and
                  deconed it out as rollers: "Why is Abraham Lincoln likely to be a silent
                  president?"
               "Do you think Old Buck'll give that up?" ses he.
               "Ef he gesses it," I ansered, "his organ of farseeshusness is bigger'n mine."
               "Wall," he broke in, "I'll tell you why Abraham Linkin is likely to be a silent
                  president: it's bekase he intends to avide openin his mouth onnessarily, for feer
                  he should put his foot in it."
               Whool say the old rail-splitter is a fool arter that?
               I bleeve I menshend in my last that the venabull flat boteman hed invited me to
                  accumpany him to the Deestrict of Columby. We shall go throo Sinsinnaty, Buffylo,
                  Albany, Harrassburg, and Bawltomore, and mebbe drap in at Philadelfy and New York,
                  ef we take a noshin. Onless attact and disbursed by the enemy, on the rout, we may
                  be looked for at Washington about the 21st. Ef you desire it, I ken keep you fully
                  posted up in relashin to Old Abe's sayins and doins, and cetery, which as he is at
                  present the sinnershure of all eyes, I sppse will be interestin to your inquizitiv
                  readers.

                  COLUMBUS, February 13, 1861—11 P. M.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Times:
               
               As Richmound ses in the play, "Thus far inter the bowils of the land have we
                  propelled without impedament." No rox on the trax; no fatil blunderbushes fired at
                  us by suthern emiseries; no suttle pisin in the Hidesick and Mungoheeler; no
                  blowin up with infarnal mashins; no preconsartid snake-heds; no hissin
                  even—nuthin, in fack, but "Giv us yer hand, ole woodchuck!" "Three cheers fur the
                  Illanoy ripstaver!" "Make the chips fly outer the palmettos, old hoss!" and other
                  curteus expresshins, denotin a poplar favor in favor of the imminent sucker
                  statesman.
               It is onnesessary to giv you the particklers of our rout, witch hes ben a mity
                  triump. Everywhars whar Uncle Abe hes held a levy, he hes ben visited by as menny
                  peeple as could be wedged inter the rum. Nowhars hes he ben maultreated. His
                  orashins hes ben short, but moddist—the nub of em bein that he hes a harder ro to
                  ho than George Washington ever had, and that ef Providense will oney stiffen his
                  back-bone, and keep his hands from blisterin, he intends to ro it out in full, and
                  sow the seed of cverlastin peas and plenty in the futer.
               In this sitty, he gin his vews to the Legislatur with mutch applaws; and at the
                  bankwit this evening, at Guvner Denizen's, he made a speetch witch sumboddy
                  pronounst worthy of a Sissyrow. Never hevin heerd of Sissyrow, I inkwired whar he
                  haled from, and larned from a yung lawyir as sot neer me, that he was a favorit
                  stump speeker amung the Rummuns, who was finerly murdered for party resins while
                  on a jurney. I thort the illushin ominus. We hed a fine band of mewsishiners to
                  toot arter the toasts, and as the incummin President konkluded his harang, they
                  gin us, "Cease, rood Boreas, blusterin Railer," about as strong as brass could
                  blow it. Delikit compliment, warn't it? He felt it as setch, and reethin his
                  remarkabul feturs with smiles, retired to his pillar to dream, no dout, of the
                  high post that awates him at Washington.
               Airly to-morro mornin we start for the morril but bytoominus sitty of Pittsbug,
                  witch, I onderstand, is the smuttiest place in the United States. On Munday, ef
                  not afore, we shall sartainly be in Albany, whar Thirlo Weed, who is to meet us at
                  Buffylo, will overhawl the inaugurole, interdooce the New Public Funkshinary to
                  Guvner Morgan—who is no relashin, I onderstand, to Thirlo's former frend of that
                  name—and furnish a full programmar of the pollysee of the new guvment, with
                  direckshins how to wind it up, keep it goin, and run the mashin genally. Toosday,
                  I shall hope to tak you by the hand at the Astor Hous, whar we expeck tohang out,
                  on account of Dannil Webster hevin ben perlitely invited thar when he exclaimed to
                  an ongrateful kentry, "Whar shall I go?" Peeple as keeps hottels seldum shose so
                  mutch considerashin for exalted paytrotism in distress, and Old Abe thinks setch
                  devoshin oughter be encurridged ridged.
                  Still, we may go sumwhars else, arter all—everything depends on Thirlo Weed. Ime
                  told thars a peart struggil goin on atwixt him and Horris Greely as to witch shall
                  be privit tooter to the new President arter he takes the rains of pour. Mebbe both
                  on em may be mistaken, for the old feller stiffens up amazinly. He's not hafe as
                  week in the knees as I sposed he was; and arter he gits farely in the saddel, and
                  his feet in the sterrups, I shouldent wunder ef he cut up rusty with his would-be
                  gardeens, and relide on his own nolidge of the kuntry to make a winnin race.
               I spose evryboddy's curus about the Inaugurole. Well, from the extracks the
                  President eleck hes red to me, it's my blefe that, ef its promulgeated in its
                  present form, itul make considabul of a splurge. Prehaps I am precoshus in
                  referrin to it so long afore the forth of March; but thar can't be no harm in
                  sayin that it is aunty-coershin up to the handle. Ef the secesshinary stairs oney
                  pay thar doos, and render onto Seizer wot they've seized as doosent blong to em,
                  they kin play outer the Union from now ontil time immemoral, without ennybody
                  attemptin to interfeer in the fassinatin game; but ef they air fools enuff to
                  dekline these eesy condishins, then thar ports is to be blockheaded, thar males
                  cut off, and forces mustard to retaik the forts by a salt; This aint percisely wot
                  the dockyment ses, verb-at-him et let-her-at-him, but it's wot
                  the lawyers call the anymuss of it. Youd think, mebbe, from the
                  tone and tenner of this extrornary stait paper, that the riter plaist his hull
                  trust in Providense; but I persoom cannon, cutlashes, rifuls, and baganets is
                  mixed up with his relidjus confidense. I dont predicate that the speech will be
                  delivered jest as it reeds now; but Ime purty sartin that itul be in favor of
                  collectin the revenoos and gettin back the forts, and cetery, willy
                  nilly; and at the same time ded agen coershin. As we air to visit Philadelfy, I
                  shall reckamend the distingwished flat boatman to ax a Philadelfy lawyer ef he
                  doosent cunsidder setch a pairadocks a ridickalus slip, and kalkilated to spile
                  the hull consarn.
               Wot sort of a resepshin is the Tall Son of Illanoy to hev in New York, I wunder?
                  Sum of the party is afeared he'll be goost and groned, ef nuthin wus; but I've
                  offered to bet he'll be taken up Broadway in a opin bayrush, with four-in-hand,
                  and all the honors ushilly conseeded to illustrated stranngers. The wimmin,
                  without distinkshin of pollytix, will be at the winders and ballneys, waiving thar
                  drygoods. Ime sartain of that. When did they ever negleek the pockit handkercher
                  bizness on enny publick ockashin, wether it was in honor of a Black Rep. or a
                  Yaller Jap?
               You'll find old Abe considabully changed from what he was when the litthygrafts
                  was took in November. Just prevus to leaving, he tuck his ax and went for a few
                  days inter the woods, near Springfeeld, to recuperate, and he cum back as lively
                  as a shoat in akorn time. He ses cuttin and cordin allus refreshis his mentil
                  fackiltees, and speshilly at that seesin of the year, when the sap begins to rise.
                  Doorin the last few weeks he hes ben cultivatin whiskers, witch gives his visidge
                  the asspekt of a big hickory not with some moss onto it, and softens and releeves
                  the 'hardness of the outline. Arter all, the old wedge-driver isent so humly as he
                  mought be. He sartinly compares favably in that respeck with John Tyler, whose
                  extrornary beak was wunst pinted out to me in the paroquet of the Richmond
                  theayter.
               Hevin jest reseeved a messidge from the old man, to say that he wants five minnits
                  confidenshil talk with me prevus to goin to his bony repose, I must
                  dry up for the present, remainin, as formally,

                  PHILADELFY, February 22, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Times:
               
               Notwithstandin his onpresidented fateegs in your sitty, the poplar woodchopper
                  arove here in a tolably salubrus condishin. Bowing continnally to the vox
                     popyoulie hes bent his neck and made his backbone soar, but his
                  privit fizishin ses that his vertbray bray is not injerd, and that some
                  Pensylvany coal ile rubbed inter the lumber region will make him as
                  good as new. Not onderstandin doctor talk, I can't eggzacktly get the abuv throo
                  my har, but it's consolin to no that thars nuthin serius.
               Mrs. Lincoln—and a fine, harty speciment of a hole-soled western woman she is—is
                  delited with the attenshins paid her. Shes not overly pleased, howsever, with her
                  picter in the Triboon, whar she figgers as a short fat lady with a turnup nose and
                  thin lips. I consider the description a liebill, and I wouldent advise the
                  reporter to present hisself at the White House. Bob Lincoln, the eldest hop of the
                  Lincoln fammaly, is as lively as a bird. Nuthin in yure sitty tickled him so mutch
                  as Barnum's Mewseum. He ses, Finnyas and the big seal beats all natur, and the
                  hull fammaly is mutch amused and gratifide with the grate showman's callin him the
                  Prence of Rails.
               Abe and me hes hed considabul conversashin about the resepshin in New York. He
                  sed, this mornin, puttin his hand to his furhead, "I shall hold the peeple of the
                  Empire Sitty in grateful remembrance as long as memry holds her seat in this
                  distracktid globe;" and I calkilate he will. The old paytryit is in capitol
                  sperits, and fuller'n ever of his joaks and cannondrums. Last nite he sent for me
                  to spend a soshil hour with him aloan. I seen humor in his eye when I entered his
                  rum. Ses he, as soon as Ide ankered myself on wun side of a teeter
                     tete, and him on tuther—ses he, "D. V., old possum, why was the
                  demmyeratic pollytishins as wated on me in New York like sagashus
                  wood-choppers?"
               "Dunno," ses I; "mebbe bekase they brort their axes to grind."
               "Well," he remarkt, "they mought-I never thort o' that. But this is the anser:
                  Bekase they keerfully avoided knotty pints and goin agen the grain."
               Bein onwillin to be sposed dumb in the commic line, I gin him the follerin in
                  return:
               "Why was you and your fammaly, last Wensday, like the diseased Mexican volunteers
                  berried at New York with the honors of war?"
               Arter cojitatin sum time, the venabul old codger venterd a gess:
               "Prehaps," ses he, "bekase the poplous tuck thar hats off outer respeck to us as
                  we past."
               "No," I replide, "but bekase all your trunks was solely drawd down Broadway
                  sumounted by the Merican flag."
               He smiled coicdisendinly, and remarkt that he was gratifide to see the flag of his
                  country a wavin over his extensiv wardrub. It being now the grate wedge-driver's
                  turn to propound, he axed me why a presidenshil inaugurole was like enny other
                  auger-hole?"
               I told him probly on ackount of evryboddy bein able to see throo it.
               He kinder winshed at that, but immediently responded: "Bekase its a bore;" and I
                  dessay he gin utterance to the feelings of his hart, for he's orfully eggsersized
                  about that momentuous dockament.
               Hevin spent a few minits with his eyes fixt on the mirror over the mantil, starin
                  inter vacansy, he cum out with the subjined: "You no," ses he, "Mr. Hazard, the
                  gunpowder-man, as visited me in New York. Now, why is his privit residence as
                  danngerus as his powdermill?"
               "Mebbe bekase his wife's liabul to blo him up," ses I.
               "Rong agen," exclaimed the farseeshus railer; "its bekase both is equilly
                  Hazard-house."
               Bein now thuroly in the vain, he got off'sevral more, noways infearyour to the
                  foregoin.
               "When I leaned outer the Astor Hotel winder to bid the multitood good-by," ses he,
                  "why was I like an old Dutch house at Albany?"
               "Oh, I no," ses I, "you hed setch a remarkabul stoop."
               "D. V.," replide he, droring himself up, "you bark up the rong tree so frekwently,
                  that I begin to think yure next door to a niddiot. The resin why I favored an old
                  Dutch house at Albany was bekase I had my gabble eend to the street."
               "Wall," continued the old joaker, arter we'd finisht our larf, "just wun more and
                  then adoo. What aintshint eddyfiz do I most resembul?"
               Imaginin he was on the same track as afore I sed, "the Tower of Babble."
               "Gess agin," ses he.
               "Ho!" ses I, "mebbe the leanin tower, which I've heern tell projecks beyant the
                  senter of gravity."
               "Gess wunst more," was the response.
               But I deklined the responsability, admitten the questin was too deep and intrickit
                  for my stock of gumpshin.
               "Frend," ses he, looking as grave as a monymemnt, "the anshint eddyfiz I most
                  resembul is Noah's Ark, for Ime farely at sea, tossing about at the massy of
                  contendin elements and no land in sight.
                  I oney hope the fack similar may extend as fur as the duv, the
                  olive branch, and the ranebo of piece; but at present it looks more like
                  everything goin to pieces."
               The old man's face assoomed sitch a sorrowful aspeck, as he sed this, that I felt
                  it cum from the bottom of his sole, and with a corjal squeedge of the hand we
                  parted for the nite.
               I hevent thort it requizit to say mutch about the publick gloryficashins on our
                  rout, as the daly papers will give you in full all the nesessary details. Wot your
                  reeders want is to see behind the seens—to kontemplate the Grate Western in his
                  moments of relaxashin. I intend, tharfore, in this serious of letters, to present
                  him as he is by natur, when the pollytishins isent a bullyraggin of him.
               The resepshin here was a doublycate of that in New York. To-morrow, we shall reech
                  the fedral terrortory, and my nex communicashin will be from Washington. In the
                  meentime, e pluvius urum, and may we and our sun's suns behold
                  this glorious Union now and forever wun and invisibul.

                  WASHINGTON, March 1, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Times:
               
               When I rit last, little did I andizzypate that the grate timber splitter would nex
                  mornin be a rushing over the rails full split for his life, and belevin as nuthin
                  but bein ahed of time could prevent his bein launshed inter etarnity. Mind, I dont
                  say as his magnannymouse sperrit was decomposed by the prospeck of his own
                  humaside. Like Julus Siezer, he would hev gon to the capitol accordin to the
                  programmy, regardless of cunsperrators. and thar dadgers. But Abe luvs his wife
                  better'n Saezer luvd California, and hens the old cock yielded to her
                  eggsortations, and aperiently shode the white fether. Evry boddy admits now that
                  the cunspurracy was a fish story, and that he fled from a shadder. The 'mount of
                  it is, that sartain dimmycrats in Bawltomore—partickler friends of old Buck—wanted
                  to run a saw on the railocrats, so they coined this bit of bogus jest to put
                  Ginral Scott on a false cent. The hull turnt out percizely as the joakers ment it
                  should, and the Merrylanders hevent yet dun shakin thar sides over thar waggary.
                  "Lock's Moon Hokes " warn't a suckemastance to this remarkabul suck in.
               I did my best to perswade the illustrus wedge-driver not to bolt from Harrassburg,
                  and mought hey pervented the stampede ef I hed hed his privit ear longer; but the
                  wimmen bust in upon us, and swomped my argyments with a flood of tears. They
                  couldent hardly speak for gulpin and sobbin, and the hull burdin of thar cries
                  was—"Oh!-Oh!-Oh!-he'll be ass-ass-ass-ass sass-inated!"Never heerd setch an
                  affectin corus in all my life. I dont think I could hev sed no, ef I hed been in
                  Old Abe's place. But even at that meltin moment the naterally commic biass of his
                  mind shode itself.
               "D. V." ses he, in a horse whisper—for his vice was husky with emoshin—"D. V., why
                  am I in the same perdickyment now as if I was in the midst of the
                  conspurrators?"
               I couldent figger it out.
               "Why," ses he, stretchin his lips with a benine smile, "bekase Ime overcum with
                  menny weepins."
               Arter sum refleckshin I got at the nub of the joak, and guffawed slitely.
               When the veniabul Illannoyan gits on the commic trail he follers it up regardless
                  of everything. He couldn't stop hisself, notwithstandin the glummy nater of the
                  subjeck in hand.
               "Ken enny of you tell me," ses he, "why Ime like a wheel within a wheel?"
               Wun of the ladys subjested sumthin about his conneckshin with the commonwheel.
               "No," he resoomed, shakin his bed and winkin at me, "it's bekase Ime goin
                  incog."
               Encurridged by the larf at this wittysissum, he put the ensooin kwestin:
               "What steps shall I resort to on the forth of March to show the people my respeck
                  for the Constitooshin?"
               Several of the wimmin maid reply. Wun said, "No cumprommis with the disannullers
                  of the Union, Abe." Anuther thort the best corse would be to invite all the
                  leading traytors to Washington, and
                  string em up to the Pennsylvany avenoo poplars; and a third sed ef old Abe would
                  appint a nayshinal wimmens convention, the hull thing could be put throo in a
                  weak.
               The distinguished cannondrumist explaned. Ses he: "My frends, the fust steps I
                  shall resort to on the forth of March, to show my respeck for the Constitooshin,
                  will be the Capitol steps."
               I groaned laudably—I couldent help it—and, takin the old man's arm, led him into
                  the opin air, whar he sun rekivered, and became comparatively rayshinal.
               The inaugurole is finisht. On Monday itul oney be wuth two cents a coppy, but
                  menny a specklater would giv ten thousand dollars this minnit to hev sketch a
                  glans at it as I hed to-day. Altho my tung is tide as to particklers, I may
                  menshin that it will make sartin ultry-black republicans blastfeem. It is not
                  flowery, but oncommon Weedy. Ef it doosent make stox jump thars no jump too em.
                  Don't be tuck aback ef you hear sreeks in the Tryboon offis, nex dore, when they
                  git its meanin throo thar har. I tell you, consillyashin's the wurd from the
                  Capitol Hill next Munday—if it isent, you ken withdraw yure confidense from me for
                  ever more, Amen!
               I notis thars a hepe of gossip about the President eleck goin the rounds, most of
                  witch is liebills. Hevin kept a diaree of his moovments for sum time past, I speke
                  by the keard. The Dutchman as ses he emplies his hours of relaxshin in brushin his
                  own boots and takin grease pots outer his panterloons, doosent no the Sinsinnatus
                  of the west from a side o'lether. His ushil amusement wen to hum, was to supply
                  the famaly with wood, do the marketin, and pound beefstakes for breakfast with his
                  famous maul; but the oney recreashin he indulges in at present is wittlin slivers
                  of white pine into minatoor rails. He wittles and reflecks, and reflecks and
                  wittles, and wittles and joaks, and joaks and wittles. The tutch of timber's
                  necessary to bring out his idees. Setch is the consekense of bein raised in a
                  wooden kentry.
               The petishins for offis under the incummin administration, now on file, accordin
                  to the kalkilations of a member of the topografical engineers, would carpit the
                  entire districk of Columby, paper all the housen in Washington, and leave enuff to
                  make kites for all the children in the United States doorin the present seesin.
                  This is gratifyin.

                  [Again our correspondent has been closeted with "Old Abe", and again he has
                     derived "chunks of wisdom" from his oracular and somewhat jocular lips. We are
                     glad to learn that the President is in health and good spirits. Rail-splitting
                     and poling broadhorns may be considered light and pleasant recreations in
                     comparison with the mental anxiety and the wear and tear of temper which he is
                     fated to experience. Our correspondent's views of the inaugural are not those
                     generally entertained by the public, but he may be right,
                     nevertheless.—EDS.]
               
               
                  WASHINGTON, March 8, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Times:
               
               Altho the inaugurole was slitely mudified arter I saw it, to sweeten the ultrees,
                  it is, upon the hull, jest as I said, a consillytory commoonycashin. The koncludin
                  sentence about "mystic cords stretchin all over this broad land," is univarsally
                  regarded as a good wind up. The young ladees, I larn, is delited with the passidge
                  whar Old Abe ses he hes "an oath registered in Heven." It puts em in mind, they
                  say, of a similar remark in "Manfriday, or the Wun-handed Munk," "The Mistress of
                  Udolpho," "The Castel Specter," and uther rumantic tradijees and
                  mellow-drammers.

                  thar is in what he swore to arter he red that rigmayroll. He hed to take his Bible
                  oath to sport the laws, and that's purty mutch the hull nub of his anticedent
                  speetch. He couldent hardly be eggspected to say he intended to perjur hisself
                  with the sakrid vollum he was agoin to kiss starin him rite in the face.
               What'll be the end of it all the Lord abuv nose, and ime blamed sure neither the
                  fire-eaters nor the fannytix is in his confidence. Bennett may purfess to see the
                  course of subsquint events, but then he thort he seen the French mishin when old
                  Buck came in, and yet it turnd out to be mere illusin. Wun thing's consolin: the
                  man as holds the rains of guverment doosent mean to go in on the spur of the
                  moment. "Take your time, Miss Loocy," is the order of the day, and wot matter is

                  never did afore. Its Chivy Chase with him, and no mistake. Thars about two
                  thousand men in Washington continally engaged in runnin him down and worryin of
                  him. Blare, the new P. M. G., ses he bleves every slab-sided railocrat west of the
                  Allagainis, either wants to be a postmaster himself or to put a frend throo. You
                  should see the strings of fellers at the department, waitin thar turns, like
                  applycants for grub at the alms-hous offis in New York. Prayery wulves hes a
                  hungry look in snow time, but, thers a negerness in the visidges of these ankshus
                  black republikens as takes down ennything in the famisht wild beest line as ever
                  follered an outlyin trapper in hope to pick his bones.
               Old Abe is salubrus, and thars no let up to his jocular vain. The man that
                  advertises in the papers to releev persons trubbled with humors, would find him a
                  concurable case. I called on him last night at the White Hous, arter bizness
                  hours, and hevin ben in a tite place all day atween sartain Sewerdites and sartain
                  Greelyhies, he was determined to let hisself out. Enny wun can see at a glanst
                  when the old man eliqluent is chock fall of fun. On this ockashin, farseeshusness
                  was visathull in his onrestless eyes and in the quivering rinkles that played
                  about the corners of his expressiv and expansiv mouth, Shakin hisself up, and
                  flappin his elbose in the western fashin, he crode aloud as sun as I entered his
                  sanktum, and immedlently arterwtards asked me, "Why Major Anderson was like a
                  beest of burdin of the olden time?"
               Being taken unawars, I at wunst caved in.
               "Bekase, D. V.," ses, the funny old funkshinary—"Bekase he's a Sumter hoss."
               He expected the ushil larf, but I was in a kinder fog, and rekwested the lone of a
                  dickshunary. Thar was wun lyin on the tabel that he had used for the inaugurole,
                  and on openin it and findin the word "Sumpter," I rored rite out as in duty
                  bound.
               Arter a moment's brown studdy he perpoundeed the follerin:
               "Why am I like a fisherman?"
               "Mebbe," says I, "the solution is that your agoin to retake the suthern forts—with
                  a hook."
               "Dern the suthern forts," he exclaimed, rollin his eyes. "No," he continned, in
                  milder axents, "Ime like a fisherman bekase Ive got Bates in my cabbynet."
               I gin a slite catchynashin, and remarkt that he was also like a fisherman bekase
                  he was fond of a Salmon Chase.
               Deklining even to smile at my addishin to his joakt he perpounded thus:
               "Wots the difference atween me and that uther grate loomenatry, the sun?"
               "Well," ses I, "the sun's all light, and you look considabul like a shadder. Is
                  that it?"
               "Try agen," he replide, "your duller'n a stubbed broad axe."
               "Possably," I subjested, "this is the distinkshun—the hull kentry is benefitted by
                  the sun and it wont be by you."
               "Your a gopher," ses he, "and if I warnat the best naterd feller as ever made a
                  chip fly, I should be up a tree at your inyourenders. Cant you see that the
                  difference attween the sun and me is, that the sun raises in the Yeast and sets in
                  the West, and that I was raised in the West and am now a settin in the Yeast."
               Injenus, warn't it? But I dident see whar the larf cum in.
               Thinken he was rather runnin the cannondrum bizness inter the ground, I chopped
                  round and axed him wot he thort of Twiggs.
               "Twiggs," ses he, "if we could oney twig Twiggs, we'd make root and branch work of
                  Twiggs. But 'as the Twigg's bent so is the tree inklined,' and I spose this Twigg
                  being bent rong when green caused him to committ such tree-mend-us treeson."
               At this pint he stopt for breth and new idees; and thinkin it a favorabul
                  oppertoonity to git out of the woods, I made a bough, and sed with his permishin I
                  would slope. But I hed to take anuther shot, afore the grate gun of the nashin
                  would let me off.
               Ses he, as he shuck me by the hand, "Why am I like a man as hez dickered hisself
                  off to Abadun?" He sed this with deep feelin, the teers mountin to his eyes, and
                  immediently added, "Bekrase, D. V., I can't hardly say my soul's my own."
               Feelin suthin kinder risin in my throte, for I knowd how the old feller hed ben
                  badjered by the contendin factshuns, I suddently tore myself away. Old Abe's a
                  trump arter all, and I'll stand by him till his har drops off.
               
                  Yours allus,

                     mark in relation to the true meaning and intent of the inaugural, and prophesied correctly as to
                     the policy likely to be pursued by the new administration, so that the
                     self-complacent sentence with which he commences his letter may be excused. He
                     goes for non-intervention, and seems to think that "masterly inactivity" will

                  WASHINGTON, March 14, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Times:
               
               Just as I sed. Thar'll be no flatterysidall conflick. Anderson evackiates. The
                  pill is bitter, but its better than intestine war. Gallant Old Abe, arter a
                  tearabul intarnal struggle, hes starnly detarmind to leave the suthern manyax a
                  loan. Hevin no means of putten em down, he seen at wunst it would be a grand
                     coodetar to let em up, and he dun so. General Boweryguard's
                  posishin at Charlestun, espeshilly the floatin battery, bein onsaleabul in enny
                  kwater, in corse the most jewdishus plan was to cum to terms. It is sed that the
                  follerin letter was privitly cent to Lincoln, and was the immedient caws of the
                  preposed sirrender; but I gess it's ony a cunard as the French
                  say:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Mr Lincoln:
                           
                           SIR:—Altho I look upon you as a fowl useupper, and the American egul
                              sreeked in scorn when you was induckted inter the cheer of state,
                              nevertheless, in order to prevent the fushin of nuthern and suthern
                              blood, and save the cost of rebilding Fort Sumter, wich I could blo to
                              blazes with my howitstirs in fifteen minits, and also the funeral
                              expenses of Major Anderson and his murmurdums, whose fragments, ef
                              found, a proper sense of shiverally would compel us to tote to the
                              toom with the honors of war—I say, takin all these matters inter
                              considerashin, and arter consultin with my staff, I offer the subjined
                              jam up terms of capitylashin—namely: to abandun the wurks in ten days
                              from this date, and Major Anderson to be made a Major-Gineral in the
                              suthern forces, or suffer deth, witchever is most agreabul. Hopin to
                              see the skins of all the enemees of the new confederassy converted
                              inter carpets for its frends to dance on, I remane, with centiments of
                              supreme contemt, yours,
                           
                              BOWERYGUARD.
                           
                        
                        
                           P. S.—Depend upon it, Sumter's a bad egg. Better give it up afore we
                              shell it.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Coppees of the abuv is suckerlatin here, but Ime purty sartain it's a hokes. Ef
                  the President hed reseved setch a messedge he would hev made a pint of onbuzzumin
                  hisself to me. I think he's rite, howsever, in givin up Sumter. A stronghold can't
                  long be maintaned by a weak-handed garrysun on nuthin to eat. Fellers with no
                  linin to the coats of thar stummicks is apt to make a poor sho agen a forlorn hope
                  in the breeches. Arter a wile, I persoom the forts at Pencecoaler, Tarttugus, and
                  all along shore, will be guv up spontaneus—witch is much bettern'n Americans makin
                  mutton of wun anuther on thar ramparts. My idee is to giv the rebil states all the
                  rope they want. The more they hev thar full swing and the sooner they'll hang
                  tharselves. When rebellyun gits inter evry planter's britches pocket, itul be a
                  game more exhaustin than amusin, as the bar sed when he was larnin to dance Juba
                  on plates of hot iron. Fitin the cottonocrazy's all gammon. Wen they find
                  tharselves without a rap, we shall hear sumthin "a nockin at the door." Then we
                  ken say: 
                     
                        "Is that you, Sam?
                        Is that you, Jim?
                        Well, you luck purty sorry, so you may come in."
                     
                   Oney let 'em severially a loan, and that'll be the eend on't. The Richmound
                  (Virginny) Dispatch, of the elevent of March, now afore me, calls peeple as

                  (Alabammer) Advertiser menshuns a curus insident as omnebus of the sucksess of the
                  new nashin. You'll find it belo, jest as I dug it outer the paper with my bowie
                  nife: 
                     "When the time had arrived for raising our banner, Miss Tyler, with heart
                        throbbing with patriotic emotion, elevated the flag to the summit of the
                        staff, cannon thundered forth a salute, the vast assemblage rent the air
                        with shouts of welcome, and the people of the south had for the first time a
                        view of the Southern flag. Scarcely had the first report of the salute died
                        away, when a large and beautifully defined circle of blue vapor rose slowly
                        over the assemblage of Southern spirits there assembled to vow allegiance to
                        the Southern banner, rested for many seconds on a level with the flag of the
                        Confederate States, then gradually ascended until lost to the gaze of the
                        multitude. It was a most beautiful and auspicious omen."
                  
               
               Thar's two ways of readin that suspishus omin. Sum mought auger as it was a sine
                  the hull consarn would eend in smoke.
               Abe keeps a tolably stiff upper lip. I observe that the New York Express ses he
                  will hev his jokes, and pertends to giv wun of 'em. It's a sickinen affare, and
                  allow me to say entirely spewrius. The paper states that a gentleman heerd it,
                  witch is ontroo, for he never joaks, now,
                  with ennyboddy but me, and I coppyrite his cannondrums as he let's em out. Sum
                  thinks he makes 'em up, aforehand, as Sherrydan did; but I can asshure the public
                  they're all unpremuddytated and extrumpery. The followin is his last. It dropt
                  from his humerus lips not more'n an hour ago.
               Ses he, "D. V., why am I like Ginral Scott!"
               Ses I, "Abe, bekase the same measure sutes you both—say six feet fore."
               He lucked sevagarus, and snapt his teeth like a wownded wolvereen; but sun
                  rekiverin his ushil unanimity, he explaned:
               "Ime like the Leavetenant Ginral," ses he, "on this ackount, bekase Ime the hero
                  of Chip-away."
               By thunder! that was sum, now, warn't it? In coarse I hed to guv him anuther, and
                  I thort as he was a leetil riled, Ide make it complymentary.
               Ses I, "My vetran frend and pitcher, ef I may do myself the honor to call you so,
                  why are you like a sartain airthenware mannyfacterer as died in England menny
                  years ago?"
               "I cappitylate," he replide. (Poor fellow, he was thinken of Fort Sumter.)
               "Why," ses I, "semply bekase you're old Wedgewood!" and not watin to receve enny
                  thanks, I moseyed outer the presense.
               Adoo till we meet agen throo the post-offis, and bleve me verashusly.

                  [We are sorry to learn from the subjoined letter that Mr. Lincoln no longer
                     displays that mercurial and playful spirit which was wont to expend itself in
                     jokes that set the table in a roar.
                  It seems from the statements of our venerable military friend, that the head of
                     the Government is quite chopfallen, and that the

                      which were once his peculiar forte, have given place to a heavy,
                     lugubrious, despairing style of pleasantry (or rather unpleasantry), such as a
                     person might indulge in by way of trying to cheat the hours of captivity of
                     their gloom. There is a churchyard yard whistle in the jokes quoted by our

                  guverment, continnees to prevale. The presshure on the postmaster-ginral is
                  anormous. Thar's sumthin less than thirty thousand post-offisis in the United
                  States, and the number of applycants is over a hundred and fifty thousand—about
                  the sum totil of the British army to hum and abroad. Ef the guverment wanted
                  sojers, Ime dubrous wether thar'd be setch a thunderin rush of volonteers; tho I
                  persoom eenamost evry candidit for civil servus onderstands rifle practis, and
                  mite be relied on for a charge.
               The noosepaper fellers seem to be in good oder with the noo dienasty—I mean, in
                  coarse, that porslin as claims to be Abeites died in the wool. The eddytur of the
                  Currier and Inkwirer was delited with his prospecks, and guv a shampain supper to
                  his frends immediently arter bein confirmed for the Sublime Port. Ef Seward was
                  rayther hard on him wen Tom Marshall shot him in the leg, thar's a good
                  onderstandin atwixt em now and the old wound no longer rankles. I dar say Ginral
                  Webb would make a fust rate plenipenitentiary, bein now as grave as a Turk, and
                  past the age for harem-scarem adventers. He would find the Grand Senior,
                  Addle-Mushead, quite an agreable hethin when he's sober, witch isn't more'n hafe
                  the time, unless he follers the teetotal rule of Mayhumit closter than he did wen
                  I was in Constandinopul in 1854.
               I spose, by the time this letter is in prent, Major Anderson and his men will be
                  ordered outer Fort Sumter, whar, in case of a nite attack, they would hev to go it
                  blind, thar ile, camfeend, steerin candils, and lucyfurs hevin all gin out. The
                  furnishes for furnishin red-hot shot is also useless, as thar isent fewill enuff
                  in the place to lite a meersham, and they hev to do it at noon with a burnin
                  glass, and keep wun sentinel smokin all nite for the ackomydashin of the
                  offsirs.
               I notis as Twigs, the traytor, deklines a post in the suthern army on ackount of
                  his helth. His disorder issent spessyfide, but a fissishin here, who hes made a
                  dognoses of the simptoms, ses its the shakes. Sum allows as his liver's affected,
                  and uthers say he's so much debiliated that, if tuck prisner, the fateeg of hangin
                  would be too mutch for him. Benedick Arnold fit arter he betraid his trust, but Twigs, bein of a milder
                  nater, prefers reposin on his lorils.
               It greaves me to an ounce that the venabul Abe hes lost sevral pounds of flesh
                  senst he becum President. He doosent cunsidder it a fat offis, by no means.
                  Mercynary pollytishins is constantly arter him with a sharp stick, bullyraggin him
                  to that degree that Ime purty shure he wishes he was back to Springfield, with his
                  markit baskit on his arm, doin the famaly chores as ushil. His face, as lucked so
                  plesent a few weeks ago, gits longer and longer evry day, like a baloon from witch
                  the gas is gradally escapin. And it is escapin. He tries to joak as formally, but
                  he finds it heavy mowin, and his sallies is frekwently interruptid with a sithe.
                  The fact is, his cabbynet is not unanymuss. It warn't never likely that Seward and
                  Chase would hitch hosses together, and I onderstand they're as much posed to wun
                  anuther, on sartain pints, as the two Ann Tipodees. They say as Chase is for
                  applyin the argumentim ad hominy to the seeseshinists at wunst,
                  wile Seward goes for givin em time, in hops they'll see theyre error, and
                  acknollidge the corn.
               Atween the two, the venabul bed of the nashin is purty nye distracted, and ef it
                  warn't for dodging the pollytishins now and then to spend a soshil hour with a
                  sartain blunt old sojer, I think his mind would becum deceased. He still indulges
                  in cannondrums and dubble intenders, but they are chefely of a
                  meloncolic and ruefool natur. Frinstance, as we was sittin together last nite in
                  his privit sanktum—witch is labeled outside, "No admittence except in case of
                  fire," to keep out offis beggars—ses he, "Disbanded, why ort I to take lessons of
                  Mr. Rarey?"
               I'l go to Jerewsalem ef I no," ses I, cherfully, "onless you want to make a Rarey
                  sho of yourself."
               "No, old hoss," replide he, sloly, "that's not the ticket. It's bekase he mought
                  teach me how to manidge my onrooly Crew, sir."
               "Yaas," ses I, "but thars considabul difference atween tamin wun vishus critter,
                  and brakin in a hull team and sevral big dogs onder the wagon."
               "It's too true," he remarkt, and elapsed inter glummy silence.
               Wakin up arter a wile, he axed me why "he was like the Ohio River in a drouth?" I
                  sed, "Mebbe bekase he was runnin emptyins." He dident take a fence at the remark,
                  but goodnaterdly told me to stop my raillery and try agin.
               I axed him "Was it bekase he was shallow?" At witch he smiled moanfully, and sed
                  the solushin was that he was "down in the mouth."
               Then we got torking about the prospecks ahed, and I inkwired ef he thort it
                  possabul to ockupy and possess, and cetery, the forts and uther guverment real
                  estate in the fur South, as premeditated in the inaugurole? He offered no verbial
                  reply, but making a dubble spred egul of his hands, he sollemly brort em to a
                  level with his probossis, and ef I no ennything about the langwidge of sines that
                  means "over the left." Depend upon it, onless an axidental collushin takes place
                  sumwhars, thar'll be no bludshed, and I no from relieabul orthority that Mr.
                  Seward entertanes the most sangwinary expectashins of bringin things to a peaceful
                  issoo. That all difficulties may be overcum and the republic renderd wunst more
                  "wun and insuperable," is the strong hop of

                  [We have an idea that the President and the Disbanded are not on the same terms
                     of confidential intimacy as formerly. Perhaps the Cabinet officers, jealous of
                     the influence of our old friend with honest Abe, have managed to estrange them.
                     It is evident, from the concluding portion of the veteran's letter, that there
                     is, at present, but little intercourse between them. As the Disbanded leaves
                     Washington for the North in a few days, this letter will wind up his
                     correspondence for the time being. Stirring events may again bring him before
                     the public; but, in the meantime, like Hamet and Lord Byron, he gives his pen a
                     holiday.—EDS.]
               
               
                  WASHINGTON, April 4, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Times:
               
               The sege of the Wite House and the departments by the republickin mercynarys is
                  taperin down. Most of the hevvy plunder hes been sacked, and the leadin
                  freebooters hes shuck the dust from thar feet and gon off to step inter the shoos
                  of thar kicked out and resigned prettycessors. Some of the furrin envys, howsever, is onavidably detaned ontil
                  they kin ingage inturpreters and translaters, wile uthers is reddy to start at the
                  wurd, relyin semply on thar French vogabbeleries. I persoom the appintment of Mr.
                  Hirem Blarney, the oncumprommising abelishinest, to the New York collectorship,
                  will give onallied satisfackshin to Lied Garrison, Wentill Fillips, Abby Fulsome,
                  and cetery, and perdooce a "more perfeck Union" atween the anty-slavery and the
                  republickin forces. Ef I don't misremember, the noo recumbent of the collectorship
                  hed a slite skrimmidge with the magnannymous Marshil Isaiah Rineders, sum munths
                  senst, and that's all I no about his antycedents. Howsever mutch as I admire the
                  sumwot peppery, tho eggsalted, carrickter of the late marshil, I bleve, to tell
                  the scripter trooth, that Isaial was all-firedly in the wrong. Thar pears to be a
                  strong biass in favor of abelishinism in sartain offishal kwarters, and I'me
                  inclined to think the wooly hoss is the favorit hobby of more'n wun member of the
                  administrashin. I'me afeard he'll proove a wus speckylashun to Chase & Co.
                  then he did to Barnum.
               All the cabbynet is more or less in a cold swet about the Moral Tariff, being
                  confidenshally advised by relieable houses in New York, that ef the provishins is
                  carrid out, the hull city must starve. Wun letter states that an offer hes been
                  made by a famus market gardner to lease Broadway for the cultivashin of
                  sparrow-grass, and that all the Atlantic steamers is to be sold to Charleston
                  merchants; but this, I hope, is a cunard. It is not to be
                  denide, howsever, that the noo revenoo law is a terabul blo rite in the face and
                  eyes of Northern commerce, and evry nurtherner that voted for it, when the eyes
                  and nose was called in the Sennit and the House, dun a sooisidal act. It's an
                  ever-lastin pitty that Mr. Buchanan ever put his fist to it.
               An extree seshin of Congress ken aloan help the North outer the skrape, and I
                  profesy the administrashin'll hev to call wun, wotever the Triboon cleek may say
                  to the contrary. I spose, from the edytorals in that paper, as Greeley bleves the
                  Moral Tariff will coin money from the jump, and that his coajewter Daney expecks
                  it will yield a shower of gold; but ef it doos, b Jewpeter! the nuggets won't fall
                  your side of Mason & Dixon's line. The high dooties is a trump keard for the
                  South, an every Suthern importer from Norfolk to New Orleans is larfin in thar
                  sleeves to think how nicely black republickism is cuttin the throte of Northern
                  trade.
               I hevent seen mutch lately of the venabul unfortanit at the he of the Guvernment.
                  Hejoaksnomore. Thelast remark he mad to me that hed a tutch of humor inter it was,
                  that the way evrything was goin to the ____ was beyond a joak. He is reely an
                  amabul critter. Ef he knew wot to do he'd do it, but he doosent. The programmy
                  laid down in his inaugurole bothers him. He ken no more carry it out than he ken
                  split Plimouth Rock inter fence-rails with a jack-knife. The oney thing for him to
                  do is to yeeld peacefully to suckemtances, and ef the ultree black republickins
                  would stop bullyraggin him, he'd do it. Wun thing's cler enuff, matters kant long
                  remane in statue co. It's either fite or fall back, and noboddy
                  here would be suprised at enny minnit to hear of a bluddy skrimmidge. For my
                  sheer, Ime hartily sick of the pint-no-pint game as the Guvernment is playin. Ive
                  dun all I could to indooce President Abe to put his foot down Jacksin fashin, and
                  take a persishin of sum sort, rite or rong. But its no use. He seems oncapabul of
                  makin up his mind. Ive a kinder likin for the onhappy old funkshinary—but what ken
                  I do? I'll hev to leave him to the tender mercies of his cabbynet. Probably I
                  shall return to New York airly nex week, and, onless sum onexpected event takes
                  place—setch as the Government wakin up, or its enemees goin to sleep—you'll hear
                  no more at present from this latitood, from

               I wouldent reckamend my eggseggaters and legatease to bery with milentary honors
                  when I die, bekase the crack of the
                  peaces would sartainly brake my bony repose, and I should poke
                  my gray hed out of the bowils of the airth like an old woodchuck, to inkwire what
                  was up.
               The flames of war drors an old sojer jest as naterally as a candle drors a miller.
                  As sun as the flare-up in the South cummenst, I kinder felt the soltpeter stirrin
                  in my blud, and so puttin a brace of Colt's in my pockets I flew to meat the horse
                  steal fo.
               On arrivin here, I made a tender of myself to the Guvernment, representin that I
                  was no chickin in the sarvice, and almity tuff. They axed my age, and I told em
                  fifty—cuttin off ten ears—upon witch wun of the chaps in the War Department—a
                  feller as oughter ware a foolscap uniform with ink facins—farseeshusly remarkt
                  that hafe a sentry was too much for a sojer. Anuther sassy cuss sed they didn't
                  want no old files in the ranks of the new ridgyments. "But," ses I, " you want
                  vetran offsirs I reckin purty darned bad. Jest make me a kernel and I'll sho you
                  how to shell out the seesesshinists from thar ambushes toot
                     sweet as the French say." And then I told em how Ide chawed up the
                  greasers in the Mexican chopperals, and ben manured to hardships and privashins
                  among the canons of the Californy golddiggins, whar I was elected a major by the
                  miners and fit the Diggers Injens inter fits. Also I menshint the Crymean meddle I
                  reseved arter the famus battle of Blackallover, for takin a Rushin battery with a
                  rush. But it was no go.
               Pollytishins and setch hed the prefrence over old war-hosses and konsekens was
                  that these no-nuthin sheep tuck our brave fellers whar they got lammed rite onder
                  the rebils ramparts, and bucked em in ralerode trains strait inter the cannon's
                  mouth, whar they got hail Columbiad in short order.
               Arter a few lively axidents of this nater, the guverment began to diskiver as
                  civil life warn't the best possable trainin for civil war, and offerd to make your
                  frend the Disbanded a Bragadear-Ginral; but I rode the high hoss and deklined bein
                  took up for a conveenyance on the spur of the moment. When the Ginral Skunk affair
                  cum off, they was very airnest with me to take a commishin, but I replide in the
                  wurds of the man in the play that I was oney "a looker on at Vienna"—also that
                  considerin the conduck of sartain lummuxes as held commishins, I thort with the
                  poick that "the post of honor was the privit's stashin." However I volunteered to
                  reckanoiter ockashinally for the bennyfit of blind Bragadears and cetery, and when
                  the guvernment was reseving all sorts of lyin reports about the strenth of the
                  traytors in the neybrood, I scouted thar outlying posts and brort in the truth
                  from Fairfacts.
               Tho allus willin to sarve my kentry, even in a miner capassity, I don't crave
                  emplyment; for hevin shone in menny a bluddy skrimmidge wot sort of metal I am
                  made of I ken afford to lay on my ores in my old age. But as ushil I keep my
                  wether eye opin, and intend to wotch with onsleepless vigilants the current of
                  events, givin the Merkary, from time to time, the frutes of my lookubrashins.
               Thars considabal mixt up with this muss besides devoshin to "the Union now and for
                  ever one and insuperable." In coarse, the vice of the people—the fox
                     popalie, as the M. C.'s calls it—is troo and honest, but thar's an
                  everlastin' hepe of disintrusted paytriots as wants to grind thar infarnal axes on

                  cheer. You ken bleve as all these gentlemen is a shufflin thar keards with a
                  single eye to the public intreests, or not, jest as youre a mind to; but its my
                  bleef that thars a game of diamond cut dimond going on among em witch interfears
                  considably with the glorius game the peeple hes sot thar harts and staked thar two
                  hunderd millyun pile on.
               I hear to-day, as our troops is advancin lively, and that Ginral Patterson's
                  corpse hes acktilly waded the Potomac; but Ive heerd the same report so menny
                  times afore that Ime afeard its oney a cunard. Onkwestinably weve got forces enuff
                  in Merryland and Virginny to nock old Bowerygard inter a cockt hat, and Davis'
                  straits is setch that ef the current was to set agen him for a week, he'd go to
                  Davy's locker, sure. Our fellers is wulfy for a fite, and why not let em rip while
                  the steams on? Thar doosent seem to be no airthly reeson why U. S.,
                     alliass Uncle Sam, shouldent nmke short work with the C. S.,
                     alliass the Confederit Skoundrils.
               Next week, I shall, mebbee, astonish you with some privit and exclusif
                  intelliogens, and in the intrim I remane.

                  WASHINGTON, July 11, 1861.
               
               Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               Ime no ways sprised to larn as the grate boddy of the North is burnin for a
                  pitched battle. Bein detarmined to tred rebellyun onder foot they naterally want
                  no paws in the forard moovment ontil the blow is struck and the objeck carrid
                  out.
               But they oughter no wen bellyregents hes two diffrent eends in vew, wun wantin to
                  fite and the uther to fall back, the latter eend is esily brort about by the
                  retretin party. So far the Suthern Shiverally hes not shone tharselves to be enny
                  grate shakes at feets of arms, but on thar pins they are oncommon lively, ginally
                  prefferin a foot race to a funeral. They ken run agen time like kwarter losses,
                  but theyre all-fired shy of runnin agen etarnity. Sum ses thars no backbone to em,
                  but our sojers ses its wot they ginally hev to fire at in all skrimmidges with the
                  enemy. Mebbee thats why menny thinks the back of the rebellyun is broken.
               In coarse the daly papers hes made you aware that wun Kernil Tailor has been on
                  here with a sute of sum sort from Jeff Davis. He brort a flag of trooce (witch was
                  tide over his eyes on his rekwestin to see President Lincoln) and a note from
                  Jeff, witch the President deklined to anser, so the Kernils misshin prooved in all
                  respecks a blind errant. Varus rummers is goin the rounds of the Washington
                  barrums in relashin to the contens of the note, and the speshil milentary
                  curryspondents of the New York dalies is so much eggsersized in sperit as to be
                  onable to take their whisky strait as ushil. They hev axed for informashin at the
                  White House and the War Department in vane, and are fairly put to thar trumps to
                  no wots on the keards. As is ginally the case when the hull commoonity is in the
                  dark, every body purfesses to be able to thro light on the matter.
               You'll be astonisht to larn, I reckin, that while the ornary reporters and setch
                  was nonplushed about this letter of Davises, I got the sekrit volunteerily,
                  without sneekin arter it. It happent this ways. Abe and me—as the public is
                  awar—hes long ben intimit chums. We've crackt cannondrums together in Illanoy and
                  elswhars, and I sor his inaugurole afore it seen the light, and writ a programmar
                  of it, witch—as the public also nose—wetted the poplar appitite for the origin al.
                  Wall, Abe sent for me last night to cum and hev a frendly palaver with him,
                  remarkin in his commoonicashin that he had a speciment of old Mungoheeler in the
                  house as couldent be beat in Dixy's Land. Naterally I went, for I know the
                  illustrus Rail Splitter luvs me like a man and a bruther, and and tho water is the
                  oney licker as he drinks and the oney licker as I dont drink, we allus set up our
                  hosses together amazin soshabul.
               The Venabul Statesman reseved me with his ushil curtsey, and arter we hed disgust
                  the wether and uther tropics of the day, ses he suddently with a commick twinkel
                  of his eye:
               "D. V.," ses he, "hev you enny noshin wot thar was in that nmissif of Jeff
                  Davises?"
               "Cumprommis?" ses I.
               He shuck his hed in the neckatiff.
               "Sirreender," I rejined, "and evrything to be as afore, or in State you
                     go as the lawyers hes it?"
               "No sir-ree," was the reply.
               "Wanted to trade prisners mebbe,"I subjested.
               "Nary swop," ansered the venabul chefe madgistreet.
               "Alass!" ses I, kuite disannulled, "line no kungerer. If the world hed to depend
                  on me for penetratin guverment sekrits, line afeard no pollytickle mistress would
                  ever be laid bare. Wot wus thar interthe darned thing ennyhow?"
               "Well," ses he, "you needent be descuridged at not barkin up the rite tree, for
                  Eddy Puss as riddled the spynx mought hev shot as wide of the mark as you dun. But
                  Ie give you a cattygorical anser. Jeff's letter was a challenge!"
               "Wot!" I eggsclaimed, "Colts and coffee—a reglar dooill challinge!"
               "An all-thunderin wun," ses he, and then purceeded to deacon out the dockyment
                  witch I tuck down as ackeritly as I could from his 'tellagent lips, as
                  follers:

                           Havin ben onsufferably traduced by you and the hull black Republikin
                              pack, I demand pursenal satisfackslin from you as the instickgaiter of
                              the liebelleous game. My aid a scamp, Leftenant
                              Kernal Tailor will hand you this note and fix time and place and
                              cetery. Chews the kinder weepin you wish to die by. Ennything sutes me
                              from Dalgrins to Derangers.
                           
                              Yours inveteritly
                              JEFFERSON DAVIS.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "A big thing isent it?" remarkt the eggseggatiff of the Nashin.
               "A full hand at Jeff's old game," ses I, "two bullits and a bragger. Wot was your
                  respons?"
               "Nary respons," ses he, "but I bleve Ginral McDoill told the minessindger on his own responsability, that nex
                  time he cum to peek inter our defenses he should see em from an elevated
                  persishin, so as to be shure to get the hang of em."
               You may depend upon this peace of informashin bein as true and vorashus as enny
                  forrarded from the Sete of Guvermnent for menny days past, and Ime sartain its
                  eggscloosif. So mutch for enjoin the confidens of the President.
               It would be waste of stashinary to send you reports of the latest milentary
                  moovements. No too of em is alike; menny is onprobabul and sum onpossabul. Pears
                  to me that the Father of Lize hes bruck his chane, and is endamnifyin hisself for
                  bein tide up for a thousand yeers, accordin to Scripter, by indulgin in extree
                  radickalers capers. In course you'll git all the latest contradickshins by
                  tellygraft, so I shant interfear with the wirepullers in thar mendashus bizness. I
                  will oney obsarve that the artifishil lightnin is as likely to blind peepul as the
                  genwine artikel.
               
                  Enter noose, as the French ses—witch means "we shall see." Enny
                  wun as studdies the maps kennot fail to be sensabul of Davises straits. He is in a
                  bad fix ondoutedly. Sum folks thinks thars not a loop hole left for him; but I
                  think thar is—jest wun—and it's my bleefe that he'll run his long neck inter it.
                  That he may do so purty recently, is the airnest wish of

                  WASHINGTON, July 18, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               As Ginral Scott's plans drors to a foecuss, the nayshin will appreeshiate the old
                  War Egul's milentary talons, tho he differs in his pinions from sartin
                  fether-brained kwill-drivers of the press. Owin to his foresite Victry perches on
                  our banners everywar.
               In Western Virginny rebellyun has univarselly throne down its arms and tuck to its
                  legs. The stamppede of Roar-and-Run was appropritly finisht at Saint George, whar
                  the Georgyans was put to the route, boss foot and dragons, as the sayin is. The
                  shiverally wanted to vamose on the sly, but our boys cot em in the Cheat, bruck
                  thar right wing and mluttoned em ginrally ontil they ran inter the brush to eskape
                  a further lamming. The retreat of the enemy was not kivered, and thar rare
                  presented a curus specktickle in konsekens of throwin off an onmenshinable porshin
                  of thar wardrubs to fassillytate thar flite.
               Providense seems to hev faverd all the moovments of Ginral Maclellin, and his
                  conduck commands our airnest prays. Rosencranch also prooved hisself a sterling
                  sojer at Riches Mountin, and Morris crowned hisself with reethes of glory at
                  Lauril Hill. As menny sposes the latter to be Ginral George Pea Morris, the poplar
                  author of a Long Time Ago, it is oney rite to state that the hero of Lauril Hill
                  and the poick of the droopin willow is two distink persons and attatched to very
                  different collumes
               The forrard march of the main army so long demanded in the name of the publick by
                  high privit Greeley, kommenst yesterday, but on makin inkwiry of Ginral Macdooill,
                  I larnt to use the eggsact words of that distingwished leader, that the moovement
                  was "due to the wisdom of Ginral Scott and not to the brutum
                     foolmen of the Tryboon." Sixty thousand men hes
                  put out for Richmond. Old Blackguard Bowerygard sed our war cry was buty and
                  booty, and I rayther gess he'll be butifully booted by our gallant sojers, who air
                  all anxshus to toe the mark as sun as possabul.
               I hev it from a vorashus source that when alls reddy for attacting Richmound, Old
                  Chepultepeck will take the command and put the rebils throo in person. His idee is
                  to catch em in a net and give em a seckind edition of the Hauls of the
                  Montyzoomers.
               Prisoners, from kernils to korporils, is in profushin. It is the entenshin of the
                  Guverment to rekwest em to take the oath of legions, and ef theyre willin to
                  sware, to bid em go and sin no more; but if tuck in arms a seckind time they are
                  to be tuckt up immediently.
               Sum further noose about Jeff Davises pirits is no doubt ankshusly shusly looked for by your shipmasters, but if enny
                  hes arove at hed quarters it has oney reached the privit ear of the Secketary of
                  the Navy. Ef that venabul old fogey hedent a ben rayther behind the light house,
                  the rebil craft wouldent now be at sea, making siezeyours. He seems to me to blong
                  to that class of keerful fokes as locks the stable dore arter the mustang's
                  stolen. Ef the blockhead of the Missysippy hed been closte, the Sumter could never
                  hev got outer its mouth. 
               Thars nuthin speshil as regards the condishin of the army here. The kwartermasters
                  and sutlers continnees to swindle the poor sojers as ushil, in their vitals and
                  close. To look at sum of the New York ridgements you'd spose that messrs Tagrag
                  & Bobtail led gone inter the army clothing bizness. As the man in the play ses
                  "No eye has seen sitch scarecrows." I calkilate thars over two thousand privits at
                  the seat of guverment without no seats to their pantyloons. The dinners of the
                  volunteers ginally is very ornary, and ef wun third of the army purvayors was hung
                  they would git no more'n than thar desserts. It eenamost makes my blud bile to see
                  a passil of marcynary loafers and land shirks takin toll out of our gallant
                  fellers daly bred. Peeple say, but I hop without good ground, that thars an
                  onderstandin atween the kurnils and kwartermasters of sartin ridgyments, and that
                  they go shears in fleecing the rank and file. I see by the New York papers that
                  the State Committee on uniforms hes been puttin sum of the milentary tailors throo
                  thar facins. But wot do they keer, the ragmuffins! "Committes on uniforms be
                  darned!" sed a clothing contractor to me the uther day—"let em rip!" The misabul
                  locusses!—all they think about is cabbidge.
               The Honabul Abe, I rejoice to say is in fust rate condishin, and cums out
                  stronger'n ever in Callembores, as the French minister calls
                  his cannondrums.
               Last evenin as we sot smokin our meershams together konfidenshally on the rear
                  terris at the White House, ses the illustrus man to me, pintin to the
                  Potomick:
               " D. V., my friend," ses he, "why is your bed like the Long Bridge?"
               "Eggspound," I replide, for I couldent imadjin wot the venabul Nestor was a drivin
                  at.
               "Wall," said he, "its bekase its a wooden structur."
               "Mebbee," ses I, when the larf had sobsided, "you ken tell me why your nose
                  resembles that remarkabul joak o' your'n"
               Rubbin his oilfactory organ as he ushilly doos when he runs agin a reglar poser,
                  he remained for a few minnits berried in thort, and then gin it up.
               I explaned that his nose resembled his joak, bekase it had a long
                     bridge inter it.
               He sed he couldent see it, and I tuck him to the big mirror in the East Room, when
                  he immediently acknoledged the corn.
               Then he axed me what motive Ginral Skunk had for buckin agen the Vienna battrees;
                  but I seen the trap at wunst, and replide a loco-motive.
               We torked considabul about the prospecks of the camppain, and both of us agreed
                  that it must eend in the rebils bein completely discomforted and disbursed. We
                  also freely disgust the merits of the opposin ginrals, and I eggsprest my regret
                  that a bragadearship warn't offered to Cushin, as he'd a ben the very wun to set
                  onto Pillow. The President remarkt in his dry way that he thort from what he'd
                  heern tell of thar eggsplites, in the Mexican War, it would hey ben raythur a soft
                  match. I then inkwired how it was Ginral Wool warnt ordered to the field, and
                  larnt, as a sekrit not publickly known, that setch is Ginral Scott's frayternal
                  affeckshun for that distingwished offisir that he cant abear to send him whar
                  thars enny danger. The luv these bruthers in arms hes for wun anuther is sed to be
                  ekwil to Demon and Pithyass.
               It is not onprobabul that afore this reeches you Patterson will hev hed a turn up
                  with the traitor Johnston. Patterson at the last accounts was threttenin to give
                  it to the rebils right and left. God defend the right, is the prare

                  WASHINGTON, July 25, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               I sartainly bleve as the Deestrick of Columby ken raze a bigger crop of lies than
                  ary nuther ary of the same size outside of Tofit. They grow in Washington
                  spontanus, like musheroons, and when transplanted by tellagraft inter the New
                  Yorkr papers, they take the shine out of Satin. Yaas, ef Lucyfur had a ben
                  operatin with the brimstun battrees of the bottomless pit and Sinbad the Sailer
                  hed furnisht the reports, the two together couldent hev held a kandle to the flyin
                  tails of our defeat, sent by lightnin from this city to yourn last Munday.
               The caws of our discomfortsure is as varusly reported as the legind of the three
                  black crows. Sum throes the blame on the wimmen and Members of Kongress and setch,
                  as went out to see the slorter as ef it had been a theayter tradegy plaid for the
                  amewsment of the buty and fashin of Washington. Wun things sartain, they had no
                  more bizuess thar than a poodle dog hes at a painter hunt. As mought hev ben
                  andizzypated they lost; thar heds when the balls begun to wiz around, and the way
                  they put out was a cawshin to fast crabs. I don't blame 'em for that, bekase as
                  the him ses, "It was thar nater too," but what rite hed they in the mauss at all?
                  Sum ses that when the paytint lethers and pettyecuts krommenst to run and holler,
                  the Ohio ridgeyments—who hedent no confidence in thar leeder, Ginral Skunrk, to
                  begin with—simperthised with the unfortnit critters and started on the dubble
                  kwick to overtake and pertect em, and so the stamppede bruck out. Uthers traces it
                  to the teamsters who on bein sot upon by the enemees hoss, turned tail and left
                  thar waggings —ondressin tharselves as they fled and runnin like deers for bare
                  life. Wall, these is very purty yarns, but you kant ketch an old war egul who was
                  on the war path in Mexico and led two stormin parties at Sublastapool with enny
                  setch chaff. Our forces was misabully manooverd. Oney twenty thousand outer
                  forty-five thousand was brort inter the fite, ammernishin fell short and the
                  sojers hed no grub for more'n twenty-four hours. They were eggspecktod to give the
                  fo a bellyfull on empty stummicks. And by the everlastin! they fit like tigers.
                  Rusell who was in the Crymeah when we tuck the Mammylone and the Mollycoff, ses
                  the New York troops was as steddy onzder fire as the crack ridgements ements in
                  the English and French forlorn hops. They never gin in ontill nater gin out. 
               The fact is that every corpse under fire behaved like trumps. Napollyuns troops
                  dun, no better at Sulphurino. But our men was outnumberd and faintin for want of
                  vitals, besides the odds agen em bein all of three to wun. War was Patterson?—darn
                  his pint-no-pint tracktricks. I want to no ef he aint the Billy Patterson weve all
                  heed tell on, as went dodgin about axin who struck him and was allmlity ankshus,
                  not to find the man. It acktilly pears that the blind old cuss tellagrafted for
                  reinforcements to meet Johnstun, arter Johnstun hed formed a junkshin at Manasses
                  with old Boweryguard. What a misabul donkey. And yet hees onably discharged!
                  Pollyticks!—pollyticks!—that's wot manafactors basswood bragoadears. Doos
                  ennyboddy spose ef Wool had been in the old Pennsylvauy Foo Foo's place, he would
                  a ben lookin for an enemee at Harper's Ferry as was forty milds off, buckin inter
                  our troops at Bullis Run? Nary time!
               The savidge conduck of sum of the Suthern shiverally doorin the fite would hev
                  disgraced Rushin Cassocks. They cut prisners throats and sot the wownded up for
                  targets, and perpetrated thar bleedin boddies throo and throo with bullits in the
                  aggernees of deth! Ef that's thar game thar dark deeds must be rekwited by lettin
                  daylite inter em in the same fashin. Setch feinds desarve hafe a yard of steel
                  apeace and nuthin shorter when they cry for kwarters.
               The honable Abe was kinder tuck aback when the fust squod of mendashus fudgetives
                  cum bustin in. Subsequintly he rekivered his presents of mind and sent his valley
                  to Capitol Hill to luck for me. I never was node to desert a comraid in a bad box,
                  so I made tracks immediently for the White House.
               "D. V.," ses Mr. Lincoln, puttin his arm throo mine as sun as I cum in, "this noos
                  rayther decomposes me; wots to be dun? Accordin to the tung of rummuer we are
                  lickt."
               "My Presidnshil frend," ses I, "we may be lickt but we air not chawed up. I
                  suspeck considabul of this story is figdishus."
               "I predicate your rite," he remarkt, "but a steamer sails to morrer and the morril
                  effect in Yourip will be wus'n the tariff."
               "Darn Yourip," I replide, "we'll giv the rebils setch a hammerin yet that no
                  nashin on airth will reckognize em. Afore a months over we'll put em throo thar
                  facins in setch a shape that England'll be ashamed to countenance em."
               
               "D. V.," ses he "youre a hull team and a bull terrier atween the wheels, in the
                  way of razin a feller's sprits," ses he; "you never orter a ben disbanded. Wot
                  shell I do—spit it out."
               "Wall," I responded after codjertatin a minnit, "jest send for Maclelliu and put
                  me onto his staff."
               The Venabul Cheef Madjestrit nodded his hed twyst, and winkt wunst, so I persoom
                  he entertaned my projeck.
               Troops is continually arriving. The armny hevin rekivered from its fateeg feels
                  like a bird and is a raven to hop wunst more onto the fo. We shant be crowed over
                  long, you ken swar to that. It is sposed here that Ginral Lee has left Lynchbug in
                  sairtch of Maclellin's forces, a Lynchbugger rebel hevin tellagrafted wun of his
                  frends to that effeck. I trust he'll find him, for he doos Ime konfident he's
                  lost.
               Dont be downcast in the North, for depend upon it the upshot will be the
                  prostrashin of the traitors. In a fair shoulder and elbo wrestle we ken giv em
                  lofty fall and no mistake. Trustin sun tu see the Stars and Stripes wayin over the
                  ragamuffins rag I remane, wolfier'n ever,

                  WASHINGTON, August 9, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               I larn from a verytable sorce as bred stuffs is amazing skarse with the
                  cornfedrits at Manasses, and as beef is meated out to the men in allmity small
                  chunks. Konsekens is sum of the flour of the Suthern Army is gettin wurmy, and
                  onless they air better supplide with the grate staples of life thar'd be
                  considabul bolting afore long.
               Our spies report much sickness in the rebil camp. More'n a thousand of
                  Boweryguard's shiverally is down with the shakes; and the billiards—as they call
                  the billyus fever in Virginny—hes also prosterated menny as skaped the flyin
                  balls. Ime sorry to say thars ben a power of fever and ager payshints in our own
                  hospittles senst the commensment of the Dog Days, but bark and canine brakes up
                  the decease in most cases. The blazin temperatoor at this season is all-fired
                  tryin to Nuthern constetooshins, and severall of our cumpanies as cum here as
                  fresh complected as yung redishes is now as yaller as carats. The roasting heat
                  brings all the bile to the surfiz.
               But the orfullest cuss in these diggins is the musketers. The sojers faces wen
                  they cum in from pickit dooty, lucks as ef they'd ben sowed with fire and the crop
                  was cummin up oncommon thick. Milyuns of the sangwingary critters rise outer the
                  slashes at sundown and charge bagnet on evry onfortnit human as chanst throes in
                  thar way. Doughskin pants wont turn thar pisind weepins, and when they attact the
                  bare skin they make a bluddy buzzyness of it and no mistake. A medicle firend of
                  mine ses he never seen such phleabottomy, but its wusser'n fleas a darned
                  site.
               No sines of a forrard movement at present. Menny thinks thar'll be no March ontil
                  September. In the mean time the seckatary of war is reddin the army of sartain
                  puzzelanymous pups, and puttin stanch West pointers in thar places. Maclellins
                  dizzyplin is likwise dooin us a good turn, and our troops will be reddy to renoo
                  the game whenever Simon ses wig-wag.
               Desarters from the rebil camp reports as the noose from the north bout our sharp
                  shuters makin thirty inch strings, has hed a neckstensive effect at hed-kwarters.
                  Plumpin a ball throo the oxiput at evry pop is cuminin a little to near the bull's
                  eye to shoot the idees of the bullies of Bull's Run. When Jeff Davis was informt
                  as his effygee was shot forty-four times in suckseshin throo the dieaframe, at
                  Weehawking, they say he was tuck sick at the stummick and turnt as pail as ef he'd
                  ben a goin to kick the buckit.
               I onderstand as Boweryguard, Jonstun and Lee hes sent sekrit orders to a
                  Philadelphy manfacterer for four bullit-pruff shirts witch is to be smuggled South
                  by female secesshinists onder thar onder-linnen, the upper edges bein konsealed
                  with lace so as to peer like the tops of their shimmysets. I trust as a brite luck out will be kep for em, for I don't
                  want our sharp shuters to waist thar powder and shot on steel corsets. Howsever
                  thars no call for em to fire at the boddy; they kin aim at the eyes as Old Put's
                  men sighted the British grannydears at Bunker Hill.
               Talking of female secesshinists, thar infarnal tretchery is a eawshin to Deliely.
                  They air continally goin South with Nuthern arms onderneath thar pettycoats, and
                  criminal curryspondence in thar buzzums. We oughter hev a femmynine perlece on
                  Mason and Dickson's line, to sairtch thar wardrubs and kompel em to make a clean
                  brest of it. As it is they air little better than locomotive mastkt battrees.
               Prence Napollyun hes, ben the lion of the weak. He likes honest Old Abe amazinly,
                  and ses no wunder the peeple lucks up to him, for he reelizes his noshins of a
                  poplar president. They hev hed a present time together and our venabul Chefe
                  Madgistrit hes astonisht his distinguished gest with a few of his button-busting
                  cannondrums. At the White House Bankwit on Saturday his raillery is sed to hev
                  made the company larf till they nearly split tharselves. On wun ockasshin he axed
                  the Prence why French Love was like the rage for French Fashins.
               "Genessee Par," replide the Prence—drorin his hed down atwixt
                  his sholders like a skared terrapin.
               "Wal," ses President Abe, "its bekase its a Gal-o-mania."
               I don't see it, do you? But they all rored Ime told, so I spose it was a
                  remarkabul. wittyschism.
               In coarse Napollyun hed to spit out sumthin in the way of a rejineder, so ses,
                  he:
               "My dear sare, vy shall you resamble Shackaspear's Reachard?"
               The segashus statesman of Illanoay for wunst confest a nonplush.
               "Attenday!" ses his hyness. "You resamble Shackaspear's
                  Reachard, becos you hop to conkare rebellius Reachmond—aha!"
               But noboddy sed Ha! Ha! in reply.
               All suckemstances, considered its difficult to say whether the Prence's illushin
                  to Richmound was intended as a complement or a back handed slap at the late
                  forrard movement.
               Ginral Scott, who sot opposit the Prence onderstood it in the latter senst, and by
                  way of givin himt wun in return, got off the follerin:
               "Why was your illustrus sire like Jefferson Davis?"
               His hynless srugged his sholders and gin it up.
               "Ile tell you," ses the Ginral, "why your illustrus sire was like Jefferson Davis.
                  He seceeded from the American union."
               The Prence fanned hisself with the dinner keard and made a horrabul grim ace, for
                  he couldent help but see as the old vetran allooded to the Patterson marridge.
                  Howsever, he sun rekivered, and evrything past off pleasantly.
               I wouldent be kwalifide that the foregoin ackrount is correck to a dot; but I hed
                  it from a person as goes evrywars and heers evrything and tells evryboddy. Mebbe
                  you no him. His name's Jenkins, and he's considered reliable by all the members of
                  the Assoshiated Press.
               I hev menny more skraps of informashin on hand as I should be glad to send you,but
                  as the mail is jest ready to start, and post and rail waits for no man, I must
                  postpone them till nex week, remaining as ushil,

               The kee-holes of the guverment offices bein stopt up, the deef and dum allfibit
                  interdooced as a mejum of konfidenshil konversashin in the Cabbynet, and all
                  evesdroppers kept outer the administrashin burrows, the rebels is deprived of the
                  airly informashin about our milentary moovments formally supplide to them throo
                  the speshil curryspondents of the New York Daylies. As they depended on the
                  Washington letter rites for reglar and full ackounts of Ginral Scotts pans, the
                  meshurs takin for cuttin off those gentlemens interestin tales is konsidered a
                  sore afflixshin at the rebil hed kwarters.
               Senst the issoo of the crewil orders witch has curtaled the liberties of your
                  paytryotic jurnils, more'n two hundred seeseshinists here hes stopt taken of em.
                  Setch is the consekenses of milentary
                  desputism! Giv my compliments to the eddyturs and publishers as hes ben compeld by
                  suckemstances over witch they hed no control to keep back informuashin they
                  couldent git, and tell em they hev my airnlest simperthees.
               You air aware, in coarse, as I would be the last critter on airth to giv aid and
                  cumfurt to the horse steal fo; but as Ime informt as all the leadin seeceshers
                  tends camp meetins and is convinst of sin, I persoom they doosent read Sunday
                  papers, and tharfore will be nun the wiser for any sekrit informashin
                  commoonicated to the North throo your collumes. I bleve I vilate no confidense, in
                  estimatin our vailable force in this city and subbubs at 499,000 men, and I ken
                  state as positive fack that as sun as this detachment hes ben increast by the
                  formashin of new ridgements to 994,000, a forrard moovment will immediently take
                  place in all direckshins. So far as the plan of operashins hes ben made none to
                  me, it is calkilated to insoor brilyant and desisive victries at every pint of the
                  cumpass, arter witch the hull army will shake hands with the President and
                  instantly retire to privit life, each sojer receivin as mutch land as he hes the
                  face to ax for and a thousand dollars to sport hisself and fammaly on, until the
                  fust crop of hog and hummony begins to cum in. Ef it meets the vews of Congress
                  the wind is to be raised for the sojers, by sails of confisticated Suthern Cotton
                  and ransumming the the Suthern Shiverally at $5000 a peace, or less ef thar frends
                  doosent considder em wuth takin outer pawn at that price. Contrebands is also to
                  be returnt to thar nateral gardeens at the same figger if reckwired.
               The blockhed continnees onsatisfactory—leastwaysy to our side, but I hevent larnt
                  that the South makes enny culmplaint agen it. The Richmond Whig hes
                  considabul to say on this hed. Speaken of the harbors of South Caroliny it ses
                  thar mouths is open and private ears is runnin in and out with impewnity. Not a
                  Union crewsir is heerd on in Allbemaul Sound, or seen from Cape Lookout or dredded
                  at Cape Fear. Howsever if thars, enny truth in Welles the Navy Department is dooin
                  its hull dooty and haint by no means the mlisabul old pump as menny sposes.
               Thars ben a sevagarous muss it peers in the seceshers Cabbynet. Seckatary Toombs
                  told Presedent Jeff he wanted Washington infested and tuck rite away, and the
                  spiles divided, to witch the grate Mussysippian replide by makin a spred egul of
                  his fingers and perching it on the eend of its nose, at the samne time spittin
                  sarkasstically. Toombs immediently threw up the portfool, of his department, and
                  left the presents grumblin, Jeff raisin the toon of "Hark from the Toombs a
                  dolefull sound, Mynheers attend the cry", in honor of his absence. Senst then the
                  distingwished Georgyan hes gon and lested for the war as a South Caroliny
                  bragadear. I onderstand as Boweryguard and Johnstun, hevin an idee that thars
                  considabul of a puss in the guvernment coughers is all-wulfish ankshus to sack the
                  federal Capital. Let em cum on. In the langwidge of the sellybrated Ginral Riley
                  of Missoouri: 
                     
                        "Come one, come all, this rock shall fly
                        From its firm base in a pig's eye."
                     
                  
               
               Take Washington!—why it would be an easier task in caparison for a Floridy wrecker
                  to onlock the gates of Heven with the Dubble Hedded Shot Kees. But all the rebel
                  leeders thinks about is plunder. To use wunst more the wurds of the forsed Genral
                  Riley theyre "a lot of spavined, ring-boned, ham-strung, wind-galled, swine-eyed,
                  poll-eviled, split-hoofed pollytishuns," as hed thar noses in the public crib
                  ontil thar warnt fodder enuff left to make grewill for a sick grasshopper, and ef
                  they could oney git thar ugly snoots inter it agen, now its replenisht, they'd be
                  as mutch in thar element as a drove of shad-bellied shoats in a rooter-bugger
                  patch. But they kant cum it. They've got all they ever will get. The nashinal egul
                  sits pearched aloft outer thar reech on the tree of liberty, and they ken neether
                  skare him with thar shootin iruns nor kretch him by puttin seeceshin salt on his
                  independent tail.
               The fall of Ginral Lyon, in Missouri, is deeply mourned here but we hev the
                  satisfackshin of noin that the rebel Jackalls was druv howling from the field
                  where they eggspected to fast on the spiles.
               I hed a short intervew with our venabul and farseeshus President on Munday last,
                  on witch ockrashin he axed me why this Fall would resembul airly Spring. I
                  reckwested hafe an hour for considerashun, and he gin it to me, but I couldent git
                  it throo my har—so he was kind enuff to solve the mestry. Ses he:
               "This Fall will resembul airly Spring bekase thar'll be a forrard March in
                  September."
               Ime afeard he forgot, in his overflown humor, that he was revealin an important
                  Cabbynet sekrit.
               Hevin nuthin further to add I sum up by remainin as ushil,
               
                  Yours allus,

                  WASHINGTON, August 23, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Thars an all-thunderin site of old wimmin in the world disguysed in maskline
                  habillyments, and I reckin this intrestin tribe of critters aint thicker around
                  nowhars on the face of the airth, than they air here. Consarn the varments! theyre
                  as grate on awefool proffersighs as the Witch of Ender, and they raise Sam with
                  skary goneys as is soft enuff to be suckt in.
               Jest now these crokin cusses is torken tharselves inter a cast-iron swet on two
                  tropics. Wun is that Bowerygard and Johnstun is a goin to make a tearin attact on
                  the Seat of Guverment and tuther that England and France intends to break up our
                  Naval blockhed. Nuther story hes enny solid foundashin. The rebel ginrals hes
                  rayther less idee of pitchin inter us than I hev of buckin blindfold inter a nest
                  of rattlesnaix, and its eesy to see from the claws about America in the Queen's
                  speech, as the Brittish Lion doosent mean to thrust hispaw inter our nayshinal
                  kwarrel. As to France, I larn from the Seckatary of State that the Emprors frendly
                  perfeshins reseved throo Prence Napollyon two weeks ago last Saturday is
                  konsidered bony friday.
               I don't think in my own pinion tharll be enny hullsail fitin in this region ontil
                  we opin the purseedings, and that'll be when Scott & Maclellin is reddy to
                  sail in, and not afore. In the meantime it would be a mussy ef the grannies in
                  boots and britches as runs around spinnin sensashin street yarns, was put onder a
                  rest and sot to mendin sojers stockens, darn em!
               What do you think of that times-sarving supersquirtical cocknee cuss, W. H.
                  Russill? They hit it to a frackshin wen they tact L. L. D. to his name. Lies Like
                  Darnashin, it stands for I calkilate; but the cocknee pronounsiashin, Hell Hell,
                  D. soots him jest as well. The puzzelanymous critter!—I sor him, when he cum in
                  from Centerveal arter the battel of Bull run, pantin like a pup hound arter a bar
                  hunt. His har stud on eend, his eyes peered as big as sawsirs, and the greese was
                  a dripping offer him like the fat outer a barbacued shoat. He made the best time
                  ever heerd on from Fairfacts, and heddent even breth enuf to lie for ten minnits
                  arter he arriv here. I was standin in Willard's bar rum when he rusht in, and of
                  all Gods humans that ever a skare tuck the starch outer, he was the limpyist and
                  the dunoverest. He shuck like a teeter snipe with the third day ager, and ef it
                  hadn't a ben for the five fingers of brandy the bar-keeper pored out for him, I
                  think he'd a hed a connipshin fit on the spot. The hoss he druv is senst ded.
               And this is the flunky as writes to the London liebilmungers as owns him, that
                  thar warnt a battry carrid, nor a bagnet crost, nor a
                  hand-to-hand-knock-down-and-drag-out skrimmage, nor a desput struggle, except to
                  git away, in the hull runcounter. He seen nuthin of the kind, he ses.
                  How in the name of partickler thunder could he, onless his eyes had ben behint,
                  for accordin to all ackounts he no sunner smelt gunpowder than he wheeled his rare
                  to the fire like a shiverin cur on a frosty morning. And the misabul sarpint shode
                  his liebilous letters to the seeceshenist leeders afore he sent em to his cocknee
                  masters, it seems. He's a sneakin spy, that's wot he is, the pot-bellied skunk.
                  Ginral Scott hes provoked the pass he gin him I onderstand, but that aint enuff he
                  oughter be consined back to his English owners in a soot of tar and fethers.
               The Christian Sosiashin Sabbath Committy as cum on here to warn the guverment agin
                  the onpardanabul sin of flaxin out the rebels on a Sunday, left, Ime informed,
                  with a flee in thar ear. The Army Chaplins guv em the cold sholder, and the
                  offsirs advised em to go hum to thar mars and tend Sunday skool and not interfear
                  with milentary camp meetins. They axed the President ef he hed no venerashin for
                  the canons of the church, but he oney winked his wether eye, in his ushil good
                  humerd way, and told em his fust dooty was to silence the cannons of the common
                  enemee. Finerly they shuck the dust off thar feet, and made tracts for hum,
                  thinkin, I spose, that retches as would wurk for the salvashin of the kentry on
                  the Lord's day was little better'n the Hittites and other foes of Jehovah as got
                  Jessee in Skripter times. Now, my noshin is that walkin inter traitors to God and
                  man, tooth and toe-nail, on a Sunday, is eenamost as acceptabel to Heven as dozin
                  in a fashanabul church—but then I aint no orthority for super-sanktified fokes,
                  most on em considerin me (vewed in a relidjus lite) as a bad egg, and in fack but
                  little better'n an infiddle.
               
               We larn to-day as the seeceshers is strenthenin thar persishin at Acqui Crick, and
                  sum ses "Why doosent Old Welles give em acquifortis?" Simple civilians kant see
                  the polysee of allowin the darn'd theves to plant thar rifeld artillery all along
                  shore. They say ef the seckatary knew beans he'd shell 'em out. But I tell the
                  grumblers he's oney waitin tell the hull river's fortyfide from Mount Vernon to
                  the Chaseapeak, so's to make a single job on't and fix all thar flints to wunst.
                  Cummin as he doos from the lyal State of Conneticut he Innst be sum punkins, I
                  gess, tho at present evry thing in his department seems to be throne inter pi.
               At lenth the bizness of snakin traitors outer the guverment burrows hes commenst
                  in airnest. It was about time, fur they was as thick and sawsy as the Coyotes on a
                  Western dog prayery. Sartainly the way skoundrils in offis hes been hunny-fugglin
                  and betrayin us ever senst the Fort Sumter turn-up, beats Judas. I conseat thar
                  never was a guverment on the fut-stool kwite so owdashisly sold. Oney think of our
                  extre perleece as gits twelve dollars a week apeace to gard the city agen traitors
                  in war time, bein two thirds of em Jeff Davis's rebel cattle, while the mare
                  hisself wares the seecesh collar and drors in the same team.
               Troops is porin in like an avalaunch and the army is as full of spunk as a herd of
                  mustang colts in fly time. Ef Bowerygard and his Murmurduns thinks we owe em, let
                  em dror on us at site and we'll lickwmidatte in full.
               All the heds of departments is as lively at catfish in a freshet, and Maclellin
                  works like a beaver. They are all kwite frendly wen we meet, and Seward ses he
                  larfs hartily over my letters, tho wot he sees to larf at Ime darned ef I no, for
                  ef ever thar was a curryspondent in sober airnest its

                  WASHINGTON, August 30, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               We larn from the buck of Genesees that man was oridginally snaked inter rebellyun
                  by a member of the femmynine sect. He dident, hisself, pursenally as an
                  individual, hanker arter it—in fact it was Adam's Express wish to keep outer it,
                  but Eve overperswaded him to go in and he dun so, and evry thing went to blazes as
                  mought, hev ben andissipated. In konsekens of this onjestifiabal act of hern, all
                  kinder wickedness hes ben called Eve-ill ever senst.
               Aperiently sum of the darters of that fast woman of antickity inherits thar
                  Marmar's taste for plotting treson with Abadun. Not to speke in pairabuls,
                  pettycut puffidy is makin no eend of trubblel here. On Tuesday last a Suthern lady
                  of the hyest tun crost our lines with two hunderd wait of percushing caps for the
                  Nobs at Richmondt. On Wensday the wife of wun of the big guns of seeseshin was
                  rested with twenty revolvers consealed in her mantiller. She wals spotted in
                  konsekens of droppin a Colt as she was steppin inter her carridge in frunt of
                  Brown's Hottel. Purceedin to her rum they sairtched the baggidge and found in a
                  trunk six duzzen Aireansaw toothpicks, a plan of the Slashes and other artickles
                  contrabrand of War. But wus than all three yung ladlies froua Louseanna was cort
                  yesterday in the act of conveyin aid and cumfurt to the enemee in thar
                  onrder-linnin.
               The way of it was this. Suspishin hevin ben directed to em by a synonymus letter
                  thar dry goods was seezed and on sartain onmenshinabul garments of theirn diegrams
                  was diskivered of all our strong points in inwisabul ink, witch on bein held to
                  the fire cum out in blue and red, showin in glaring cullers the treesonabul nater
                  of thar desines. Wun of the sketches kivered the hull sirfiz of a pair of
                  ondeskribabuls. Washington Navy Yard ockypied the legs, with a carricatoor of
                  Seckatry Welles in the back ground, chasin, hafe a skore of clipper bilt craft, in
                  a Tiber Crick mud skow. Onderneeth the skow was rit in Rummun karicters the
                  wurds—"LET HER RIP—VAN WINKRLE". The captins of the clippers was represented
                  standin on thar starns with thar fingers and thums purjected out from thar noses,
                  as ef takin an observashin of the Seckatry with thar Naval sextons. This shamless
                  liebill on the active and lively Giddyun, was found at the bottom of the youngest
                  lady's ridicule. Anuther droring on wun of the misses stays, was a fac semele of
                  Fort Corkrun, with Seckatry Camerun desguysed as a Chatham-street Few, sellin
                  sekind-handed pantyloons to sojers. Below was this inskripshin. BEWAR OF MOUNTIN
                  IMPRACTICABLE BREECHES; and in smaller letters "Behold the rale Simon Pure." This
                  sketch was dragged outer a dirty close bag. I ort to say these intrestin pettycut developments is doo
                  excluesively to the New York perleece on dooty here, for the Deestricks offsirs is
                  a shiftless set of fellers and hes no more idee of the tricks and subterfudges of
                  female traitors than a ded drum fish hes of the musick of the spears.
               The wardrubs put to setch vile porpusses hes ben confisticated, and will be placed
                  amung the curosities fit the paytent offis as monymaents of the lenths to witch
                  the misgided South carries its bellygerent projecks, and displays its hatred for
                  sum of the mitey sperits at the hed of affares.
               A kind of pennytenshiary for traitors of the crinoleen perswashin hes been fitted
                  up here, and sevral as would hev sold us to the enemee hev ben placed in solentary
                  sells. The objeck of givin em separit berths doorin thar confinement is to prevent
                  em from layin thar heds together and hatching more treeson.
               Ef it warnt that I've promest the illustrus old gentleman at the White House to
                  keep dark I could send you sum thrillin noose about the eggspeedishin as sailed
                  tother day from Fort Munroe. It would make your harts leap ef you new wots a
                  bruin, but honor ses paws, forbear—and I must lissen to her vice. I may menshin,
                  howsever, that altho the race is not allus to the fleet, the operashins of the
                  squodrun will not be slow. Butler is ankshus to dror the enemies claret, and ef
                  Stringham cums acrost enny private ears, they're everlastin sure to be cut off. In
                  the meantime, luck out for a heavy slap at the Suthern cost. Prehaps afore this
                  reeches New York, you'll hear of startlin firewurks in an onprepared kwarter.
               I suppose youve red Russills last liebill and the commontories of the London
                  Times. Isent John Bull a consistent pup? Arter yellin hisself black in the face
                  agen niggerr slavery, he cums out flatfooted in favor of the slave-dirivers. He
                  has no simperthy for wool when he kant git cotton. His soul's in his pus, and ef
                  Sea Hand cotton was growd in Tofit, and its brimstun shores was blockheaded by
                  cherrybums, he'd go in for brusbin throo and makin a commershil treety with the
                  enemee of God and man on the terms of the most faverd nashins.
               Cam and undismaid the upright Abe maintains his elevated and loft persishin both
                  furrin interfearance and dummestick treason. His reddy wit and satyr, onequilled
                  senst the ainshent poick Juvenile, convulses all as cums in contract with him.
                  Mrs. Lincoln who has been kept in a rore of lafter for uppards of twenty 'ears by
                  his errisistabul cannondrums, hes, as you air alware, gon North to recrute, and is
                  at present mewsin herself self in the neybrood of the great Catarack. The fack
                  that she ken injoy the glories of natur and the gay and festiv seen at Long Branch
                  and Niagary doorin the present orful crysis, is a pruff that her eelastic mind
                  sores abuv nayshinal mesfortin and is full of lively hops in a seesin of ginral
                  gloom.
               In the same cheerful frame of mind I remain,

                  WASHINGTON, September 6, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Wunst more the Merican Egul fixes his sorin eyes on the Sun, and wings his
                  suckling flight throo the bloo volt of Hevin, sreekin Hellalooyou like an
                  eggsighted locomotive. The seecession bray over Manasses hes ben compleatly choked
                  down senst we nocked em cold at Fort Hotterass. Dispatches from thar today states
                  as the peeple around is delited with the change and considers our ockypashin of
                  the Sound pro bono pamlico. I see the Richmond
                     Whig calls it a barrun victury, but I gess the seven hundred
                  triators as is now tastin its bitter frutes doosent think so. Ginral Bulter ses he
                  never seen fellers so down in the mouth. The offsirs keep a purty stiff upper lip;
                  but the privits, who sposed that Commadore Stringem would hang em, or make em walk
                  the plank as sun's they got a board, hed teers in thar eyes wen they gin up thar
                  weepins. In coarse Ginral Butler feels as proud as a speckled hoss on county court
                  day. He warn't slo, was he, in expressin hisself to Washington, with the noose of
                  the explite? He hes that wether eye of his'n on The Presidenshil Cheer and no
                  mistake, but the crowd pressin in that direckshin is so numerus and spry, that Ime
                  afeard his hops will be blasted. In fack he hes about as much chanst to go in and
                  win as wun of Ben Wood's Lottery Tickits hes to turn up a Capital prize, or the
                  North pole hes to be shivred with chain litenin.
               The rummer of Jeff Davis's deth created a lively sensashin here, and much disapintment was felt on larnin that
                  it was oney the pirit craft of that name as hed gon under. Pity it hedent a ben
                  the man of mark instead of the letter of mark as went; to Davy's locker. However
                  they say he lies a fatil decease in wun of his optickle nerves, which is sartain
                  to carry him off kwick's a wink wun of these days. But mebbe the story's oney got
                  up for a blind. Ef he doos go down to an ontimely grave Toombs will probly be his
                  suesessor, onless seeceshin caves in afore eleckshin day.
               Puffessor Low made an ariel vige from our lines tuther day, and remaned in the
                  atmostfear about forty minnits. He brort interestin intelligents from the skies
                  consarnin sum new rebel forts below Alexandry; but in my opinyun his forts is
                  nuthin more'n castils in the air. Wile makin his observashins, the rebel
                  artillerists at Munson's Hill gin him a complimentary ball, and he immediently cum
                  down, as the coon did to Captin Scott, to save further trubble. I suppose you
                  remember the pufessor. He puffessed his intenshin of makin a beeline throo the
                  clouds from New York to Leverpull, two years back, but it eended in belyin publick
                  eggspecktashin. Arter razin the wind he deklined to go up on ackount of the Fall
                  bein onplesant. Who'd hev thort setch a bag of wind would ever take a high
                  persishin at the seat of guverment; but war's like a skwall at sea, it brings enny
                  qwantity of bubbles to the sirfiz.
               The female rebels in prisin here allows thar sufferins is past endurance. No
                  balls, no consorts, no keards, no theayter, no shoppin, no street yarns, no
                  compliments, no flirtashins, no chanst to pore thar sorrers inter the ears of
                  simperthisin traitors. A house was sot on fire in thar neybrood tuther night,
                  hopping they would be abel to raise cain with thar gards, and run away by the
                  light of it. But it was no go; the offsir was on the key veeve,
                  and the bolt dident cum off accordin to the program. It is sed that Bowerygard hes
                  ofert to ransumn the fare jail birds at the rate of ten prisners of war a peace,
                  and to thro in the Honabul Mr. Eely and other nun-cumbertents as makewaits, but
                  the guverment prefers the wimmen and declines to dicker, witch renders thar
                  predickermenelt ridickerlous. I feel mitey little pitty for em, howsever. Even wen
                  it wares pettycuts I kant say Alass for Treeson! And yet; these female kulprits
                  hes sum caws of complaint, arter all, fur at the very tine they was tuck prisners
                  a sartatin rank femnmynine rebel here was in the habbit of torkin seecesshin to
                  the guvermrent funkshinaries tharselves without enny attemp been made to captivate
                  her. I seen this elegant and fashinabul traiteress with my own eyes figgerin at
                  the party of wun of the Seckatries last week, and makin herself as much to hum as
                  Bellesbub did wen he played the spy in parrydice. The marrid wimmen among the
                  captives greves purty hard about bein seprated from thar spowses, Ime told, but
                  wives as act the part of Arnolds deserve no better'n to be deprived of thar
                  Benedicts. In fack thar trecherus capers is wus'n the miss demeanors of the young
                  lady seecesheners, bekrase they no more, and hev more wait in the community, and
                  dident oughter to be so easily carrid away.
               The enemeee enkampt on the opposite side of the river is as lively nights as Texas
                  fleas in a greaser's blanket, and jest as anxshus to dror blud in the dark. They
                  hop by pickin off our pickets from thar ambushes, and setch kinder sneaking
                  gorilla warfare, to git our army to make a brush at em wen they ken take the
                  advantedge. But they kant cum the spider-and-fly game twyste in wun camppain, I
                  calkilate. Wen Maclellin's reddy he'll pitch inter em like a fish-hawk into a
                  sktool of mossbunkers; but in the interim they mought as well try to git a fox
                  outer his hole by torking turkey to him. Thars a rod in pickle for em tho, and no
                  mistake; and when the time cums for usin it, salt wont save em. Ef it warnt that
                  paytryitism forbids, I could tell you all the particklers; but in order to make
                  the blow shoor, it is important to keep the fo from gitting wind of it. All I ken
                  say is, you'll hear sumthin drap atwixt this and October, and it wont be the
                  Star-Spangeld Banner.
               I continny to enjoy the confidence of the eggsalted hed of the nashin, and am
                  happy to say that my letters in the Merkary—witch is his favorit amung all the
                  weaklies—meets his vews to a dot. He sissers em outer the paper regarly and files
                  em away with as much keer as ef they was offishal dockyments. As we was ridin out
                  together to the Chain Bridge tuther day to make a reckannoysence of the rebel's
                  wurks, he gin me a hull string of cannondrums—sum of witch I prepose to send you
                  in my nex epistol. You may consider this a speshil favor, for Vanity Fare and
                  Harpers' Weakly hes repeatedly applide to him for contribushins in vain.
               With airnest assperashins for the sucksess of the good caws, I remane, as on
                  prevyous ockashins,

                        Washington. He loves a "skrimmage" better than any Irishman that ever
                        trailed a coat through Donnybrook Fair, and the smell of gunpowder is as
                        grateful to his nostrils as eau de cologne

                        ears," and it is easy to see from the tenor of some parts of his letter that
                        he is spoiling for a fight. If there should be a battle at the capital, he
                        will be in the thick of it, sure as fate.—EDS.]
                  
                  
                     WASHINGTON, September 13,1861.
                     Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
                  
                  Three week senst, wen all the foo-foo letter-riters allowd as Washington was in
                     immedient dannger of a salt, I pernounst it gammon. Peeple as bleves in the
                     predickshins of the speshil curryspondents here, must be at a loss for profits.
                     Thar bizness is to manfactor sensashins, and they make up thar artickles outer
                     hull cloth—breeches of truth not bein considerd of the slitest konsekens by
                     these false tail-barers. Wal, the sete of guvermnent hes not ben attracted jest
                     as I sed it wouldent. The storm hes not cum, but quiet rains. No wun can say
                     wots in the wind, but thars no simtums of hard blows at present. In the
                     meantime everyboddy is on the key veeve for slorter evry
                     mornin, and goes to bed, cussin thar blasted eggspecktashins at night. Ef it
                     warnt for pickit shootin and keards, the city would spile for want of
                     reckcreashin. But the milentary offsirs plays youcur and brag, wile the privit
                     sojers makes up little parties amung tharselves, to go picket huntin by
                     moonlite, and as the rebels plunges inter the latter amewsment with all the
                     ardor of thar Southern naters, sumtimes as menny as five and six centries is
                     wiped out in a single night. Both sides keeps tally of thar game, and up to the
                     present time the insirgents is five privits, three corporeals, and two sirgents
                     ahead.
                  The gamblin housen here is to be shet up, to prevent em from spilin the morril
                     principals of the army paymasters. Wun of these innercent but ventursum
                     critters hes ben onfortunit enuff to be bled to the toon of a hundred thousand
                     dollars, gurverment munny, at cut throat, witch Uncle Sam will rekiver about
                     the time that Faro's treshurs is fisht from the bottom of the Red Sea. The
                     misabul man axes a suspenshin of publick opinion, but I think publick opinion,
                     espeshally in the army, is rayther in favor of a suspenshin of him.
                  Considerin the expense, it is thort by sum hasty sperrits that the war is
                     etarnal slo, but I onderstand that arter the Nayshinal Fast, Ginral Scott
                     intends to walk inter the sassy rebels allmity rapid. In the meantime the
                     guverment is dispersin over a million a day without givin enny aperient check
                     to the moovments of the enemee. Wun thing is sartain, namely, if we dont sail
                     in purty recently, Boweryguard and Johnstun will raze a muss in Merryland. I
                     hev it froms a relieable gentleman—not the ungodly retch as tells setch
                     sickrenin sockdologers in the daylies, but a honabul highminded spy as I keep
                     for my own privit use—that the mane body of thar hoss, and the bone and sinner
                     of thar foot is on the upper Potomnac, and as sun's they ken git boats the hull
                     raft will be over. My spy, who has the onlimited confidence of all the rebel
                     leaders, ses that wile they are makin faints in frunt of our lines they
                     eggspeck to give us fits in the rare. Ente noose (as they
                     say in Payris), ef they try that they'll find we hev em on a strings and nary
                     loophole to creep out at.
                  The dirty little squab owl of the London Times hes gin another
                     hoot at us, I notis. He's a feerce bird on a small skale, but his talents isent
                     sharp enuff to hurt ennyboddy, and senst he shode the white fether in turnin
                     tail at Centerveal, and Ray let daylight inter his liebils, noboddy keers a
                     hooter for his skreeching. Ine told he attribits the orderin of twenty-two
                     thousand fresh troops to Canady entirelie to his letters, and intermates that
                     ef he isent treated with the respeck doo to an eggsofishyo repersentative of
                     John Bull, the Lion and the Eunuchorn will pitch inter the Merican Egul
                     quicker'n a greased thunderbolt. I hope no vilence will be offrd to the little
                     cuss. He aint wuth tar and fethers.
                  The remark that puttin trust in prences is like leanin on a brokin reed doosent
                     seem to hold good as regards the Empror of all the Rushes. His majesty hesent
                     disremembered Unkle Sam's kind feelins tords Old Nick his imperial parient,
                     doorin the Crymean War, and he offers a wurd of cherful, encurridgement when
                     all the rest of the crown heds is larfin in thar sleeves at our differculties,
                     and hopping airnestly sun to see us on our last legs. All honor, I say, to the
                     distingwisht Musstgofight! Success to the Musscoveys—and Ime raal sorry, now,
                     as I fit agen the Zar's father at Inkaman and uther places on the Black Sea. I
                     was a darned fool to take up arms agen him for John Bull, and I take this
                     oppertoonity to make the a a mend onabull. Its troo as neether
                     Alegsunder nor Prence Gartersoft, puts the boot on the right leg in thar
                     letter, but it shoes the Zar hes a nobul sole, and desires to be on a friendly
                     footing with Yankee Doodle. Seward torked to some purpuss wen he called it
                     magnannymous.
                  Thar was a Cabbynet meetin on Toosday, and I am informt from a sekrit sorce,
                     namely the dorekeeper, that a varity of meshers for bringin the war to a
                     foecuss was disgusted.
                  The Seckatry of State thort that in the onrepressabull conflick with the South
                     the Lord was on our side, and he looked to the grate Helper and the good Book
                     for sport in all our tryalls.
                  The Seckatry of War sod that for his part he agreed with Tolerant, the
                     sourcaustic French minister, that Hevin was on the side of them as had the most
                     cannon. It was on that ackount that Ginral Wool hed added Le Grand Cannon of
                     Runslayer county to his staff.
                  Ginral Scott—who was present by invitashin—srugged his sholders when the name
                     of Ginral Wool's new a decamp was menshint, and remarkt that bdin a feller of
                     small caliber he could oney be counted as a son of a gun.
                  The illustrus wood chopper of Illanoy was mutch tickled by the joke, and
                     slappin the Hero of Chipaway on the back larfed until the teers cum inter his
                     eyes.
                  Secktary Welles allowed that altho an old man, he felt the fire of seventy-six
                     stirrin in his vanes, and reckamended the addishing of a few more seventy-fours
                     to the navy.
                  Secktary Smith sed that the people in the Inteerior dident crave enny more
                     seventy-fours in that kwarter, but considered that Twenty-eights and
                     Thirty-twos would be much more sarvisable to the kentry. Lively craft was wot
                     was wanted for the present naval blockhed.
                  The hed of the Treshury Departmrent was absent, bein engaged at the patent

                     litenin.
                  The conclushun cum too by the Cabbynet Counsel was that the war should be
                     persecuted both by the army and navy with the utmost rigger, arter which
                     Camerun sung the "Sojer's Tear," and Welles "The Open Sea," while the President

                  fail to gratify him. Greeley, I persoom, will coppy the pome inter the Tryboon. It

                  lies promist his shiverally to pitch inter us hot and hevvy afore the weaks out.
                  Darnstown is a villidge in Munggummery County, Merryland, about twenty-five milds
                  up the Potomac, whar they sell the meenest whiskey on God's airth and drink too
                  big horns of it to tell a strait story, so I dont place mutch reliance in enny
                  darned yarns from that kwarter, and as to Boweryguard he's too cunning a coon to
                  giv publick notis of a fite two or three days aforehand. I reckin him and Jonstun
                  is oney faintin, and doosent intend to make a serous a salt on our lines at
                  present. Howsever, ef they want to buck thar heds inter a bumblebees nest, let em
                  cum on. Evrything is fixt here to giv em a stinger as'll make em hop. I was'at

                  WASHINGTON, October 4, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               So arter faintin in frunt of Washington for weeks Boweryguard has fallen back!
                  Noboddy onderstands wot this noo feter in his tracktricks means, but it looks on
                  the face of it as ef all idee of attacktin the Capital had ben gin up. My privit
                  spy is now in the rebel lines, howsever, and as he nose the ropes, I expeck to
                  receve ackrit informashin about this fresh moovement of the retched traitor in a
                  day or two.
               As the tellagraft fourstalls all noose by pen, I leve the latest intelligense to
                  the litenin; but I ken take you behint the seens and let you inter the confidense
                  of the rooler we all look too to keep things strait. Yesterday the Chefe
                  Madgistrit cent for me to the White House, and I hed a conversashin with him of
                  hafe an hour, of witch I made minits for the SUNDAY MERKARY. I give
                  the dialog percisely as I logged it dowm.
               "D. V., my good frend," ses he, straitenen hisself up arter stoopen to shake hands
                  with me, "wot is your opinyun of the asspeck of affairs?"
               "That," I remarkt, "is rayther a ginral questin." "Yes," ses he, "it's a ginral
                  questin, but you onderstand the kernil of it; I want your vews on the war as it
                  stands."
               "Wal then, to speke onlest," I replide, "I think it stands too long.
                  The peeple want it pusht along to a conclushin. We air spendin sum two millyuns a
                  day, or tharabouts, and my centiments is, thars thunderin little to sho for it."
                  "My frend," says the venabul chefe, pullin a gray hare out of wun of his little
                  bushes of whisker, "the 'games afoot,' as the poick ses, but the time to 'cry
                  havoc and let loose the dogs of war' hesent cum yet. We must wait."
               "Very good," I responded, "but why warnt the Fort Hotterass victory follered up?
                  We was told as two more eggspedishings was to start immediently to shell sum uther
                  pints on the Suthern cost. Whar air they? Thars allus vessels of war a layin off
                  at Fortress Munro and other places whar they aint no more use then they would be
                  high and dry on Gorgetown Hights, why air they not cent sumwhars else to pufform a
                  second edishin of the bumbardment of Fort Hotterass?"
               "Welles isent reddy," ses he, "besides thats not the programmy. A grand blo is to
                  be struck simontaneously by sea and land. By the way, wot do you think of
                  Welles?"
               "Raythec a delicut kwestin, Mr. Lincoln," I anserd, "but, howsever, the Disbanded
                  isent afeard to meet it. His auntycedents as far as morrils is konsarned is
                  tip-top. He never cuzzined noboddy, allus paid his dets, sed his prairs nights and
                  mornins, and tuck his meals reglar. But as to his talons for a crysis as threttens
                  to rend the nashin in twane, I konsider 'em nix".
               "You're mistaken," ses my venabul frend. "Welles is a man of amense intelleck. I
                  hed my doubts about it at fust, but Ime satisfide now that oney give him time, and
                  he'll astonish the kentry. Then thars Camerun, wot do you think of Simnon?"
               "Wall," ses I, "I wunst seen a play in witch thar was two carrickters they called
                  Simon Pures, and wun was a decent man, and tuther seldom wanted for ennything that
                  warnt out of his reach. Witch of the critters the
                  Democratic-Consarvative-Republican Seckatary of War most resembles, I leve you to
                  diskiver. I know, howsever, that his frends in Pensylvany is willin to bet on his
                  goin out of offis with a millyun of dollars in his pockit. But he's got sum
                  energy, ennyways, and ef he oney fights the good fight like a trump, who keers for
                  trifels?"
               "D. V.," eggsclamed the Venabul Abe, kwite sharply, "you're remarks is
                  liebellious, In the hole world thars no trooer men than my offishal advisers—troo
                  as steel, sir, and as sharp."
               "If thats the case," ses I, for I sor he was gettin riled, and I dident want to
                  anger the old man, "they're in thar rite place in the Cabbynet. Setch men in these
                  dejennerate days is cabbynet curosities."
               Here thar was a paws in the conversashin, and I got up to shake hands and leve.
                  The onest and faithful patryit gin me a backwoods grip, with teers in his eyes,
                  and ses he:
               "Disbanded, my hart's bound up in this Union, and if wun kullapses tuther will
                  too. Accordin to the lite I hev, I wurk onsleepingly to pervent setch a breaking
                  up. Ef I kant keep the masheen runnin as I found it, I hop to be berried onder the
                  reck with the old flag in my hand, singin out E pluvious unum
                  to the last."
               "My nobul frend," I replide, "the masheen's in no danger. The Union, I trust, will
                  never be in setch a pickle that it kant be preserved. As to this rebellyuu, itul
                  be put down as sartain as the airly
                  sunshine 'll cum in at the East Room winder to-morrer mornin. Ef wun Cabbynet
                  fales we must try anuther; if wun army gits tuckert out we must raze anuther.
                     BUT THE THING MUST BE DONE. Outer thirty millyuns of peeple,
                  twenty-five to-day is in favor of the Union—and its got to be ophold and
                  perpetuated jest as shure as the livin sun hes got to roll onnard in his corse
                  givin the world life and light."
               And with this, skweedgin the illustrus rail-splitter's hand wunst agen, I took
                  leve. And now, beggin pardin for being onushilly serus and matterafact in this
                  epistol, I take my leve of you, ontil we meet agen nex week throo the post offis,

                  WASHINGTON, October 11, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               My confidenshil spy, a reglar Metamory of a feller, perfeckly vorashus and never
                  known to eat his own words, returnt last night from a long reckonnonsense. He was
                  kwite onsuspected and obtained no eend of noose. He peers to hev maid mennyrandoms
                  of every essensual pint as cum within the pail of his observashin. He ses the
                  condishin of the enemees clothin is redickalus; it takes the rag off the bush of
                  ennything he ever seen in the way of peacemeal wardrubs. The suppleturn offsirs
                  was in strips and onwillin to wheel round on parade for fear of exposin the rips
                  in thar uniforms. As to the common sojers, sum of em hed muttonied and refused to
                  train being ashamed to face the mewsick on ackount of thar newditty. Setch
                  ridgymendals never, he ses, was seen on humans; the skarecrows spring styles in a
                  Connecticut cornfield bein full dress in caparison. At Darnstown he sor sum of the
                  troops at wurk with needles and thred sowin wun anuther tares, but it warnt a
                  grain of use, they bust out immediently. Thar foot gear was ekwilly delopidated.
                  Hevin a taste for staytistrickrs he counted nineteen thousand big toes peeping
                  like terrorpis heds throo the shells of milentary boots and shoos at the Gap, and
                  about the same number at the Junkshin. In fact, the hull rebel army on the Potomac
                  is on a mity bad footin, and all efforts to remedy the evil air likely to proove
                  bootless. The oney critters among em as makes a decent sho is the field
                  offsirs—all the rest, includin even thar crack riflemen, bein as ragged as city
                  poppers.
               I larn also from the same sorce that the rebel army is gettin all-thunderin wurmy
                  about thar grub. The hog an homany hes purty mutch gin out; in Ann Arundel and
                  Mungummery, and weevly bisket and red-eye is a kinder bevridges as isent
                  calkillated to harden the sinners for the tug of war. Boweryguard and Johnstun
                  will sun hev to relingkwish thar foothold in that krwarter, but when thar necks
                  movement will cum off is not yet detarmined. Ef they dont take the back trail
                  south afore the first of November, an appeal will be made to thar feelins with
                  balls and bagnets, that will be puffectly onresistabul.
               Thars nuthin new in the way of gossip in these diggins. The "relicabul gentmen" as
                  mannyfactors orthentic unpossibilitees for the press, peers to hev took a recess
                  to rest thar imadjinashuns. Human mendassity hes its limicks, and fibbing will
                  pairalies the fancy in the eend, ef stuck too aciduously for an ondefinit lenth of
                  time. The bar-rum circkles, howsever, is in full blast, and continally
                  proffersighing tearabul events over thar smashes. The catastrofy never cums, but
                  still they pussyveer in thar predickshins. Ses wun of three blatherskates the
                  uther day at Willards:
               "My frends," ses he, "I hev shure entelligents as Bowerygard, Johnstun and Lee is
                  a goin to attact us. Washington stands on a volcano!"
               "Duz it, me boy?" ses an offsir of the Meager ridgement, porin out a glass of
                  whiskey, "well, ef the Capital stands on a volcano, here goes for a swig at the
                  crater!"
               I larnt from the President, yestday, that plans for no less than three sekrit,
                  eggspedishings is now on the tappee in the war and navy
                  departments, and I shouldent be astonished ef we heerd of orful dooins coastwise
                  atween this and All Fools day. The hed of the nashin is of opinyon that the
                  seeseshers, will be nockt cold afore the summer, and evrything, to use his own
                  frays, restored to the statue co anti bedlam, witch meens I
                     spose as the Suthern loonyticks as hes
                  divorced tharselves fromu the Union will be brort to thar marrybones and wunst
                  more beg for an asylum onder the old flag.
               The votes of the Pennsylvany troops for the State eleckshin was took on Wensday,
                  but in the absents of pollytishens and rum thar warn no paytryotic enthuzzyusm.
                  The sojers went to the poles with freezin indifferents, the bands playin Hail
                  Columby as they marched to the ballad bxes, and the hull affair passed off as
                  harmonius as the mewsick of the spears. The cattridge box is just now konsidered
                  the pallajum of our libties, and until the sword is sheethed, noboddy is likely to
                  keer mutch about the rite of sufferedge.
               The revew of light hoss and hevvy artellery on the broad plato of Capitol Hill,
                  day before yestday, was a grande specktickle. My tall and venabul frend, the
                  President, druv me to the ground with Mrs. Lincoln and yung Seward, in his new
                  bayrush, and as he stud in his carridge he was in coarse the sinecure of all eyes.
                  The manovering was elzwill to ennything I ever seen the Crymeah. Nine battrees was
                  posted on each wing of the battalion of dragons, and as the skripter ses "the
                  thunder of the captins and the shouting" was puffeckly stunnin. Ginral Maclellin
                  was delited, and Mrs. Lincoln aloud the site of so menny shinin blades made her
                  feel like Joe Ann of Ark or the Maid of Sarah Gosser, witch I was arterwards
                  enformt was the votrees of Bellowner as flurished several sentries back. Finaly
                  the entire force formed in collume and saluted the President, arter witch the
                  artellery and cavalry was divided inter two divishins and each hafe was dismissed
                  seperitly to its kwarters. Ef the men behave as well on the battle plane as they
                  did in the old fields back of the Capitol on Wensday, the shiverally will be
                  sartain to sho em the backs of thar shakos at the first charge.
               The case of Freemount sell hangs by the ilids. Sum ses hees bound to be
                  cashsheared for misusin the publick money confisticating niggers and uther
                  mistymeaners; but I reckin ef hees fortnit enuff to flax out Price evrything will
                  be overlucked.
               Thars stll two or three female traitors here confined in thar own housen onder the
                  sirvillians of the peleese; but thars mor'n a duzzen of em at libty, and its my
                  beleef as evry skeem of the guverment is known at Richmound afore it leeks out in
                  New York. At present, howsever, the cabbynet hevent enny importent projeck afoot
                  for walkin inter the rebils. As sun as they hev you will as ushil git a hint on
                  the subjeck, from

                     either fight or fly forthwith. General McClellan's aDvance means mischief. He
                     is now in effect offering battle to the rebels, and if they don't takle the
                     initiative within ten days, he will. We are on the eve of a great combat, and

                  WASHINGTON, October 18, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The way the shiverally is pitchin inter wun another beats cock-fitin Floyd and
                  Wise hes ben for sum time past about as frendly as Killkenny cats, and each hes
                  endevored to make his own tail good in the rebel noosepapers, witch hes given both
                  parties rats for not cummin to the scratch with Ginral Rosecranch. Wise hes ben
                  took sick in konsekens of overheatin hisself on the retreat, and while he is lying
                  on his back at Richmound, sum of the jernils of that city intermates that he is
                  oncapabul of speekin the truth. The oney chanst for him to eskape court-marshaling
                  in this wurld is to leave suddently for whar he belongs in the next. As to Floyd,
                  the gun-grabber and Mussassippy stock stealer, his offsirs hes sined a roundly
                  robbing charging him with all sorter mistymeaners, and sent it to the Richmound
                     Inkwirer The benine eddytur of that seven be nine sheet
                  publishes the charge, and insinawaits as the distingwished arsenall theef ken hev
                  the names of his accusers, ef he'll promis to fite em in routashin, wun arter
                  anuther, witch bein in feeble helth and rather narvus, he respeckfully declines.
                  He allows his life is pledged to his kentry, and I persoom the pledge will be
                  forfitted whenever his kentry ken ketch him. Eenamost all the Suthern jernils
                  blames the cummanders on the Potomac for not goin in, and in fack thar seems to be
                  a kinder plug muss atmung all the engineers of the secesh masheen.
               Them extree vishus traitors, the sequesttraitors, is doing a big bizness in the
                  burgler and land pirit line. Honabul August Bellmount I spose is in a juce of a
                  way about his terbacker. In coarse he'll never get a quid
                     pro quo for the first chaw of it. Poor August! they put him throo the
                  latter eend of September, and considabul of the sequestered weed hes alreddy ben
                     foddered out to the rebel troops and
                  convarted inter old sojers. Howsever, five hundred hogs heads belonged to
                  Wrathschild, an eminent findandshear of the Hebrew gender. Won't he blastfeam and
                  tare his garments and sit in sackcloth and ashes, when he heers how the rebels hev
                  walked inter his nigger-head and pig-tail!
               But thats not the wust. Theyve even confisticated the hum of Jefferson, and I
                  predicate ef they could git Mount Vernon they'd put it inter a lottery and raffle
                  off the bones of Washington at so mutch a chanst. I wunder doos these God-forsaken
                  critters eggspect to go to Pairodice when they step out. Ef they do its my opinyun
                  they'll find tharselves all-fired mistaken. Thars a place all reddy fenst off for
                  em by the Prince of Darkness in the midst of his enfarnal regents, and I persoom
                  they'll be briled on the same gidiron with Benny Dick Arnold and Judases Carrot.
                  The way they'll be hauld over the coals 'll be a caushin to Sally Manders.
               I called at the White House last evenin and hed a plesent palavir and sum supper
                  with the tall and talented tenant of that traydishanall tenement. I never seen him
                  more waggish and joclar, and youre awar that wen he's in the vain, he ken git off
                  wot the French calls Jew de Mose ekwil to enny live Christian.
                  Fust we torked over the Chickenmacomico affare, and we both crowed over it
                  considabul. He remark that the insargents thort they hed it all thar own way at
                  the outset, but when the Mountshellar made her onset, and began to lay em with ten
                  inch shells they conclewdid the eggspidishing was a bad egg. Arter praising the
                  galliant commander of the craft up to the nines, he asked wot I thort the Navy was
                  most in need of jest now.
               "More gunboats, Abram," ses I.
               "No my vetren frend," ses he, "more BRAINES."
               I think that was about as handsom a dublin tender as ever was got off. I oney wish
                  the grave and solem Giddyun could hev heerd it. As compliments when ellegently
                  paid, is not despised by men of lofty stashen, I told the illustrus railer that it
                  was "fust chop—in fack, a reglar splitter."
               Then we canvassed the intents of the Nuthemr Peace party, and agen I seen humor in
                  his eye. Purty sun he let drive.
               "Disbanded," ses he, "why is makin beds like hysting Peace flags?"
               I codgertated for a minnit, and then told him I sposed it was bekase both was
                  ginally done by hirelings.
               "No, my lad o' whacks," he replide, "its bekase its a white fether movement."
               I sniggered, and seein I hed caught his meanin he also indulged in slight
                  catchinashin.
               Presently we commenst speakin about Freemount and Missoori, wen his visedge agen
                  suddently lighted up and he perpounded the follering:
               "Wots the cheapest way to put down the rebels in Missoori?"
               "Freemount's plan" ses I—"sequester all thar darkeys."
               "No," he replide "that's agen the Constitooshin, witch is the funnymental lor of
                  the land. The cheapest way to redooce the rebels in Missoori is to cut down thar
                  Price immediently."
               I considered the joak rayther far fetched, but chuckled over it to obleege the
                  puppytraitor.
               Our necks theme was affares at the sete of guvernent. Mr. Lincoln asshured me as a
                  grate battle was very eminent. He ses the rebels must either fite or foot it
                  within a week. Mebbe the darned theves will steal off arter all though. But the
                  President thinks not. He bleves theyll curm up to the scratch, and that
                  Maclellan'll nail em. Upon the hull, thats my opinyun too. A ginral action may
                  commence at enny hour, and when it doos begin itul be setch a game at cut throte
                  as never was played in this hemaspear. I shall be thar when the collusion cums—you
                  ken gamble on that.
               Awaitin impayshently the signal to sail in, I remane eggsightedly

                     WASHINGTON, October 24, 1861.
                     Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
                  
                  The long aggerny of the Summer and Fall campaign drors fast to a buddy ishoo.
                     Maclellin hes made up his mind to mount the rebels in airnest, and the grand
                     climbacts is closte at hand. The army is in the hyest spirts, and on file to
                     meet the Suthern incinderaries. The
                     volunteers sware they wont go inter winter kwarters ontil Bull Run is
                     tearabully avenged. Our advance thretins rebil lines at Centreveal, and fearful
                     butcherwork will sun take place, onless the insurgent force shambles off
                     towards Richmound.
                  Its purty clar by the bulletins from Leesburg as all the milentary fools isent
                     dead yet by a long shot. The objeck was gained, its troo, but it was a much
                     more slorterous affaree than it oughter ben. The idee of throwin oney seventeen
                     hunderd men acrost the river to attact ten thousand, all ambushed in the woods
                     with thar rifels cockt and thar fingers on the triggers! It was the act of
                     moonymaniacs. An then to think of the offsirs takin partickler pains to march
                     thar men rite inter the middle of a six acher lot, sirounded on three sides
                     with hevvy timber swarmin with possum-playin seceshers, and a mild of rushin
                     water in the rare. Why a blind rat wouldnt hev ben cort in sech a trap. Our
                     brave fellers performt progenies of valor, but bein cumpleaty hemmed in, they
                     got, in coarse, an allmity belting I spose its no use cryin over spilt milk,
                     but warnt the arrangements maid to afford em sucker a caushin to loonyticks? A
                     flowtiller consistent of two leeky mud skows and a crasy canawl boat, with
                     fifty men apeace, was sent to the resky, but they cumneer sinkin, and its a
                     mericle that the hull on em warnt plugged afore assistants reached em. At lenth
                     arter a nobul stand up fite of an hour or more our galliant boys hed to back
                     down. They broke for the river, and bein pursood by an overwelming force,
                     intosticated with victry, menny was druv inter the drink. Doorin the skrimmedge
                     more'n two hunderd of our men was hit, and a still larger number was missed
                     when the rolls was called at brekfest-time necks mornin. However the loss was
                     not all on the Union side; the Mussysippians cort it hot and hevvy, and numbers
                     of the South Carolinians fell to rice no more. Finerly Banks with five thousand
                     men and plenty of cannon crost the Rubygun the pint was gained. To-day it is
                     said as him anld Kernril Stun is offerin battle to Ginral Gustatrvus Smith,
                     formally Ginral Scavenger of New York. I hop ef he venters on brush he'll run
                     agin that tremenjus sweepin masheen called the besom of destruckshin. Its not
                     onprobabul as the brooming may cum off afore this letter reaches its
                     dustynashin.
                  Its onpossabul matters ken remain as they air. Large kwantities of provisions
                     for our army is now in the mouth of the Potomac, and it must be opened and the
                     food brort up. That river is the alimentary canawl of the capital, and it wont
                     anser to heV it stopped. Oney two transports hes worried throo this week, and
                     they hed thanr gaffs shot away at Cockpit pint, but the captins bein game birds
                     shode a clean pair of heels, and cum crowin up to Washington. They left thirty
                     vessels below Mathiasses, frighted with supplies, hosses, arms, and cetery, and
                     afeared to attemp the passidge. Sum fokes sposes as the rebel canons is not
                     ekwil to ours, but I no the tears of guns on thar Potomac wurks is the best
                     modern weepins, and Ime informt as the Pig Pint Battery bristles with
                     rifle-boars "like quills upon fretful porkyoupine," as Hamlet ses in the
                     play.
               
               
                  
                     FRIDAY, October 26, 1861.
                  
                  This mornin I hev to take back part of the foregoin. The fack is that lyin
                     reports cums in so everlastin thick, that ef a faller commits any noose to
                     paper he's allus in dannger of committin himself. A curryspondent as gesses at
                     wot's goin on up the river, is more lieable to tell the truth than ef he
                     depended on the current informashin from that kwarter. Slipshod letter riters
                     as puts down wotever cums to hand, ushilly diskivers afore the ink is dry that
                     they've put thar foot in it. To-day we larn that Banks and Stun, who was sed to
                     be hungry for a fite with the grate Gustarvus, ahd eggspickted to make a clean
                     sweep of that black traitor and his murmurdums, hes fled back to Merryland with
                     a flee in thar ear. So six or seven hunderd of our best sogers bes ben killed,
                     wounded, drownded and took prisners in a reckonnonsense witch reflecks nuthen
                     but disgrace on the heds as planned it.
                  It was kwite nateral that setch an eggspedishing should land in the neybrood of
                     Goose Creek! The brave and nobul-harted Ginral Baker bein dead, and onabul to
                     repel the charge, in coarse the blame is laid onto him; but who ordered him
                     acrost the river? It was a reglar foe paw, as the French
                     say, all round.
                  It seams the rebil ackount of the navel engagement at Baylize was an
                     onmitigated ontruth. The causalties on our side sums up as follers: 
                        Killed—nix.
                        Wownded—nix.
                        Vessels sunk—nix.
                     
                  
                  And when the secesh cumadore slips his wind, and drifts inter Tofit (whar he
                     belongs), nix cum arouse will be the word, and every member
                     of Bellsabub's family will hev a shy at him.
                  Hopen sun to send you intelligents of a hevvy blow on the Potomac, I remain, as

                     been visited by a remarkable and, in fact, eminently diabolical dream. He would

                  WASHINGTON, November 1, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               In common with the ginral publick, you air in coarse awar that Saint John, a
                  profit of the Christian perswashin as reported fur the angils sum sentries ago,
                  ses in his Revelashins as he seen Lucyfur, the Father of Lize, put in iruns for a
                  thousand years, with a distink onderstandin that at the eend of that time he was
                  to be "loosed for a little seesin," and hev full swing at "deceeving the nashins."
                  Now Ime not supperdishus, but last Saturday night, as I laid perfoundly slumberin
                  on the sofy arter my ushil repast of fride iceters and Borebung whisky, I had a
                  very supperisin dreem. Methort the old critter's term was up and he was out on
                  firlo, disguysed as a relieabul gentleman; and was issooing instruckshins to the
                  curryspondents of the dalie press. Wotever he sed rite they
                     rit, jest as reddily as Saint John rit the deskripshins of the
                  lowcusses with the stings in thar tales witch was to torment the airth under the
                  direckshins of Abadun. (See Revelashins, Chapter Nine.)
               Methort the evil sperrit, with a sinstir smild on his bloo lips and a malishus
                  skwint in his wether eye, tutched the Herald's "Speshil" on the
                  sholder and told him to indite a full ackount of the sailin of the grate Union
                  Armady from Hamton Roads. Ses Bellsabub to the Speshil: "The informashin, my
                  frend, will be three or four days in advance of the trooth—but the
                     Herald is my favorite sheet, and Ime bound by a solem oath
                  registered (here he skwinted downards) in a place onmenshinabul to ears perlite,
                  to keep it in advance of everything. The curryspondent winked a cent to the order,
                  and at wunst began to skribble like a moneymaniac. Immediently arterwards I notist
                  old Meffystufferlies in conversashin with the Eggspresses
                  "speshil," tellin him to notify his prenciples to hum, that Ginral Scott,
                  notwithstandin his fizical infirmatiz, was in boystirus helth and sperrits, harty
                  in fack as Hale Columby; also that he wurked fourteen hours a day and was a killin
                  off all his clerks and amenuensenses to the chune of "Old Virginny never tire."
                  The curryspondent lucked kinder doubtful, but the Tempter sed with a grin, "Its
                  all right my boy, the publick nose the Eggspress and depreshiates
                  it accordinly." The speshil ackwiest, and made his manyrandoms as rekwested. The
                  old sarpint then meandered off to whar the Triboon's "Good
                  Ortholity" was sittin onder the shadder of a flapjack hat, strokin his coal-black
                  baird as if he was tryin to cokes an idee outer out.
               "Why so pensiv beluvid," whisperd the Old 'un.
               "I want a subjeck for my necks dispatch," replide Good Orthority.
               "Well," ses the other, takin out his snuff box and treatin hisself to a pilch of
                  sulfur, "the Triboon hes helped me to a numerous
                  number of subjects, and as wun good turn deserves anuther, the resiprossity shant
                  be like the handel of a jug, all on wun side. Tellagraft on that the Seckatry of
                  the grate Navel Flowtiller hes jest eskaped to the enemee with all the sealed
                  orders, maps, charts, plans, and cetery, of the eggspedishing, in his left boot,
                  and that consekently the enterprise is broke up in toe-toe."
               "Consider it, dun," ses Good Orthority, "for by Considerant Ile do it!" (All the
                     Triboon fellers sware by Considerant—jest as the Turks do so by
                  Mayhumit.)
               "Do so," remarkt the Fo of Man, turnin on his heel, "and ef you was to state that
                  when last seen, the fudgetive traitor was swimming cherfully and mity fast up the
                  Cheespeak with a ship's biskit in wun hand and a bottle of Mungoheeler whisky in
                  the uther, and wavin his hat in triump as he paddled along, it would mebbe add to
                  the poplar eggsightment."
               The vishin then peered to change to the tellagraft offiz here, and I seen the old
                  cuss settin in the operate's cheer, srounded with firy flams, and wurkin the wires
                  regardless of eggspence for the bennyfit of the masses. Methort at this moment the
                  hull consarn bust into flinders with an orful crash, and jumpin on eend to find
                  out wot was the matter, I heerd Willard's all-defnin gong a goin like a yung
                  airthquake for airly breakfist.
               Now as I menshint afore, Ime not a blever in the suppernatural, so at fust I only
                  larft at my dreem, witch I sot down to an overharty supper of icesters and too
                  many pulls at the Borebung. But when I cum to see in the collulmes of the New York
                  daylies, eenamost the same stories as I hed heerd Old Brimstun subjest to thar
                  curryspondents in my sleep, ses I to myself, "a few extra horns doosent ackount for the develish
                  kweer coincidents; the words of the drammer is true—thar is more
                  trooth in hevin and airth than is dreamt of in your filosofy."
               Evryboddy here is in a narvus fever about Commydore Dupont's fleet, and all kinder
                  conjecters, is afloat as to the pint it is goin to a sail to. As it will
                  ondoutedly be heern from afore the Sunday Merkary containin this
                  letter ken reach the rebels, I may venter to say, by way of a flyer— 
                     
                        Let the chaps at Fort Macon
                        Take keer of thar bacon,
                     
                   for sumthin will be heerd to drap thar or tharabouts in purty short meter.
                  Likewise I predicate that— 
                     
                        The gents whose full dress is two spurs and a collar
                        Will be licked till they find it convenient to holler.
                     
                  
               
               I wisht I could giv yo the hull programmy, butt a sojers brest is the seat of
                  honor, and Ime onder a promise not to reveal it. Consekently Ive hed to put my
                  predickshins inter misterus rimes like the negromansirs of antickwitty, whose
                  proffersighs is sumtimes kwoted in the perioddiculs as heving ben curusly
                  fulfilled.
               Ginral Scott is now a confirmed valleytudinarian—wotever the flippant informant of
                  the Eggspress may say to the contrary—and is sed he will sun resign the milentary
                  supervishin of his fatherland to a yunger son of Mars. The brave old vetran has
                  airnt a right to repose, and his kentry would be pleased to see him kwietly restin
                  onto his lorils.
               Honest Old Abe is in high fether, and as fall of jokehilarity as ever. I run agen
                  him in Pennlsylvany avenoo this mornin, and arter an old fashined back-woods shake
                  of the hand, he axed me why the battle-field at Bull's Run was like the place whar
                  Magna Carter floored King John. Not noin rightly wot he deluded to, I caved in at
                  wunst, upon witch he gin me a slap on the back and sed it was bekrase it was a
                     runny mead.
               The pint is rather obskewer, but hopen you'll be abel to see throo it, I remain,
                  as on former ockashins,

                  [Last week was particularly barren of events; and in the absense of anything
                     startling in the way of news, the old soldier is unusually didactic. His
                     information respecting the time when, and the place where, General McClellan
                     will mlke his grand attack, may be religiously trusted. The Disbanded, beyond
                     all doubt, is as well posted in regard to the military plans of the
                     commander-in-chief as any agent of the Associated Press; and, in fact, we have
                     reason to know that whatever information he receives from head-quarters is
                     special and exclusive.—EDS.]
               
               
                  WASHINGTON, November 8,1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Butchers shops in fly-time isent more invested with bloobottles than Washington is
                  at present with pollytickle buzzy-bodies as pertends to be the mouthpeaces of the
                  frens of the war. These humbugs huvvers about the guverment offizzes and skoots
                  around the hottels, day in and day out, tryin to pisen the ears of good citysins
                  with thar trumpary tails. It makes me wurmy to hear em blo about the leathergy of
                  the heads of departments. They allow as the kentry long ago eggspected General
                  Maclellin to tackle the rebels in the field, shoulder and elbo, and giv em the
                     coo de grass. "When air we to hev a forrard moovement?" "Is
                  the administrashin asleep?" "This is playin at sogers"—and similar
                  bolderdash is the burden of thar song.
               The same kinder bray was heerd afore Manasses, and from critters of the same
                  stripe. But its no go this time. The commander-in-chief is donkey-proof. The buty
                  of it is that all the yawping and bellyraggin comes from shirkers and
                  nuncumbertents; fellers not wuth a cuss for ennything but cawcussing; skunks as
                  would dekline the swoord for the pen, even ef it was a pig pen; puzzlanymous
                  shoats as would be the fust to save thar bacon by "mooving to the rare to the
                  sound of the enemees cannon." But I needent tell you what they air.
                  You hev heeps of the breed in New York, and they'll never be found, like Uriah, in
                  the "fore-frunt of the battle." Keep em to hum and nake sheriffs of em ef you want
                  to; we hev an overplus of setch blatherskites in this market. Thars wun
                  consolayshin, howsever, we shant hev em long—as sun as the conflick cummenses in
                  airnext, the instick of self-preservashin will send em back whar they belong.
               Nevertheless, ef enny sheep in wulf'f clothin is over ankshus to larn wots the
                  fitin programme, he ken hev it. Ginral Maclellin is agreeabul that all the wurld
                  should no when and whar he intends to strike, and I am
                  orthorised to state the time and place. The time will
                  be—when he's reddy, and the place— whar
                  thars the best chance to go in and win. This is offishal. Wun wurd more to make
                  every things purspickuous and enabul sporting men to bet on a sartainty. The day
                  on witch the grand attact will be made may be found in enny relieabul allmynack,
                  and the percise spot whar the battle will be fit is encluded in all the orthentic
                  maps of the sete of war. It is oney doin justis to myself to menshin that the
                  materials for this candidc eggsposition was not sucked out of the clerks of the
                  War Department, or in ennyways sirupdishously obtaned.
               The President continnees to treat me with the same affeckshinit confidense as
                  uslill, unbuzzuming hisself without reserve at our privet entervews. Last evenin
                  we cum purrty near makin a night of it. In fack, the clock struck two afore the
                  lateness of the hour struck either of us. The witty statesman of the West was in a
                  fine flow of sperrits, and got off numerus chunks of wisdom in the form of
                  dublintenders, cannondrums, and cetery. Ef my memry sarved, you should hev the
                  hull batch, but as it is, I ken oney tickle the rizables of your readers with the
                  follerin:
               Arter we had torked a spell about milentary matters, the venabul, Illannoyan,
                  regardin me witlh a beamin smile, axed me why the commander of Freemount's Boddy
                  Guard must be pernounced a nidiot.
               As I tort he'd shode hisself an all-fired smart feller at Springfield, I sed I
                  couldent see the nub of it.
               "Well," ses the illustrus humorest, "wots his name?"
               "Zagoni," I replide.
               "Troo," ses, he, "and don't we all pernounce him a nidiot when we say he's a
                     goney?"
               "Wots your privit opinyun of Ginral Freemount?" I inkwired, with tears in my eyes,
                  when the larf hed sobsided.
               "Well," he responded. "I say nuthen, but Seckratry Chase thinks he'd
                  be an all-smashin Pathfinder for enny guverment as wanted to diskiver a new road
                  to ruin, and Camerun allows that he doosent keer about hevin Price redoost at
                  setch an alarmin pickayunery sacrifiz."
               The conversashin then turned on the New York eleckshin, and he remarked that Now
                  York appeer from the returns to be a wunderful lawless city.
               "How so?" ses I, rayther riled at the insinnerashin.
               "Why," ses he, "I find that mor'n hafe the peeple as voted for sheriff was reglar
                     Lynchers."
               It was even so, Eddyturs, and I could oney hang my head in shame.
               We then tutched on the embargo, and I axed him wot would be the consekense ef the
                  British merchints was to send out armed ships to brake it.
               "D. V.," ses he, in his dry way, "ef they cum for cotton, we'll giv em plenty of
                     batting."
               Thinkin it was time I put in my ore, I rekwested to no why American prodooce in
                  famnine time was like the approachin London Eggsposishin.
               "Bekase it's the World's Fare," he ansered, kwick as a flash.
               Its onpossible to stump the destingwished woodchopper with ennything in the
                  raillery line.
               Referring to the Navel eggspidishin agen King Cotton, I inkwired, by way of a
                  feeler, ef he sposed it hed got inter Port Royal without damidge; to which he
                  replide, with a solemn wink, that he hoped for the best, but Port Royal was a
                  place whar it wouldent be surprisen to heer of Rex. Seein he was non-cummittal in
                  regard to the Armady, I axed him what he thort of the steamer The Adorer runnin
                  throo our fleet inter Savanna, and a rebel man-o'-war takin nine prizes inter
                  Charlestun in opin daylite. I was eenamost sorry Ide put the kwestin, for the
                  honest ole man shuck his hed glummily, and aloud that he onderstood the
                  blockheading ships hed sheered off in consekense of the sea runnin mountins I
                  high, but he considerd that was at poor way of smoothin it over.
               At this stage of the conversashin he fell inter a musin fit, and seein wot a clock
                  it was, I bid him adoo, and moseyed for Willards. And now biddin you the same, I
                  remane, with three cheers and a tiger for the North,
               
                  Yours allus,

                  [Our correspondent gives us a rousing letter this week. We know it
                     will suit our readers to a dot.—EDS.]
               
               
                  WASHINGTON, November 15, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               "Three cheers and a tiger for the North!" was the conkludin frays of my last
                  letter, and to day, ef vokil intercorse was possabul throo the males, I would
                  saloot you with three setch thunderin
                  derin stunners as ud make your litenin presses dance Juba—tailin off with a growl
                  like a hull jungle-full of royal Bengals on a bender. Ile do it in pen-and-ink,
                  ennyhow. Weve tetched Old Secesh in the raw and weve got him on the hip—and so
                     hip! hip! HIP! HOORAW! Eggskews eggstravagance. The trooth is Ime
                  m setch a state of elevashin, that I feel as ef I should bust my suspenders and
                  rise boddily outer my boots like a Fenicks from its ashes. All the Unionites here
                  is as happy as coons in a cornfield; while the rebel simperthisers are so blamed
                  down in the month that the smilds they take at the bar to drownd thar sorrors
                  doosent put a mite of life inter em, and every fresh rummer as cums in cawses em
                  to groan laudably.
               Last night I couldent git no peace for warlike dreams. Queen Mab was with me, as
                  the play ses, and a crowd of red legs, bagnets, quarterdecks, munkey-jackets,
                  smoke-pipes, dead rebels, and cetery, illoominated with crimson fire, floted afore
                  my sleepin eyes in one bluddy phantasmagory! Drums was in my ears, and the
                  atmosfear was flagrant with sulphur. I stood on the combings of a hatchway and
                  seen the secesh vermin flyin outer Hilton's Head, as the fleet crackt away at em.
                  Then I was at "the eminent deadly breech", as the More of Venus ses, firing inter
                  thar rare. Anon I was haulin down the baby-bunting of Treason, and hysting the
                  full-grown standard of the Union in its place. Finerly, I headed a brilyant
                  cavalry charge from the forecassel of the Warbosh, throo Cumberland Gap inter
                  Kainturky, arrivin jest in time to help the galliant Nelson put the rebels throo
                  at Piketown. The yells I gin doorin this explite broke the nightmare, and I woke
                  up not a little horse, I ken asshure you.
               Hevent the owdashus skunks got an all-crucified belting? Didn't Dupoint make em
                  see ***? Didn't he punktuate thar lines butifully? Who douts now as the shiverally
                  was all "born onsensabul to fear?" Captain Steedman allows that nuther man nor
                  steed can overtake em in a starn chase. He ses the way they put out from the forts
                  was ekwil to Jackson the "American Deer", ef not ekwiller. He tride to fowler em
                  with his tellascope, but the pace was too all-rushin fast to keep em even for a
                  moment within the scoop of his field of vishin. Sevral of the poor devils was
                  found ded in the woods without a skratch. I axed Captain Steedman yesterday mornin
                  wot he thort they died on, and he sed galloping consumpshin.
               About a fortnit ago the Charleston Merkary intermated as the brains
                  of the Administrashin must hev gon a wool-getherin, to think of attacting South
                  Caroliny. Wal, thar hes ben a wool-getherin and no
                  mistake, and I'll go tall thar'll be a cotton-getherin too, afore
                  long. Whars the "bluddy hands" and the "horspitabul graves?" They wasn't on hand
                  at French's Island, and Bay Pint, and Bufort. No sirrees! Thar warn't noboddy in
                  them diggins to "welcum" Uncle Sam but Uncle Sambo. The pomp of war vanisht
                  suddent, and left oney black Pomp behind. The galliant offsirs even went off
                  without thar arms, relyin on thar legs alone. A trail of muskits, bagnets, shakoes
                  and haversacks, shode the way the sojers run. Oney wun shiverally remaned and he
                  wus so disguysed in licker that he sposed noboddy would reckognize him. His
                  condishin may be imadgined from the suckemstance, that when taken he was tryin to
                  light the rong eend of his seegar at a pump, and shakin hands with the handle
                  supposin he hed met a frend as would pertect him agin the "orful Yankees."
               But while Nuthern heroes is kivering tharselves with glory in the South, wot is
                  sum of your white-livered Nuthern eddyturs dooin to hum. Givin "aid and comfort"
                  to the enemee that our troops is discumforted in every battle. By Jeehosyfat! it
                  makes my blud bile. Right afore me as I rite lies a coppy of the
                     Independent, published in your city. Wot does it say? Why that
                  the eddytur is informt as Seward ses the war kant suckseed; that the Europian
                  powers will reckognize the C. S.; that Weed is gon to England to ax the British
                  ministers ef they mean to cotton to the South; that ef they do, our Guverment,
                  bein hopeless of keepin the Union together, will sue for a piece; and that
                  tharupon the kentry will go to destruckshin as ef the devil kickt it. Git the
                  paper, and see ef I hev eggsagerated. In fack it lowers us more than the abuv.
                  Whoever perpetraitord the paragraft, should be sent at wunst either to Fort
                  Laugheryet or to a Loonatic Assilum.
               Then thars that "Muff" of a feller as rites letters here for the
                     Triboon. Honest old Abe, Camerun, and Maclellin, hes all gin him
                  the cold sholder, and ef they gin him the foot insted of the
                     sholder, he would oney get his jest desarts. He ses thars
                     not wun raaly well dessiplind regiment in the kentry, and that the army
                  is a mere mob—both offsirs and men! This is the liebellious stuff he
                  rites for the Triboon, a paper as pertends to be paytriotic! Darn setch snaix in
                  the grass, I say. Let the nashun put its heel on thar misabul heads. But no—let
                  'em crawl. They're not wuth crushing. They kant hurt old E
                        Pluvimus Unum—long may he rain!
               
               Knowin that my vews in this letter will goinside with yourn and the public's, I
                  remain, as ushil.

                  [The old war-horse pitches remorselessly into the Administration—and not
                     without reason—for its tenderness to spies and traitors. Why should not the
                        lex talionis be applied to the traitor
                     eaves-droppers taken within our lines? Union men are harried out of house and
                     home, tarred and feathered, tortured, and in many instances put to death, by
                     rebel ruffians; while Southern spies, caught in the North in flagrante delicto, are treated as prisoners of
                     war! We think, with our indignant correspondent, that rope, is not
                     as prominent feature as it ought to be in the martial policy of the

                  WASHINGTON, November 22, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The thousandds of dollars dispersed by the Guverment for resting spies and
                  pervidin em with evry cumfort at the fashinabul milentalry hottels of Fort Warren
                  and Fort Laugheryet, mought better be infested in shot and shells. It would be
                  jest as eesy to sprinkle down a prayery fire with a New York water-cart, as to
                  stop the rebels' spygame by setch delicut treatment. When we sees a traitor we
                  ushir him inter a present and commojus kage, whar he whissels, and sings and
                  smokes his meresham, and enjies his osham cum dignitraitor on
                  the fat of the land. But ef wun of our emiseries is ketched within the rebel
                  lines, up he goes to the nerdest limb strong enuff to bare his wait. Noboddy tries
                  to git out a rit of Have his Corpus for him; and
                  ef they did, the presence of his boddy in court, arter his sole hed left the
                  airth, would be a useless form. Why kant we take a leef outer the seecesh book,
                  and string up thar spies like inions, ats they do our onfortnit Pilgarlicks?
                  Insted of permitting, em to admire the prospeck from the loopholes of our forts,
                  makee em breefly ackwainted with the landskip through the loophole of a hafe-inch
                  rope, and send em to jine Benny Dick Arnold in a futur State, whar seecesshin is
                  onpossabal—that's my doctering!
               The oney cheep, conveenient and effectall way of dealin with traitor spies is to
                  hang em. They merit deaths and should be treated cordingly. I wouldn't be afealrd
                  to bet my Crymean medal again a South Caroliny major's shrirt-collatr and spurs,
                  thars more'n a hundterd of em in the Deestrick at this moment in reglar entercurse
                  with the enemee. Sum of em is said to keep carryer pidgins, and no sunner is a,
                  grand coo detarmined on by the goverment than the particklers is on
                  the wing to Richmound.
               The fassility with witch suspishus carrickters gits appointments is a caushin to
                  Cabbynets. I met in Pennsylvany avenoo yestday arternoon a Volunteer Kurnil—and
                  he's kwite poplar with the war department too—as I heerd with my own ears torkina
                  red-mouthed seeceshin in a newspaper offiz in New York not more'n six munths ago.
                  And I could tell you of a Kwartermaster, a feller from Tennesee, who sed in my
                  heering arter the takin of Port Sumter, that he was goin back to his nativ State
                  to take up arms agenl the U. S. guverment. Mebbe they're reformed traitors; but ef
                  so thar convarshin was amazin rapid. Howosever I shall keep my eye onto em, and
                  onto three or four more cases of a simildar nater, and ef they sho enny simtums of
                  a relaps, they'll be heerd on at Head Kwarters almity suddent. In the meentime I
                  take the libty of advisin the Seekatry of War and Ginral Maclellin to keep thar
                  eyes skinned, for to my sartin nolledge pollytickle intreeg and
                  pursonal asshurance hes obtained commishins for men who oughter hev solid masonry
                  and bar irun atwixt them and the honest porshin of the publick.
               The seeser of the two rebel plenipenitentaries continnees to be the universal
                  tropic of conversashin, and is warmly disgust. I understand Lord Lyons ses they
                  must be restored right side up with keer to the British Guvment, and in coarse all
                  the jackalls belongin to the legashin barks up the same tree. I hope they'll hev a
                  good time perswadin honest Old Abe to give em up. By the way, Wilkes got off
                  rayther a good things, Ime told, when axed by his Lordship's privit seckratry how
                  he dared to board a British steamer.
               "Wal, my frend," ses the Commydore, in his solem way, "I thort as the Caroline was
                     Mac-Nabbed in American waters, I was jestified, onder the
                  suckemstances, in nabbing the Trent on the high seas."
               The legashin feller dident see it.
               Sumboddy told the story to Prentice of the Looisville Jernil at
                  Forney's party tuther evenin, and that vetran joker remarkt that the rool of tit-for-tat didn't seem to be the
                     Rule Britannia. Assistant Atturney Ginral Coffee sed he
                  dident cunsidder England hed enny grounds of complaint, and Ginral Porter felt
                  sartain that the hull affair would eend in froth.
               It appeers that a curus mistake, originated outer the fast dispatch as arrove here
                  announsin the chapter of Mason and Slydell. It is stated that Wilkes, knowin they
                  were passengers on the British steamer, made up his mind to "brings
                  her too." This gin rise to a report that the San Jasinto hed ackilly brort the
                  Trent inter Hamton Roads with the plenipenitentiaries on board, and the Washington
                  Tellagraft, which never misses a lie by enny axident, would hev spred the preshus,
                  noose from here to Californy afore this time, ef the wire-pullers at the offiz
                  hedent ben stopt by a speshil messinger from the Navy Department! Setch moddest
                  fabels as the romance of the Three Black Crows would be considerd in these diggins
                  near enuff to gospel trooth to administer the oath of alegions on!
               We hev plesent informashin from Kaintucky to-day. The rebel Ginral Zollycougher's
                  troops are desarting bekase they kant get thar pay, and it is sed he finds it
                  onpossabul to raise the wind to replenish his milentary chest. In fack desarshin
                  hes made setch a hole in his army, that he's hed to beat a retreat throo the
                  Gap.
               Intellegence has also ben received at the War Department from Bufort that the
                     delirium trimmings prisoner as was tuck with fits arter the
                  fight, is sloly rekiverin from a state of sincopy and hes exprest a wish to take
                  the oath of fidelity to the constitushin and a glass of red-eye.
               The revew of sixty-five thousand sojers by Maclellin on Wensday was a high old
                  specktickle, and ef the raal tragedy wen it cums off is ekwil to the rehearsal,
                  Bull Run will be tearabully revenged. Trustin as the fitin of our troops will be
                  as good as thars faintin, I remane, wulfishly,

                  WASHINGTON, November 29, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The hurry-up-your-cakes fackshin hes wunst more opend its saft-shell battreres
                  agen the administrashin. "Doos Ginral Maclellin ever mean to stir?" is the cry of
                  the misabul spoons as got us inter hot wnter at Bull Run.
               O! my "forrard movement" frends, dont let your bile overflo. Paws, O milentary
                  Eddyturs; hold your hands, O sevagarus curryspondents as sheds your ink so freely
                  on your native foolscap, for three cents a line—paws and simmer down. You air
                  wasting stayshinnery in attemptin to drive things ahed. The Cummander-in-Cheef
                  doosent keer a bullrush for your diatribes. He's not "a reed shaken by the wind,"
                  and you kant bamboosell him inter raisin Cain afore he feels sarsy abel to fite
                  and conker. Tharfore, you mought as well dror in your horns and stop soundin your
                  battle trumpits.
               Howsever, tho all seems smooth and cam, we air on the eve of mity events, as Adam
                  remarkt to his wife when they fust got thar eyes skinned in the Gardin, and began
                  to look around for a reddly-made clothin store and a mantoomakin establishment.
                  Oney wait tell the rebel meatropolis is removed to Gnashveal and the mouths of all
                  the Suthern harbers is choked with cobble-stuns drapt inter the chaps of thar
                  channils, and then you'll see the grand army showin its teeth in airnest.
               Honest Old Abe is in closte confabulashin with Glulral Maclellin every day, and as
                  I hev the confidense of both, they sometimes permit me (arter hevin repeated the
                  oath to sport and sustain the Constitooshin and give no sucker to the enemee) to
                  take peart in thar counsultiashins.
               A few mornins senst I went with our poplar cheef madgistreet to call on the Ginral
                  at his head-kwarters, and a very plesent, and in fack jolly palavver we hed
                  together; for altho both is church-members, they think, like the famus methodest
                  domino, that the Evil Wun hes no right to hev all the funny games to hisself. When
                  me and the President arrove at the Ginral's house, he warn't up, hevin ben out on
                  a cruse among the rebel posts the evenin afore, besides consumin the midnight ile
                  the night arter his return, in ritin
                  letters. We sent up our keards by an orderly, and he brung us wurd that as sun as
                  the Ginral hed shaved, and tuck a shower bath, and hed his coffee, and red mornin
                  prayers with his milentary famaly, our case wouldc be attended to. I thort it
                  rather curus that he should keep the representative of Uncle Sam watin hafe an
                  hour in the aunty-rum, as ef he'd ben a kentry cussin, but the Presidient oney
                  larfed and sed it was Mac's way—he was a simple-minded republican, and didn't
                  stand on ceremunny with him or enny uther man.
               Presently the Ginral made his apperiance in his dressin gownd and slippers, and a
                  cigar in his mouth, and shuck hands with us as corjally as ef we'd both ben his
                  brothers in arms. We then sot down, and the conversashin at wunst took a gay and
                  spritely turn.
               "Mac," ses the President, "do you know that Seckatry Welles is a gay old boy,
                  notwithstandin his gray hairs and his grown-up famaly?"
               "Howd' you make that out?" replide the ginral, in his short, sharp way; "I've
                  allus onderstud he was considlerd a moddel Christian in the land of steddy
                  habits."
               "For all that he's a Giddy-un," rejined the wittyest of
                  wooodchoppers, smilding vialently.
               "Wal," ses I, wishin to let the seckatry up eesy, for he's a frend of mine, "you
                  mought jest as well hang a dorg as giv him a bad name." I sed that by way of
                  defending the absent, but I thort the President considerd the remark rayther
                     otray, as they say in France, altho he dident say so.
               We then begun to tork of the Port Rile affare, and I axed Mr. Lincoln why
                  Guverment wouldent allow Senitor Simmons, of Rhode Island, to turn a nonest penny
                  by sendin a cargo of noshins to Bufort. Quick as a wink he anserd, "that altho the
                  troops was in want of many things, it warn deemed advisabul that they should hev
                  enny per-Simmons." I judged from the reply, that mebbe the
                  spiritalist Senitor hed benl overly ankshus to repe the frutes of rebellyun. But
                  arter all, why not giv him a chanst? Ef he doosent skin the onfortnit sogers, some
                  sutlerman will.
               The subjeck of Bucannon's defense of hisself by Ex-Aturney Ginral Black arterwards
                  came up, and Maclellin, who is kwite a skollard, remarkt that considerin who it
                  was ritten by anc who it was ritten of, the motto
                  oughter be—from Horace—"nigger est." I pose its to be found
                  somnewhars in the Triboon, but darn me ef I know what
                  it meens, for I was too proud to ax. Howsever I larfed for cumpany's sake. I knew
                  they was runnin a saw on old Buck, and that wast enuff for me.
               At this pint of the conversashin the Venabul Abe, who would rayther get off a good
                  joke than eat, enny time, inkwired of Ginral Maclellin ef he was awar that Ginral
                  Rosecrans was the gratest blackleg in the kentry. Maclellin turnt verry red, and
                  sed twarnt so, sumboddy hed ben slanderin that gallient offsir.
               "My dear sir," replide the President, mildly, with a sly wink of this wether eye
                  at me, "so you considder Floyd, the connon thief, a gallus scoundril?"
               "I do!" said the Ginral emfatically.
               "Wal," rejined Mr. Lincoln, "and warn't he more'n a match for Floyd on the
                     Cheat?"
               I thort Maclellin would hev caterpillerd. He rored tell he was black in the face,
                  and the President had to pat him on the back to bring him too.
               In this kinder dimond-cut-dimond small tork we wild away mebbe an hour or so. Ef
                  it warn't a "feest of resin and a flo of sole," thar never was wum. I wisht I
                  could oney remember hafe the brilyant flashes of genus every speshis as was got
                  of. It was an exhibishin of humorous firewurks more eesily emagined than
                  deskribed. The November meeteors doosent compar with it.
               Subsekwently we went inter serous bizness, and setteld on an actyve programmy for
                  the rest of the camppain. But for the oath prevously deluded to, you should hev
                  the particklers. Suffize it to say that the rebels will get it hot and hevvy.
                  Lucking ankshusly for the blessed crysis when we shall be in a condishin to tickel
                  thar toby, I hev the honor to be,

                  [The account given by our quaint old friend of the altercation between the
                     President and Secretary Cameron is particularly rich and racy. The most

                     hints in the daily papers in relation to the quarrel—or, to speak gingerly, the
                     difference of opinion—between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Cameron, are, we are assured on the best authority, very wide

                  WASHINGTON, December 6, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Thars ben an improovin time here atween Abraham and Simon. I mean, in coarse,
                  atween the hed of the Nashin and the Hed of the War burrow. These two heds hed a
                  lively brush on Sunday. Thar idees clashed on the subject of arming the
                  woollyheds, and arter considabul iffing and butting, they both hauled off without
                  hevin made the slytest impresshin on wunanuther. Honest Old Abe, who deerly luvs
                  his own way and hes a hart as tender as a biled turnip, wanted Camerun to alter
                  his vews about setting the blacks onto the whites, warupon, as I onderstand, the
                  Sekatry declined to make the alterashin and the follerin altercashin ensood.
               ABE.—Sir, the Slavery mancipashin questen is a notty pint. Thars a split on it now
                  in the North, and what you say in your report about armin the niggers and settin
                  em on to mall thar masters, would oney act as a wedge to widen the fisher. You air
                  not axed for opinions, sir, but oney for statements. Ef
                  your dockyment was to go to Congress ondockt, all the consarvativs would say I was
                  barkin up the same tree as yourself, and I should be railed at as onworthy of my
                  post by all the Suthern Unionists. You must dock off that porshin of the tail eend
                  of your report whar you say it may be the "dooty" of the Guverment to "arm and
                  ekwip" the darkeys. Sir, I insist upon it.
               SIMON.—Mister President, I owe it to myself to say it kant be dun. I wont take
                  back a sillybull. Ive sent the report to the papers with orders for it to go in,
                  and tharfore it must cum out. War to the nife and the nife to the
                     hilt is my watchword, and ef you want to play at push-pin with
                  rebellyun, insted of smitin the Fillistins hip and thigh, you must git anuther
                  Seckatry of War.
               ABE (sourcastically).—The jaw of an ass, Mr. Seckatry, isent as
                  powerful a weepin now as it was in the days of Samson and the Fillistins, and
                  tharfore IMne ankshus to hev the objeckshunabul claws struck out. It is onwurthy
                  of your talons as a statesman. Suppose your blud is up—it is your
                  bizness as a pollytishen to dror it mild.
               SIMON.—Mr. President, the remarks you kwarril with in my messidge to Con—I mean my
                  report to you—was not dictated by mollevolence nor wicked annymosity, but by a
                  Simon Pure regard for that high old morrill precept: "The eend sankshins the
                  means." The whining pollytishins as blubbers at the idee of armin the blacks, is a
                  set of hypercritical Charlotans, and nuthin shorter. Could the bluddiest of
                  Afrikins act more like devils ingarnet, than the white blackguards of South
                  Caroliny, and Georgy, and Alabammer hes acted. Why should we treat them with
                     bon hominy and considerashin, when they thretten to hyst the
                  black flag, and refuse to giv up the ded boddies of our slain frends, and thrust
                  thar prisners of war inter unholesum dungins, whar they shoot em throo the
                  winders, and lear with butcherly eyes at evry Nutherner that passes throo thar
                  streets, cryin "Kill! kill! kill!"
               ABE.—Enuff of this Mister Camerun—and rayther more. I am President of
                  these United States—not you. Ef you think Ime a poppit to foller the
                  moshins whenever Simon ses wiggle-waggle, youve mistaken your man. Ef twenty four
                  millyuns of honest Nuthern Unionists kant flax out six millyons of ongrateful
                  Suthern rebils without a servile war, the angler-Saxon race isent fit to hold the
                  rod of Empire even on this side of Mason and Dickson's line.
               SIMON.—Well, Mister President, all I hev to say, in conclushin is, that even ef my
                  report should caws my discharge, I wont alter it.
               ABE.—You needent go off at hafe cock, Mister Seckatry. Ime not goin to dismiss
                  you—at least not rite away; but I shall wipe out your nigger-armin subjestshin,
                  previus to sendin the dockyment to Congress.
               SIMON (rayther sulkily).—Well, do as you like, I see we kant set up
                  our hosses together.
               ABE.—Never mind, my frend, so long as you fatten yourn at the public crib.
               SIMON (savagely).—Say, Mister President, you're fond of cannondrums,
                  ken you tell me why youre like the North Wind.
               ABE (playfully).—Mebbe its bekase you find me purty cutting, Mister Camerun.
               SIMON (malishusly).—No, Sir, its bekase youre a "blustering railer."
               ABE (coolly).—Very good, Mister Seckatry—and do you know why youre
                  like a sartain profit as was swallered by a whale?
               SIMON (reflectively).—Prehaps bekase I shall be hard to keep down
                  and may turn up all right when least eggspected.
               ABE (in his usual sly way).—No, but bekase I shall throw you
                  overboard whenever setch a sackrifice is nessesary to asswage the storm. You would
                  hev to go, my frend, ef the publick good
                  reckwired it; so you'd better squar your pollysee by my wishes, my Simlon, ef you
                  want to be Simon—bar Jonah!
               Eggsit Simon. Abe whissels, and the curtin falls.
               The President is in better luck than the old man in the Donkey fabil. His Messidge
                  tickels eenamost evrybody, without it is the rebels, and in coarse it is intended
                  to tetch them in the raw.
               Within a fortnit; mebbe within a week, you'll hear of a big thing in the way of a
                  skrimmage not a hunderd milds from these diggins. Onless Bowerygard and Johnstun
                  back down, thar'll be a battle on the Sulphurino skale afore New Years, jest as
                  shure as Bellsabub beleeves in brollin brutal braggarts in brimstun. I could say
                  more but mnums the word ontil the fo is beaten to a mummy.
               You hed a jolly time in New York I larn over Opdike's elecksin. Well you hev a
                  rightl to holler now youre outer the Woods —both Fernando and Benjamin. Thar was
                  plenty of cheatin on thar side I spose, but the lottery policy doosent dror a
                  prize in pollyticks every time.
               Hopin that a new erie is commensing in witch all time-sarving humbugs will be

                  WASHINGTON, December 13, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Ime afeard the omnipleasant nigger is gone to make trubble here this winter. Thars
                  sed to be a congresshinal majority in favor of placin our arms in his hands and
                  makin a milerntary cumraid and bruther of him. A sartain New England Sennytur hes
                  redooced the propersishin to black and white, and intends to interduce a
                  woolley-head Bill in the Sennit, embracin his idees. Wun thing is beyond
                  contraversy—natmely that publick opinyun here is very vicey
                     versy. Ef Congress passes the meshur, the President will probly cum
                  down on it with his offishal niggertive. Mutch as I admire our Afrikin friend I
                  don't think we could afford to swop the best white sojer in the Union for him, and
                  as Ginlral Maclelin would onquestenably resine ef Sambo was put in uniform, I
                  predicate we hed better let our ebony faller creturs shell corn, and our white
                  brethren with har on their heads shell the rebels. The Sunday
                     Merkary I bleve is slitely inklined to carry Afrikry inter the war, and
                  so far as sholderin "de shovel and de ho" to dig ditches and raze airthwurks is
                  consarned, I go in for it too; but when it cums to sholderin the musket, thars no
                  culler or resin for it, when we've got six hunderd thousand white fokes in the
                  feeld. Prehaps the best thing we ken do with our Ethiopian cussin is to wurk him
                  and pay him doorin the war, and send him whar he ken keep himself too himself
                  afterwards. Sum years ago we was goin to buy the Sandwitch Ilands. Why wouldn't
                  that be a fust rate locashin for "persons held to serve us," as the Constitooshin
                  hes it? Arter bein treated all their lives as Sons of Ham, they would in Coarse be
                  glad to be colonized among the Sandwitches.
               Good tidins is looked for frum the Mussysippy purty recently. The gunboat squadron
                  is now reddy, and ef the flowtiller doosent git inter a tight place, or run agen a
                  snag, the Father of Waters will sun be ourn from St. Louis to whar it debauches
                  inter the sea. The advantidge of this moovment must be a parent to all, fbr at
                  present we oney hold the river to Cairo, heving so far found it onpossabul to get
                  a step father.
               Orders hes ben isssod, I onderstand, to raise the rebel blockhead on the lower
                  Potomac, and Bragadear Ginral Sickles is sed to be on the Key veve
                  for a brush with the disunionists in that rejin. He's a fine man is Ginral
                  Sickles, and ef he's as mutch beloved by his sojers now as he was when on Staten
                  Iland, thar isent wun of em as wouldent cherfully fowler him to his deth.
               Abe and his lady is both in salubrus helth, and feel confident that the North and
                  South, will shortly lay down together as the lion and the lamb did in Pairodice,
                  afore the lamb was awar that the lion had a hanklerirn arter mutton. The venabul
                  Head of the Nashin hes been a good deal intersted in the Bible kwotashins lately
                  published in the noosepapers. He was naterally indignant to find em bogus, and
                  that he had sairtched the skripters in vain. But it warnt altogether in vain
                  nuther, for he informt me he hed drived great consolashin from the Book of Sams,
                  and speshily from Sam Forty, verse seven. On turnin to the passidge I found these
                  sole refreshin words "MANASSES IS MINE," witch I hope it will proove so. I subjested howsever that ef we
                  kommence firing texts at the Sutherners they mought giv us as good as we sent ef
                  not more so. Frinstance ses I, run your eyes over Isayer, and in wun of the
                  chapters youll diskiver the follerin sentence "I will say to the
                  North giv up." He peered to be rather tuck aback by the langwedge of the profit;
                  so I told him by way of a flyer that accordin to Doctor Cheever, it meant as the
                  North should giv up to the abelishinists.
               The yung grandsuns of the late Loose Fillup seems to enjoy tharselves here,
                  drinkin thar bumpers of shampain and shatter margo, and actin as aids to the
                  ginral-in-chief. No dout they'll do thar dooty when it cums to hard nocks, and
                  realize the hopes of thar galliant uncle the Dook of A Maul. The Prince of Sam
                  Sam, late of Prooshia, is also figgering around considabull, and thars several
                  Hungry counts as wants to be counted in when the time cums for pitchin inter the
                  secesh humsteds. Sum on em I suspeck warnt of much a count whar they formally
                  belonged. But war brings all sorts of furrin ware to the surfiz. I met a German in
                  a major's uniform in Willard's Sally Manger yesterday, as I seen
                  standin opposit Saint Paul's church in New York not more'n two months ago, with a
                  basket full of young puddle dorgs for sale.
               As was to be andizzypated, John Bull was tuck with a verteego it seems when he
                  heered of Slydell and Mason's captor, but I reckin arter tossen his horns a spell
                  he'll dror em in. Nobody here is skared a mite about the maggot he's got inter his
                  head. Let him take keer we don't hawl him over the coals for aiden and cumfurten
                  the vile incinderary, Pegram and his feller pirits.
               Trustin that a collushin with the enemee will come off afore the contractors hev
                  sacked all the Guvernments reddy rino, I remane with grate devoshin to the
                     Sunday Merkary, the President, and the Nayshinal Egul,

                  WASHINGTON, December 20, 1861.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               So the British lion's tail's a waggin, and the wun horned fablus animal as doos
                  the Circus pony bizness on the uther side of the English diedam has assumed a
                  buttin attitood and the munkey of the hull Rile menadjery is considabully up. The
                  sellybrated American War Fowl, as makes his nest in the thunder cloud, and roosts
                  on a streek of litenin, and looks the blazin sun right in the eye, is also
                  eggsighted—sum. But Ile bet a gold peace to a Bellona sossidge, thar wont be no
                  war. I spose all the Wall street fineseers and stock-jobbers is brakin out in
                  goose pemples at the thort of it. Tell the misabul moneymaniacs to cam thar
                  felines and not let the threts of the British press to give us rats wurry em
                  enny.
               Evrybody sposed that snakin the rebel plenipenitentiaries from onder the British
                  flag would caws an angry crow from evry cockney Chapman. When the Trent reached
                  the Thames in coarse thar was an orful moovin of the waters. But tho John Bull's
                  choler was up, his best stock went down, witch shows that altho a stiff-necked
                  animal, the idee of a fight with the Yankees gin him a pain in his pocket. Thar'll
                  be an allmity big tork, but no shindy. Weve no time to tend to outside bizness
                  till the Cotton States is faxed out, and John, arter considerin the barings of the
                  hull matter over his pipe and his pewter, will find out that the game aint worth
                  the taller, and be in no hurry to pitch inter his best customer without resin. I
                  calkilate tharfore that arter an all-thunderin waste of paper and red tape, it
                  will all eend in asshoorances of the most distingwished considerashin.
               The thing hes got to be argufied, ennyhow. I like Wilkses grit, but ef that son of
                  Neptin went further than he'daughter, the missdeed must be disclamed and Brittania
                  mollyfied. Loose Napollyon proposes, they say, to act as abittraitor, and as he
                  wunst was a London perleeceman he aughter know how to keep the peace. Sum thinks
                  he'd be glad to jine England, ef she's inklined for a crewsaid agen us, to give
                  emplyment to his sirplush navy and divert the publick mind from hum affairs.
                     Its my opinyun as the nevvy of his
                  unkil is rayther in a bad fix; but with an empty treshury I dont see
                  how he ken help England or even hisself, onless he goes to his unkil at the
                     Mount de Piety and puts his regaly up the spout to raise the
                  wind.
               But ennyways its our place to calkilate all the chances and keep cool. In the
                  present crysis, brotherly felines and consillytory purceedins tords furrin powers
                  is our dooty as devoted Christians. When weve roped in the South we kin tend to
                  the Europyens (darn em!), but not afore. "Peace on airth and Good Will to Men,"
                  should be the nayshinal watchwurd ontil arter Jeff Davis, Floyd, Pickens and
                  cumpany, is hung.
               Bennett I notis is dooin his darndest to help his Suthren frends, by urgin the
                  North to get up a war with England. The seeceshers here say he's the trooest frend
                  they hev on the footstool, and that altho the Suthern pus is rayther low, he hes
                  oney to speak ef he wants more of the yaller stuff outer their corrupshin fund.
                  They're not without gratitood—these rebels. I hope no harm will ever happen to
                  Bennett; but if thar doosent, its a pruff that the "wages of sin" hes ben
                  considabully redooced sense the New Testament was issood.
               I hed a long confab with Honest Old Abe yestday arter he receved the dispatches by
                  the steamer. His spirts was as good as wheat, and he got off several cannondrums
                  of the loudest kind. He was about hafe way throo with a speshil messidge to
                  Congress and he axed me why it warn't like the Bible. I caved in without a
                  neffort, and he sed with an engagin smile, that it disresembled the Bible bekase
                  it warn't wholly writ.
               Then he worked away on his onfinished messidge for a wile; but held up suddently,
                  as ef sumthin hed occurd to him, and inkwired ef I knew why his pen was like his
                  cabbynet.
               "I reckin," ses I, "it's bekase it's fust rate and goes along smooth and
                  easy."
               "No, my slo frend," he replide sharply, "the resin is thars an onwriteous big
                     split in it."
               "But," ses I, "obnockshus Cabbynet advisers isent like pens."
               "Why not?" ses he.
               "Bekase," ses I, with a confidenshal wink, "they hev never ben considerd
                     stationery."
               The blessed old man larfed all over. It doosent take much to tickel him.
               When he hed cumposed hisself, I axed him wot sort of an anser was goin out to the
                  British guverment to-day, remarkin that ef it was onderstood the Canarder hed
                  carrid out an onfavorable vorable reply thar'd likely be some lame ducks in Wall
                  street afore long.
               He promply rejined that thar was nuthin in the dispatches per Afriky to warrant
                  enny black forebodins.
               "Is the blasted plenipenitentiaries to be gin up?" ses I (I couldent help it).
               "We shall purtest agin it ef we do it!" he responded.
               "So will the nashin, Ime afeard," ses I.
               "Mebbe so," he exclamed, thortfully; "but it's all for the best."
               "Couldent we keep wun of the hang-dog raskils?" ses I, feroshusly;
                  for I felt real turmy at the idee of thar squirmin outer our hands. "Couldent we
                  giv em Mason and keep that slippery son of a soap-biler, Slydell, who's as full of
                  lies as wun of his father's vats?"
               "Ah!" ansered the venabul statesman, "I know wot your felines is, old boy, and
                  mine's jest as wulfy. But we kant afford lucksirees at present. We must finish one
                  shindy afore we pitch inter anuther."
               He was right, Eddyturs, he was right; but rath will keep ef its bottled up
                  keerfully for futur use; and in the meantime we kin let the South hev a few vials
                  of it, hot and hevvy.
               All the bar-rum pollytishins here is torkin turkey about seesin Canady, and
                  smashin things genally, in the Herald stile; but thar'll be no war,
                  and that ile gambol on.

                  The fire and vigor which usually characterize the letters of the spunky Old
                     Soldier are not as conspicuous as usual in the following communication. It
                     seems as if the concessions made, or to be made, by our Government to John
                     Bull, on account of the Trent aiffir, and the do-nothing policy of the military
                     authorities at Washington, had produced a depressing effect on the spirits of
                     the brave old man. We fear that the Grand Army of the Potomac is
                     destined to inglorious inaction for the next three months—though we
                        hope otherwise. No wonder that our veteran eran friend chafes at the idea of
                        hybernating within a few hours' march of an enemy inferior in
                     numbers, poorly clothed, and by no means a match for the Federal cohorts either
                     in artillery-practice or in close encounter. He cannot understand it—neither
                     can we—either can the People.—EDS.]

               Poplar fury sun rises to a grate hight in this kentry, but altho we git up a tree
                  allmity rapid (as is the case ginally with, people, in ardent climes), yet our
                  eggsightment kwickly sobsides, and then we air willin to consider the subjeck
                  cooly in all its branches. Setch has ben the case in the Sam Jasinto and Trent
                  dissentshun. At fust our Ebbynesir was up, and even I went it on the loud for an
                  emute with Enland. Naterally emuff in the fust instants, we thort John Bunll
                  wanted to take advantidge of our differculties, and we called him a mean cuss; but
                  as sun's we sor he manyfisted a dispersishin to disgust the matter in an amacobble
                  sperit, our guverment sed at wunst with the utmost libralty and afability—"Spit it
                  out, Old Buffer, and ef youve been ronged in a matter of ettiketty, we'll make it
                  all right, right away." John, who isent a bad feller, considerin he's a furriner
                  and doosent speak English as good as we do, was mitily sweetend up by this mark of
                  candysenshin, and replide, "Hi hassent—Hime satisfied." So the rumpuss may be
                  lucked on as over, and all danger of bluddy catastrophy at an eend.
               Seward, they do say, hes played his keards thunderin crafty in this bizness. He
                  represented to the British ambassydor that nuthin would please Loose Napollyon

                  coarse, that Brittannia, in the end, would ketch tartar. As Lyons hates the Empror
                  wus than pisin, this vew of the case gin a soft and silky turn to the
                  negoshiashins, and the way they handeld the kwestin was all-flatterin smooth end
                  plesent that noboddy could a sposed thar was enny sharp claws onderneath the
                  velvet.
               Ginral Scott's letter, too, dun a heep of good, and his return from Payris with a
                  sekrit messidge to our Guverment from L. N. was jest in the nick of time to
                  prevent an Internayshinal mill, or, as a Cockney sed to me at Willard's to-day, it
                  was "singlarly hoppertune."
               The sojers at Arlinton Hights feested high on Christmas Day. Ime afeard thar isent
                  poltery enuff left for seed in that neybrood, Gobblerrrs was confisticsated, ducks
                  was abduckted, fouls was onfairly dealt with, and I calkilate from wot I heerd of
                  the explites of our brave defenders among that speeshy of birds as wunst saved the
                  Capital, that most on em is sound on the goose.
               Every entrenchment was a Fort Pickings, and when it cum to an attact on the winces

               Wile the rank and file was eggsirpsizin thar teeth on the fetherd creashin without
                  distinckshin of age or sect, the offsirs was bankwetting at thar kwarters, and by
                  all ackrounts they dident do things by haves. They sellybrated the jovil ockashin
                  with few de joys of shampain and wished wun anuther menny happy

                  when he goes on a lark inter the clouds. Not as enny on em got tite and went in
                  for a bust. They kept tharselves right side up with keer; and ef the fo hed cum
                  they would hev found em cummy fo. In coarse the gals they left

               The rest is purty much in the same vane—most on em bein clamrush for a forrard

                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Sartainly we Americans air Jobs, every man of us. Sum few may chafe and feel sore
                  at the idee of never cumming to the scratch with the enemee, while the kentry is
                  goin to the devil, but the Nayshin in ginrral bares it all with a payshint smild.
                  A millyun of dollars is payed out daily, and wots to show for it? Wunst a week or
                  so, thars a skrimmidge sumwhbars, and mebbe twenty or thirty rebels killed and
                  wownded and mebbee not. Evry secesher we rub out costs the North about a hunderd
                  thousand dollars, and prisners of war, at the lowest figger, fifty thousanld
                  dolors a peace. Ef you no of enny mathermatishin as ken callkilate the cost of
                  flaxin the South, accordin to that skatle of prices, I wisht you to hev it dun,
                  bekase I think a skwint at the sum totil mought wake up the American peeple, and
                  show em the pressopeace tords witch thar drivin.
               An aiveridge dividend of not more'n thirty ded rebels a week, on a weekly
                  dispersement of millyuns of dolors, peers at the first glanst rayther a slim
                  return. But I hope noboddy wurries about it, bekase purty sun the tacks-getherers
                  will be along and then we shall pay all our dets down on the nall, andl ef we
                  chuse to give the hyest price for milentary lucksirees, whose bizness is it?
                  Hevenzt we all ben makin our piles for the last kwarter of a sentry, and aint we
                  eenamost tired of seein em grow and mountin gard over em? Isent thar gold enuff in
                  Califoray and Oregon, and cetery to remunnyrate the brave defenders of our kentry
                  and satisfy the multitood of all-fired theeves that naterally belongs to a grate
                  milentary establishment Can't we dig it up and fork it over jest as eesy as
                  shuvelling peach-blows outer a tater-patch? So ef we want to play at war on the
                  protracted meetin prencepul, wots to hender us?
               The last parrygraft is intended sourcastically. Sourcasm, they say, is a powerful
                  weepin, and ef I ken use it so as to gode my kentrymen outer thar leathargy, and
                  indooce them to lift up thar vices and make tharselves heerd by the
                  slow-comotives, and doo-nuthins at Washington, I shant waste my stashinery in
                  vain. Cheatin and robbery of a nater as would dror tears of indignashin from the
                  eyes of State Prison convicks, flurishes in evry department of the public sarvis,
                  from sutlers up to seckatries, and thar's no chanst of the conflicts bein brort to
                  a close while it continnees.
               As long as the War Goose lays goldin eggs in the nest of corrupshin, thar'll be
                  plenty of cacklin, but no concloosiv fightin. Upon the honor of an old sojer, as
                  never tuck the vally of a chaw of tobacker over and abuv his jest doo, I bleve
                  that ef sum twenty of the mercynary hangers on of the guvermenmt could be strung
                  up without mercy on Capitol Hill to-morrer mornin, it would do more to shorten the
                  war than a big victry over the insirgents. And mark wot I say!—it will cum to
                  sumthin of that kind in the eend. Ef the guverment doosent make a vertoo, of
                  necessty, the peeple will. When the skrews is put to evry man's individual pocket
                  by the federal collectors, let the all-plunderin vagabones of contractors luck to
                  thar necks. The hemps growd and twisted that'll strangel sum of em yet. Isacur is
                  ant ass that stoops atween two burdins. He ken stagger allong cherfully wonder
                  stagnashin in trade and the fare cost of a war, but ef on top o' that you keep a
                  pilin the devil's own extrees till his back bone begins to crack, up goes his
                  blessed old heels at last, and then bewar of the exassprated animal.
               I reckin that outer the three hundred and odd millyuns of dolors eggspended senst
                  last starch, a good seventy-five millyuns, hes gon in cheatins, shavins, and
                  theevins. The itumns will never be known tell the grate day when all ackounts is
                  balanced, and the sheep hes the satisfackshin of seein the bily-goats as butted
                  them on airth sent whar they belong.
               
               I persoom the swindlel on hosses alone amounts to considabul over a millyun, and
                  as to the shoddy shave, ef you put it down at the moderat aivridge of five dollars
                  a man for the hull army, thrar's three millyuns more. Evrything else hes ben
                  furnisht on the same paytriotick skale of profits, and in the West it is sed at
                  very purty bizness is dun in sellin fewill to the guvernment agents at twenty per
                  cent above its vally, and then stealin it and sellin it to em agen at a small
                  advance on the oridgenal swindel. I hevent heerd of ennyboddys bein hauled over
                  the coals for pursuin this new cut-and-cum-agen sistem of dliggin inter the
                  treshury, but I larn on the contrary from a frend in Congress that it is spoken of
                  as a remarkabul speciment of American genus by sum of the guverment offishalls,
                  and that ef the inventor was to apply at the paytent offis he could git the right
                  skewerd to him for all the Nuthern States without the slytest trouble.
               Honest Old Abe's hands is clean, but wot ken he do? He pilots the ship of state as
                  well as he nose how, but; the pirits is too strong for him. While he stands at the
                  hellum theyre all the while brakin cargo, and onless he hed as many eyes as he hes
                  hars on his skalp, he couldent watch the theeves on the kwarter deck, to say
                  nuthin of the gangs of villins continally swarmin up the sides, and snakin thar
                  way throo the port holes, and swimmnin around to grab wotever thar frends on board
                  lets down over the starn and bulwarkrs, and throo, the cabbin winders. Congoess,
                  howsever, ken do sumthin, and onless it takes meshers to save the owdashis
                  skroundrils from popular fury, by providin for thar saift-keepin in jails, why
                  then, as I sed afore, thar'll be a hangin match wun of these days that'll astonish
                  all corrupshin. Ef the peeple wunst takes the job in hand, I dont seema to think
                  as high conneckshins at Washington will save sum of the cheef plundermungers from
                  makin an improvin eend wonder the awespecies of a vigilants committee. Ive seen
                  better men jerked inter etarnity in Californy, for stealin losses and setch, and
                  thar bodies pitched inter a trench like ded dogs by the peeple in Committee of the
                  Hole.
               It is rummerd around that thars to be andvance of the main army in about two
                  weeks, but I shell never bleve it ontil I hear the drums beat and the trumpets
                  blow. The ginral opinyun of thortful men is that the last trumpet
                  will sound afore thars a forrard moovement.

                  WASHINGTON, January 24, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               A sartain small beer Washington curryspondent as delites in brewin mischeef,
                  fizzles out the follerin in yestday's New York Times. He ses Mr.
                  Lincoln remarkt to a frend "that his privit conversashins was not for
                  noosepapers," and likewise that "nuthin from him was wuth repeating onless it hed
                  'Abraham Lincoln' sined to the bottom."
               In coarse this spurt of bitterness is intended as a slop at me. It is fablus and
                  liebellious—wull of the numerus shoddy statements witch the "relieable gentlemen"
                  as wurks by the yard for the daylie press is continually manoofactoring outer hole
                  cloth.
               The fact is that the ornary noosepaper curryspondints here is jellus of the
                  eggsalted opinyun entertaned of me by the Eggseggative. My standin at the seat of
                  guverment is higher'n theirn. Mr. Lincoln never axes enny of that class of suckers
                  to a teat-a-teat with him in in his privit sanktum. He doosent waste his
                  cannondrums on the criters, for he is well awar that ef wun of his button-busters
                  was fired amung the crowd from the mouth of a ten-inch Parrot, the hit wounldent
                  be appreshiated.
               I hev the highest orthority for sayin that my frend Abe never remarkt, or thort,
                  or suspected, or hed the idee, or eggspects to hev, that nuthin from him is wuth
                  repeatin onless it hes his name to it. Contrarywise, he thinks,
                     I think, and thinkin men in ginral thinks, that the offishall
                  dockyments baring his signatoor doosent cumpair with sum of his wittyschisms

                  mity keerful how he pervokes anuther rub from me. Wun wurd more in vindicashin of
                  Mr. Lincoln. The ties subsistin atween us will not permit me to see him dragged
                  afore the publick in a false posishin. A New York jernil ses he deklard last week
                  as he hedent peroozed a noosepaper for a munth. Taint so. He reeds the
                     SUNDAY MERKARY evry week, and the Newport News tellagrafic
                  dispatches evry day and bein as oncapabul of an ontruth as Metamora the Forrest
                  Child, its not sposable that he made the remark a scribed to him.
               The affair at Mill Crick, Kaintucky, hes elevated our sperrits. The tedeum, of
                  suspense hes ben suckseeded by the songs of Victry. It will thrill the hall kentry
                  from the Chain Bridge at Washington to the Goldin Gate of Californy! Fourteen
                  hunderd mules tuck, arter an obstnit resistance! What will Manasses say to that?
                  Ken the rebels continny the war for menny long 'ears, at that rate? I predicate
                  not. And the flyin fo couldent wait for the waggins. We've got em all it seems. As
                  to thar artillry forces, our men smasht em and skewerd all thar heviest
                  pieces.
               Ginral Thomases name is on evry lip here, and Ginral Schoopf's would be ef enny
                  boddy could pernounce it. The oney way to do it is to say Shope, and then put your
                  upper teeth over your onder lip, and giv setch a ptiff as the old wumman did when
                  she tried to blow the candle out. Wal, it deserves a puff at the eend,
                  ennyhow.
               The fust ackounts of the fight, bein exofishy (ike 0. C. Kerr's from the Mackarel
                  Brigade), was not bleved by a single sole, but evry shadder of dout was soon
                  dizzypated by dispatches from hed-kwarters. The fact that our Ginral Fry hes
                  settled Zollycuffer's hash, creates more feline amnung the aristocratick rebel
                  symperthisers here than the suckumstance of three hunderd of the rank and file
                  bein made mincemneat of. Seecesshin hes hed a lofty fall, and no mistake. A few
                  more setch Somersets, and its back-bone'll snap.
               I onderstand that Mrs. Greenhow and Mrs. Baxley, the two captive dullsinners as
                  feels setch a deep intrest in Jeff Davis and the uther Suthern Nights of the
                  Rueful Countenance, hes worn crape on the left arm sents the noose of the Union

                  WASHINGTON, January 31, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Peers to me ef this war continnees long enuff, Floyd and Toucey may loose thar
                  repitashin as A number 1 theeves and skoundrils. Thars fellers here as is hard
                  onto the heels of them hullsall depredators, and onless sum of em is brort up with
                  the hangman's lasso purty sun, I dont no but theyll be chorks a head afore the
                  Union's saved. Menny thinks as the Navy Department wants sobbing out. Sendin
                  honest; patryits to see in setch traps for the onwary as the transports as was
                  nocked to peaces, or rayther as fell to peaces, on the cost of North Caroliny, and
                  furnishin of em with water in Kerosene oil casks, is a combinashin of enterprise
                  and wilful murder, as wouldn't be past over in silence by Nayshins in ginral.
                  Mebbe its the folt of my Californy edicashin; but it doos seem to me that whar
                  orful sufferin and loss of life cums of theeving, a little hangin would be an improovin specktickle.
                  When I was prospectin at the mines, I used to think that Lynch Law was oncivilized
                  and perumptory, but senst Ive mingled in sosity at Washington Ive cum to vew it in
                  a milder light.
               The buty of the raskality that prevales onder our enlitened guverment is that the
                  sponsability rests nowhars. The swindlin in the War Department hes ben of a natur
                  and extent to make a saint blastfeem, but the Seckatry cums outer the sink of
                  inickity with outer a stain on his offishall garments. He hed nuthin to do with
                  the contracks. It was the heads of the burrows. And the heads of the burrows puts
                  it onto the guverment agents, and they put it onto the devil, I spose. Then the
                  Navy Department begins to smell fishy, but the late Postmaster and small
                  politishin of Hartford, as navigates the consarn, doosent ketch the flavor of it
                  even when Congress stirs up the corrupshin onder his nose.
               As to Congress, it seems to be takin a cumfortable snooze rite on the edge of a
                  fienanshil volcany. Guverment credit is goin to Tofit both to hum and abrod, and
                  the tax bill witch is the oney pennysea for the evil, hangs by the ilids in a
                  doo-nuthin committy. O! its enuff to make enny troo American swar in church, to
                  think how this great and glorus kentry is bully-ragged and molltreated and
                  kwack-doctered, in her hour of differkulty. It doos seem as ef the breed of our
                  great men and troo patryits had gin out with the Clays and Websters, and that oney
                  rubbish remaned behind. The idee of puttin a stomp dooty on noosepapers shows what
                  sort of critters hes been sent to Congress from sartain deestricks. Howsever I
                  dont bleve the House hes arrove at setch a pitch of loonacy as to pitch hed
                  foremost inter the press. Ef it should I reckin the Sennit would hev the gumpshin
                  to put a stopper on the meshur, and failin that surely Old Abe would stomp his
                  foot down on setch an act of wus than furrin desputism.
               But I ken tell you, Eddyturs, thars a gang of onscroopalus raskils here, as is
                  wurkin day and nite to git a claws inter the ginral tax bill that'll kill the
                  kentry press. The heads of the moovement is the emiseries of a sartain New York
                  press whoos artickles recommendin the confisticashion of English property hes
                  ruined our credit in England and indooced the holders of our skewrities thar to
                  sell out as fast as they ken. This consarn eggspects to make $200,000 a year by a
                  stomp dooty ef it ken be put throo, and more'n a duzzin agints is lobbyin like
                  devils ingarnet to effeck that objeck. The President is in a cherful frame of
                  mind, but Ime sorry to say hees gettin to be rayther obstnit. The old man and the
                  Sennit doosent goinside in thar vews. Frinstance they censhur his partickler frend
                  and former pardner Mr. Layman, the marshil of the Deestrick, and the Eggsegative
                  by way of hittin back, makes him master of the serimonies at the White House, when
                  the Sennyturs call to pay thar respecks. Sum ses this is acten with dignifide
                  firmness, but uthers as hev no axes to grind, give it a diffrent name witch my
                  intimit relashins with the President up to the present time, forbids me to put in
                  black and white. Possably he may giv me the cold sholder for main these
                  remarks—but publick interests afore privit frendship.
               I notis by the late noose from Dixie that the buty and fashion of seeceshy is
                  invited to contriboot the old woolins of thar wardrubs, to make cattridges to
                  shoot the northin mudsills. Flannel pettycotes and Balmorall skearts thankfully
                  receved at the rebel war offiz, witch bein in a pawper condishin cant afford to
                  buy the stuff to rap its ammynishin in. This fack takin in conneckshin with the
                  sad intelligence that the childrin of the F. F. V.'s is runnin about the streets
                  of Richmound bar-foot, and that the toes of the highest sirkels is, as a ginral
                  thing, throo thar boots and gayters, must be very gallin to the natral aristocrazy
                  of the land. Ime afeard ef the war lasts a year longer, thar'll skarse be duds
                  enuff for decency among the shiverally and thar wives and darters. When it comes
                  to takin the wimmins pettycotes for gun waddin, thars no sayin what shifts the
                  army may be put too, or what artickle of female onderclothin may be next
                  reckwired.
               Every boddy here is on the look out for startlin bulletens from sum of the numerus
                  seats of war, but whether they'll cum or not is another kwestin. Thars ben so
                  menny disappintments that it isent wuth wile to flap wuns wings in advance.
                  Ankshus to crow and waitin impayshently for a chanst, I remain, rayther onder the
                  wether

                  WASHINGTON, February 7, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               In the present condishin of the "sakrid sile" it would be onpossabul for the grand
                  army of the Potomac (altho composed of patryits as would stick at nuthin in thar
                  kentry's caws) to take the field at enny pint without bein immediently stuck. It
                  would be eesier, in fack, for a collume of young mush-rats to make railroad time
                  throo sugar-house merlasses, than for our troops to accomplash a forrard movement
                  in the eggsistin state of these mushy diggins. Doorin the past week Ive ben acrost
                  the river takin soundins in the butiful shampain kentry around Alexandry, and I
                  ken oney say, that ef the peeple was hafe as yieldin as the sile the contest
                  atween Sam and Secesh would be a saft match and sun eended. Merryland, now, bein
                  of a sandy nater, issent near as deep in the mud as the Old Dominyun is in the
                  mire. Frinstance in Prence George I found a solid bottom eighteen inches down,
                  while in Ann Arundel, on the opposite side of the river, I could barly reach it
                  with a four foot pole. It seems therefore, as a Clay State, like Virginny, offers
                  more obstruckshins to an attact on the rebels than rejins with more grit and less
                  tenassty. Its my blefe that ef that slushy miry commonwelth was sot up eendways in
                  the sun to dreen, from now ontil the fust of April, you'd find jest as menny
                  leeches and suckers inter it as at present. I calkilate, howsever, the rodes wont
                  be more'n ankel deep in May. Ef thats the case and thars enuff left alive of
                  Camerun's teams and chargers to snake the guns along and mount a few dragons, I
                  shouldent be mutch disappinted ef a Quickshotish eggspedishin was to start
                  sekritly for sum place onknown to enny boddy but the guverment and the enemee.
                  Guvner Letcher, when on a drunk in Richmound tuther day, is sed to have bosted
                  that he got informashin of all our milentary plans weeks in advance of the New
                  York papers, and I predicate wot he sed was the naked truth onembellisht by
                     delirum trimmings.
               
               A sartain porshun of the Union men here—I meen the horseflesh hounds, shoddy
                  swindlers, beef banilitty, riful raskils, provishin pirits, blankit belzebubs and
                  the gallus birds of that fether—thinks June would be full airly for the army to
                  perpair for a march. Washington dident leave Volley Forge tell June, they say.
                  Wall he dident; but then he bed ony leven thousand hafe starved, barfoot sogers
                  (warn't they clar grit tho?), to fight Clinton und Niphosen with twenty thousand
                  vetrans as hed ben fattenin like turkey gobblers in a pen, at Philadelfy all
                  winter and spring, expectin what the French call a grand coo
                     domain in the airly summer. Taint so with our Potomac army. The
                  starvashin and the bar feet is all on tuther side, and we outcount the traitors
                  more'n three to two. Besides Washington could afford to wait for the waggin, seein
                  as Gates lied flaxt out Burgoyne and tuck six thousand prisners the prevus fall.
                     We haint performt no setch eggsplites, hev we? I gess wen the
                  Father of his Kentry was wanted, he was allus thar. Dident he cross the Delawar
                  Crissmass night, 1775, and lick the Heshins, at Trenton, and then turn round and
                  smash the British at Princeton two days arter New Years? I dont want to swar, but
                  I wisht I may never live to see Floyd hanged—and thats an orful wish for a troo
                  patryit—ef I dont mount the nex guverment contractor as venturs to cumpar the
                  sojerin on the Potomac with the conduck of the old war onder Ginral Washington, in
                  my hearin.
               Report ses as the poor sojers placed horse de combat (as the
                  Parishiners hes it) in the horspittle at Alexandry is onmarsfully treted. It is
                  sed thar vitals is bad and not enuff to fill thar bellies, and that they air kept
                  in dirty onventilated rums, with no proper medakill keer, nor medasin, nor nussin.
                  It is onderstood that the ded boddies of the deceased, and in coarse they air
                  numerous onder setch a sistem of die it and regiment, is pitcht promiscuss inter
                  pits, ennywars whar the grounds eesy to dig and shuvels is handy; and when fathers
                  and muthers, and wives and sisters, cum to ax for the remains of the dear wuns as
                  they gin up with sore harts to thar kentry's sarvice, noboddy nose whar the
                  boddies air, and the oney privelege they hev is to open the pits and take thar
                  chice. Congress has tuck up the matter it seems, and ef the tale's troo, as Ime
                  purty shoor it is, I oney wisht thar was a San Fransisky Vigilent Committy here,
                  to tuck up the gilty parties.
               I hop you hev got a copy of the report of the Van Wyck Cormmitty on the stealins
                  of the Guverment agents. It forms a page of criminil history that doosent cumpar
                  faverably with the Newgate calender. When the Recordin Angil transkribes the
                  dockyment, I persoom he'll put sum of the names in big capitals, and when the
                  individyals distingwished in this way gets on "tuther side of Jordan," its not
                  onprobabul as they'll find out why he dun it.
               
               The furrin dispatches to the Guverment by the last 'rival was all right I larn. A
                  report was currant yestday that Lord Pamerstun hed rit to Mr. Seward that he
                  should be mutch pleased ef we wouldent leave wun 'stun upon anuther in Charlestun.
                  It seems, howsever, that on luckin at the dispatch a seckind time it was notist as
                  the wurd "harbor" follered the wurd "Charlestun,"
                  witch makes a slite diffrence in the meanin. Setch mistakes is onvoidable. They
                  occur evry day in the hurry of bizness.
               Ginral Lane's "separit command" still hangs by the ilids. Opinyuns differs as to
                  the nater of the powers conferd enter him, but it is unannymously agreed that
                  Ginral Hunter hes made an everlastin Jewdy of hisself. Ef he is raaly ankshus to
                  sarve his kentry (and I spose he is), he hed better resine his commishin. The
                  actil reason why Qinral Lane is forbidden to go it alone, peers to be an idee that
                  he mought hurt the rebels.
               Yestday was a Bright day in the Sennit. Evry honest Union man in the land will
                  rejice that the Indiana traitor has got his desarts. I hope Villaindigham wont be
                  long arter him.
               You'll probly hev noose from Burnside and from Grant afore this goes inter type.
                  Trustin itul be of a nater to raise the sperits of the peeple and lower the
                  discount on Treshury notes, I remain, on the ankshus bench,

                     nitrous oxide on the old militaire. He writes in high spirits, and if there are
                     any extravagances in his letter that seem unbecoming the gravity of age, our
                     readers—who are all in ecstasies over the Union victories of the past ten

                  WASHINGTON, February 14, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The patryotic hellabloo in this city is tremenjus. We air all in the Seventh
                  Heaven, and the salvashin of the Union is konsidered sartain. The oldest
                  inhabitant, a venabul Aunty Diluvian as know Joyce Heth in her infancy, ses he
                  never seen setch rejiceins. Not a seesesher is to be found anywhars to-day. I
                  don't bleve Diagnosis with his lantern could diskiver a symtum of wun. They hev
                  suddenly changed thar colors like the cornelian. The feat of Burnside is in all
                  mouths, and the fact that Foote is in the enemy's rear asshoors us that rebellyun
                  will soon be kicked out of Tennessee and Kaintucky.
               The tall and talented Abe goes setch lenths in his hilarity that he seems like a
                  high old boy beside hisself. From the time the late bulletens of victry began to
                  drap in, he hes gon outer wun cannondrum fit inter another, without enny let up or
                  intermishin, throwin menny of his best frends inter convulshins. Nun of the
                  Cabbynet ken resist his joaks but Stanton, whoos mind is too strong and cam to be
                  disturbed by ennyboddy's humor. As to Welles, ef the President oney casts his
                  farseeshus eye onto him, and makes a correspondin jester, his sides begins to
                  shake and kwiver, like a Morgan hulk in a topsail breeze.
               In coarse the vivashus readers of the SUNDAY MERKARY will hev no
                  objeckshin to jine in the eggsploshin of larfter witch agitates the Deestrick
                  whenever the Momus of the White House fires off his 11-inch rib-ticklers. Wall,
                  onderneath I send you a small assortment, thrown right and left within the last
                  forty-eight hours, sum of witch is onderstood to hev creatid ginral devastashin
                  among buttons, suspenders, ladies cursit laces and cetery, in this city and
                  subbubs. To releeve the publick mind from narvous anksiety, and prevent the public
                  from stayin awake nights gessin at the truth, I send the offishal anser to each,
                  so that the greenest gander may see throo em; and ef I am not mistaken they will
                  be red by evryboddy with considabul goostoe. I forrard em as I am told they was
                  tuck down from the distingwished orther's lips by two littery slebrities who air
                  about to publish a lively vollum, wonder the titul of "The Rail-Splitter's
                  Railleries, or Wedges of Wit from the White House at Washington." These gentlemen
                  take it ride and tie, as the sayin is, wun or tuther of em bein constantly in
                  attendance, so that nuthin sourcastic as falls from the American Juvenile may be
                  lost to posteriority. I larn as the satyrs they hev already collected takes the
                  shine out of Wood's Minstrels. The book will be excloosively dedicated to Jock
                  Hilarity, and sooprior as a humorous more so to Joe Miller. But I beg
                  pardin for detainin you from the cannondrums and cetery. Here they be as they was
                  gin to me, with the kinder demonstrashins adapted to each.
               What is the difference between a park of artillery and the crust of a custard
                  pudding?
               
               One batters in the walls, the other walls in the batter. (Piano
                  snigger.)
               Why is Stanton like the youthful David?
               Because he has slung a Stone to the right spot, and struck terror into the
                  Philistines. (Laughter fortissimo accompanied by
                  clapping of hands.)
               What cannon have the most magical effect on the enemy?
               Weird Guns. (A pianissimo smirk.)
               What are the title and arms of the Suthern Barron at present in Mudsill custody in
                  Boston Harbor?
               He is Barren of Hope, and his arms can't be seen on account of the bar
                     sinister. (An inward smile à la
                  Leatherstocking.) The point opposite Point Comfort.
               The point of the bayonet (a moderate grin).
               Wise's favorite Latin quotation when referring to himself?
               
                  Sic-passim. It is to be feared our troops did
                     pass him while sick on their way to Elizabeth City.
                  (A slight twinkle of the weather eye.)
               What is the most extensive "forward movement" yet reported?
               An advance of one Foote up the Tennessee River. (He! he! he!)
               A contradictory coincidence.
               The same telegram that states the Richmond Blues were destroyed at Roanoke,
                  asserts that the rebels have got the blues at Richmond. (Ha! ha!)
               Worse than the Roman Corruptionists.
               Our "Cataline" Cabal. (Oh! oh!)
               Is Grant going on conquering and to conquer à-la-Napoleon?"
               No; he is only going to conquer A-la-bama. (Ah! bah!)
               Why is a U. S. Storeship like a treasury note?
               Because it's a Government tender. (O! la!)
               What style of ancient minstrelsy does the whiz of a rifle bullet resemble?
               Minnie-singing. (Only persons who have read Froissart expected to giggle.)
               Why did the rebels fire one side of Elizabeth City?
               They wanted to show what they could do in the burn side
                  way. (Ho! ho! ho!—slow!)
               You air to onderstand, eddyturs, as I dident hear the abuv myself, and I wouldent
                  swar to em enny more'n I would to the jottins and pencillins of N. P. W. or enny
                  other man, but ef poplar opinymu is wuth ennything, I ken oney say they air kwoted
                  as reglar Lincoln callembores by all the Pennselvany Avenoodles. Ef they air sham
                  Abrahams, they air so well calkilated to deceive that the best
                  counterfeit-joke-detector in the univarse might take them for genuine A. L.'s. By
                  the way talkin of cannondrums, here's wun as was sent on from Kaintucky by a sojer
                  who hed three brothers killed at the battle of Somerset.
               What dance was utterly forgotten at Mrs. Lincoln's sorry
                     dansente?
               Answer. The Dance of Death!
               Solem, isent it, and too troo. Peers to me the caperin at that ball was eenamost
                  like polkin over new made graves.
               My opinyun is that thars goin to be setch an openen up of intreeg and tretchery
                  afore long as'll astonish the nashin. Ginral Stone's case is a mild wun in
                  cumparisun to sum that will be heern tell of in the civil service, onless the
                  truth is choked down.
               I keep my eyes skinned and my ears opin, and whenever it is safe to tork right out
                  in meetin, expect full particklers from

                     rebellion broken and its strength utterly paralyzed. Perhaps he is right; but

                  WASHINGTON, February 21, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkcary:
               
               The Suthern cornfedracy as was so hungry for a fight a spell ago peers to hev got
                  a bellyfull allreddy. We air puttin em throo the mill purty rapid, I predicate. It
                  is reported here that when Cobb heerd of Fort Donelson bein shelled he
                  acknowledged the corn, while Toombs lucking as grave as a sexton, sed he was
                  prepard to berry the hatchet. Even the fire-eatin South Caroliny Shiverally—menny
                  of hoom is redooced to thar last spur and shirt collar—admits that the prospeck
                  ahed is rayther chillin.
               It must, in course, be aperient to evry boddy that the evacuashin shin of Missoori, Kaintucky, and Tennessee, is a
                  foregon conclooshin, and that Eastern Virginny will sun be relieved by a rear and
                  flank movement. Setch is the beginnin of the eend of our intestin
                  differculties!
               I bleve the rank and file of the rebel army would gladly file outer thar own ranks
                  inter ourn. By resortin to arms they hev reaped nuthin but shame and ruin, and now
                  it is sed they want to stack em and quit the field. Solomon ses that in his day
                  you couldent nock the foolishness outer a fool with a mortar; but prehaps the
                  mortars in Jerooslum warnt thirteen inchers and dident carry two hunderd pound
                  balls.
               It is whisperd around in pollytickle sirkils to-day, that the President is goin to
                  issoo a proclamashin grantin a ginral amnasty to all the sporters of the rebel
                  dienasty, as chooses to wash thar hands of that dirty consarn and begin the world
                  anoo with a clean record. The manyfesto is intended for the multitood, not for the
                  ringleaders as rung em in.
               The guvernment doosent intend to be niggerdly in its mercy to enny but the
                  nigger-drivin aristocrazy as sot the ball of Rebellion in moshin. With all the
                  rest it is willin to smoke the calamus.
               To-morrow bein the Berth-day of the Father of his Kentry, the hull city is to be
                  striped and starred. The troops is to hev extree rashins. A nayshinal saloot is
                  ordered at the Navy Yard and it is calkilated that not less'n a thousand
                  speciments of the Star Spangled will kiss the breeze. Watts-his-name, the gardiner
                  at the White House—him as prigged pairt of the President's messidge for the New
                  York Herald—is getherin fresh laurels to-day, to twine round the trofiz resently
                  sent from Roanoke Iland. At ight thar will be an illoominashin on a skale worthy
                  of the capital of an enlightened kentry, and ef enny disloyalist should decline to
                  light up on ackount of thinken the game not worth the candle, he will be likely to
                  git his winders smasht for his panes.
               About the time we air listenin to Washington's Farewell Address, onder the folds
                  of the federal flag here, Jeff Davis will be deliverin his interductory
                     cunard onder the rebel rag at Richmound. Wot will the
                  God-forsakin critter hev to say for hisself, I wunder? I persoom his speech will
                  be a jewel of the fust water—a perfeck bougie as the French
                  eggspress it. As he is reported to be the cheef eddytur and wire-puller of the
                  Richmound Inkwirer, I dessay the following parrygraft witch I sisserd from
                  Monday's edishin of that interestin and relieabul prent, givs a purty good ginral
                  idee of the stile and substance of his inaugerole:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "SPLENDID VICTORY AT FORT DONELSON.
                           "This splendid feat of arms and glorious victory to our cause will
                              send a thrill of joy over the whole Confederacy! It comes at the right
                              place and at the right time! All honor to the brave officers and
                              soldiers who have shed such lustre upon our arms, and added such
                              prestige to our flag! We shall delight to publish the full details
                              when they shall reach us. What further we are to expect on the same
                              ground we know not. * * *
                           "We trust that the stand so brilliantly commenced we shall be able to
                              make permanent, and to roll back the tide of invasion."
                        
                     
                  
               
               Possably Floyd, the cannon-cribbin coward, and Ginral Giddyun Whitefether Pillow,
                  may reach the traitor capital by tomorrow with the "full details". Ef so they will
                  sartainly arrive at the "right place and at the right time", and ef the noose
                  doosent send a "thrill over the hull cornfedracy", thars no thrill to it.
               The rebel simperthisers here is in'despare, with the eggsepshin of Mrs. Greenhow,
                  who bares evrything like a man. Menny of the leadin seecesh funkshinaries is in an
                  offal funk. Stephens, the rebel vice, feels very bad. Wise, it is sed, hes becum a
                  nidiot, and fancies the goste of John Brown is continally glidin arter him with a
                  slip-not in its skellinton hands. Twiggs is ankshus to put out. Gustarvus Smith
                  would be willin to sweep the streets of New York gratis to escape the besom of
                  destruckshin. Letcher weeps over his red-eye. Benjamin thinks he hes made a mess
                  of it. The Guvner of Georgy allows he is dun Brown; and Jeff would no dout be off
                  in a jeffy ef the feeld was clar, and he hed a good chanst to run. Indeed, all the
                  head rebels sees wot is hangin over em, and would be very glad to stand from under
                  ef they could.
               Trustin that they hev purty near reached the eend of thar tether, and will soon be
                  in a tight place, I remain, hopefully,

                  WASHINGTON, February 28, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               In compliance with your rekwest, onder date of February 18, I sent an accomplisht
                  and relieabul spy to Richmound to make keerful manyrandoms of Jeff Davises
                  inaugurashin. He hes jest returnt, and represents the speckticle as moanful in the
                  extreem. Menny sobbed aloud. The President tuck the oath as ef it led ben a doste
                  of ruebub or salts and sinner. The hull affair, the spy ses, reminded him of an
                  eegsecushin he wunst seen on Gibbet Iland in New York Bay, of a pirit by the name
                  of Hix. The platform, he allows, was percisely like the scaffold used on that
                  occashin, and nuthin was wantin but the ropes and the waits to komplete the
                  allushin.
               Jeff Davis was preseeded and follered by sevrall gentlemen in black, that bed evry
                  aperience of a sheriff's percesshin, and when the two as sported him on each side
                  let go thar holt, he cum forrard jest as Hix dun to make his dyin speetch, oney
                  luckin mutch more brokin down and desperated. The resemblants was so perfeck, that
                  the spy ses he started in sirprize when he seen Jeff s arms warn't pinioned, and
                  when the speetch was dun, he couldent help luckin around for the feller with the
                  white nightcap to dror over the culprit's visedge. It seems that jest as the
                  onfortnit critter bed got off his last sentence, a messendger rusht throo the
                  crowd and sunk allmost faintin on the platform. My informent declars he was so
                  full of the idee of an eggsecushin, that he couldent help hollerin "he's saved!
                  he's saved" " a repreve! a repreve!" But it warn't a reprieve. Contrarywise, it
                  was the noose of the ockipashin of Gnashville by the fedral forces, in the teeth
                  of all oppersishin. When Jeff heerd it, he kullapsed with a grone inter the cheer
                  behint him, and the surroundin multitood gin a despairin yell. The crowd of
                  moaners then disbursed in sairtch of steamalus, and the leadin funkshinaries stole
                  off like a theef in the night or a morording bed bug when he smells daylight.
               The maskline traitors here hes concluded to play the hypocrit senst the rebellyun
                  was skwelched in Tennessee, but the femmenines, as I menshund in my last, is as
                  savedge as ever. They oney regret that the flower of the South hev to bolt from a
                  passel of Northern mekanicks. A lady from Georgy told me tuther day she onderstood
                  that jurneymen blacksmiths and setch formed the princepull porshin of the Northern
                  files. I told her yes, and them was the kinder files we spiked the Suthern guns
                  with, witch rayther shet her up. Anuther she Seeesh remarkt to Seward that she was
                  sorry the gentlemen of the South had to contend with shoemakers and taylors; to
                  witch the galliant seckatry replide, in his onpretendin way, that it must be very
                  tryin to the shiverally to be whipt by setch degraded beins outer thar boots and
                  britches, at witch she gin her hoop a venamus sling and mizzeld.
               I spose the censureship of the tellagraft will be oney tempory; but in case it
                  shouldent, I am organizin a flock of carryer pidgins. I keep em in a coop in my
                  rum at Willard's, and ef a coo de tar occurs, you may expeck to
                  find wun a peckin at your winders, with the noose tied to his neck, in two hours
                  thararter. In coarse you won't publish the flyin rummers I may send, on ackount of
                  the standin order—but you ken bet your pile on em, and operate in the fancies to
                  advantage.
               Corjally hopin and belevin that a forrard movement is in progress that will nock
                  treson eendways, I remane, with a hart palpitatin with patryotic emoshins,

                     frame of mind when he sat down to indite the following letter. The

                     incline to believe that his views, though expressed in homely language, tally

                  WASHINGTON, March 7, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Ken ennything be more rilin to the curryspondent of a live jernil than to be full
                  up to the neck of the most eggsitin matter and onable to spit it out for the
                  bennyfit of an impayshent publick? Wal, setch is my all-aggravaitin predickymant
                  at present, and altho I hev a fair share of cheek for an old sojer, Ime obligated to keep my mouth shet,
                  notwithstandin my desire to make a clean brest of it. A stain upon my honor would
                  play the juce with me as a contribitor to the press; consekently the advices I
                  send you in cypher, for your own privit use, I advise you to keep dark, however
                  mutch your readers may sigh for supprest intellagents. Stanton gin me the facts in
                  a faint whisper, onder a pledge of privacy, when I dropt in at the War offiz
                  yesterday, and tharfore tho I forrard it to you, it must go no further. He ses the
                  crysis demands silence, and that the publickashin of the Guvernment's sekrits
                  can't be aloud.
               Howsever, tho orthentic dispatches is withheld, you hev a perfeck right to publish
                  all the conflictin rummers in sirkilashin—no gag law for the human imadjinashin
                  heving yet been issood by the Administrashin. In the absence of the offishal
                  trooth I hope the follerin reports, which is drivin the coolest and most
                  flagmatick citysins of the Deestrick to the verge of loonacy, will be satisfactry
                  to your reflectin readers. It is bruted abroad to-day that Memphiz has ben gin to
                  the flames—John Minor Botts blowed from the mouth of a canon—and Gnashville
                  attacted by the rebels tooth and nail. That the Union elefant is on
                     root for Tuskalooser (Allabam); that Jeff Davis hes ben assassnated,
                  with severell more of the same stripe; that Guvner Letcher was shot in the neck on
                  Sunday, in consekens of his intemperit percedens (witch is ginally bleved); that
                  our troops air approachin New Orleans by the shell road; that Floyd hes becum a
                  moneymaniac and Pillow turned soft; that John Brown's goste appeered to Ginral
                  Banks as he was marching on to Charlestown; that Guvner Pickens hes ben hung on a
                  palmetto tree; that W. H. Russell hes jined wun of the outlying devishins of the
                  rebel army; that Savannah is gettin hail columbiad; that the Mobile peeple are on
                  the moove for the interior; and that William Lied Garrison, desguysed as a
                  chattel, is at the head of an ebony conspurracy in Louseanna, with plenty of the
                  yaller boys in his pocket to cany it out.
               Famishin for facks as we air onder the guverment embargo, it is plesant to hev a
                  large assortment of flyin reports to seleck from. We air an ingenuous manufactring
                  peeple, and when the trooth is supprest by the supreme orthority, the market for
                  that artickle is purty sure to be sublied with setch substitoots as air gin abuv.
                  As long as the Censers hes thar swing over the press, the publick is sartain to be
                  led off on false scents. Sum may smell a rat and refuse to fowler em, but the
                  majority when deprived of informashin from more relieabul soarces, is oney too
                  reddy to swaller the most horrebul catstrophies invented by the dredful axident
                  makers. It is consolin to think, howsever, that our Suthern brethren will have the
                  trooth and the hull trooth, while we air denied it. They git it as
                  ushil, by the shortest cut from Washington; acrost the Potomac. We never hev hed
                  enny consealments from them, and never shell hev as long as dubblefaced traitors
                  in the Sennit and the House, and men well known to be hand and gluv with Secesh
                  Jessybells and Delielies, is permitted to hold responsabul offizzes.
               How do you like the messidge of the President proposin to bribe the Sutherners to
                  manspate that brethren of the cullerd perswashin? Peers to me that when an evil's
                  jest as shoor to die a nateral deth, as Floyd is to git his goose cooked tuther
                  side of Jordon, its hardly wuth while to pay a bonus for its eggstinkshin. The
                  yoke's eennamost broken now. Ef the South hed hollered, and sued for peace, why
                  then indeed it mought be all right to make setch a tender, but onder present
                  suckemstances its rayther tuff. Ime opposed for wun, to enny consillytory meshers,
                  ontil she caves in and cries copavi. Why should we offer to pay her to free her
                  slaves, when they air bound to free tharselves gratis for nuthin ef the war
                  continnees two years longer. Let the South back squar down, and then it will be
                  time enuff to be magnannymus; but as the case stands at present, millyuns for
                  war—not a cent for triboot, is my motto. Badly as the North's ben treted, Ime not
                  agen dooin the hansum thing if the offender repents, and eats humble pie—but as to
                  tryin to bribe armed traitors, it seems to me about okwiverlent to
                  offerin a premium to pirits to sirrindir thar prisners and thar plunder, when
                  youve got em foul and they hev no chice atween hauling down thar infarnal flag and
                  bein blown to blazes.
               No dout the President writ the messidge with the best intenshins; but it's an
                  orful foe paw, as the French say, and Ime afeard the enemee'll
                  make a handle of it. It is imminently calkilated to raise the droopin sperrits of
                  the rebel leaders, and ef they don't make capital outer it at Richmound, theyre
                  greener'n grass-hoppers.
               The mean way the Committee on Ways and Means picht inter the noosepaper interest
                  in thar tax bill, is univarsally condemd here. Oney think of saddlin the Pallajum
                  of our Libties with four distink taxes. Why its a step backards tords barberism
                  that's enuff to make the har of the civilised world stand on eend! Besides its
                  setch a parshil, spiteful meshur. Ef noledge is to be taxt, why not inclood public
                  skools, collidges, univarsities, privit
                  seminerries, the Smithsonian Instytoot, and all uther consarns for the 'fushin of
                  useful informatshin, as well's that grate poplar teacher, the cheap noosepaper. I
                  kant bleve that setch an attemp, to brake down the independent press will ever be
                  sankshund by Congress. Hopin that the vile projeck may git a lofty fall, and that
                  whoseumdever sports it may be a target for Eddytorial rath tell the day he dies,
                  and be tormented by printer's devils when he gets to that burn from which no
                  travler returns, I remain, disgustedly,

                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Cumming events cast thar shedders afore. The grand haul of the milentary seine
                  witch is to ketch the big Devil-fish of Rebellion, is goin briskly on, and ef the
                  strands doosent brake sumwhars, we shall sun see the commencement de la
                     fin as the French hes it. Accordin to the drorings of, the strutigy
                  net in the noosepapers, the skaly wretches hesent a loop-hole to riggle out at,
                  but droring the net of strutigy is sumthin like lottery droring,
                     nuty onsartin. The Burnsidle corner of the cool de
                     sack peers to be rayther week, witch is sartainly onfortnit, and
                  menny thinks as the army that moseyed outer Manasses may make a gap in our lines
                  at that pint. But I bleve Burnside, with the assistants of hot shot from the gun
                  boats will be able to nock 'em cold ef they try it on.
               In coarse you hev seen the announcement of the divishins in the Union army and
                  that Ginral Maclellin is at the hed of em. I jined his numerus milentary famaly by
                  speshil order, on the forth of March, and marched forth with my cumraids to glory
                  or the grave, singin the Hollerlooyer Corus, on Monday last. Prevus to startin,
                  the oath of seecressy bein tenderd me, I hed to swar. By the condtishins of the
                  bond, I am not aloud to breeth a wisper of wot is goin to happen, but arter it hes
                  tuck place I am at libty to spit it out. Ginralissimo Abe ses, the old
                  word-and-blow game is played out and that blows without words is to be the order
                  of the day herearter. Ef posteriorly doosent do jestis to that man I dont want to
                  go down to it. Evry boddy here lucks up to him. The Duc de, Chatters told me over
                  his soup the other day, that he considered him ekwuil to arshal Tureen or the
                  great Dook of Guys. In my opinyon he is a seckind Father of his Kentry and I dont
                  spose the son of Austerlitz, as the French is allas a crackin up, could hev held a
                  candle to him. Stanton is sum, and I like his summery way, but arter all the
                  President is a head and sholders abuv him in the esteamashin of peeple as
                  onderstands his meshurs.
               But a trooce to these desultry remarks into witch my warm friendship for the
                  President has betraid me. Wot I wanted to git at was this—that you mustn't relie
                  on me for enny informashin likely to proov prejewdishall to the plans of our
                  milentary Solomons.
               "Ef you was to let the cat outer the bag," ses little Mac to me yestday, in his
                  playful manner, "it mought, prevent us givin Jeff Davis rats." And that warnt all;
                  for he added In an ondertone, so as the uther staff fellers shouldent hear:
                     "Enter noose old boy, ef you do tell tales
                  outer skrool, Ile suspend you!"; and from a neckspressive moshin he made and his
                  emfasis on the word suspend, I considerd he ment more'n met the ear.
                  Ses I in response "Ginral my oath is sakrid;" at the same time tippin him the wink
                  to sho I new the ropes.
               On Toosday I made a tower of the enemees wurks at Manasses, by order of Ginral
                  Maclellin. My report—on forty pages foolscap—will I hope, prove acceptabul to the
                  Head of the army. I found the airthworkss at the Gap in pretty good condishin on
                  the hole, but the railroad was all tore to peaces at the Junkshin. Sines of hasty
                  evackuashin was visabul evrywhars. The rebels must have fled in great alarm. Wot a
                  pity we warnt privy to the moovement. I pickt up several intrestin speciments of
                  Suthern littery talent as was lying loose around. Amung uthers the follerin. Don't

                     Secretary Stanton's order, from sharing his knowledge with our readers. A great

                  HEAD KWARTERS IN THE FIELD, March 20, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               I spose youve hed wild rejisens in the North over the razin of the sege of
                  Washington. Arter bein infested by land and blockheaded by water for months by the
                  fo, we hev at lenth cut our way out, and the grand army and the fedral city may be
                  considerd, for the present, comparatively saift. Our march so far hes ben wun
                  unintrupted serious of cheerin tryumps; the enemee hevin plenty of locomotives to
                  carry em off and no motives wotever for stayin. The noose of our approach seems to
                  hev hed setch an effeck on thar sperits, that they immediently started by the
                  thousand at a time oen a train. Our Ginrals eggspected to find the rebel army well
                  disposed, and detarmined to defend thar
                  posishins, as Price's forces did theirn at Shugar Creek, to the bitter eend. But,
                  notwithstandin all thar blowins, they no sunner got wind of our sally than they
                  fled without a blow. In follerin em, howsever, it will be reckwizit to pei-ceed
                  with eggstream cawshin, for fear of runnin blindly inter that "last ditch" whar,
                  as the man in the play ses, they air resolved to "die nobly —die like demagogs."
                  The late galliant seckind in cummand at Fort Donalson, who onderstands all about
                  ditches, is bleved to hev gon South to dig it for em—arter witch he will
                  ondoubtedly dig out for sum saifter place of refudge. It may be considered sartin
                  that when the rebels sinks to rest on glory's bed they wont find a Pillow thar. In
                  fact, its more'n probabul that all the heads of the Rebellyun will turn up missin
                  at its tail eend.
               You will be glad to larn that I hev ben in a slight skrimmidge senst my last, and
                  cum out right side up as ushil. By permishin of the Ginral-in-cheef, me and the
                  County Paris, and the Dook de Chatters, went out on a skout with Ginral Stunman
                  tuther day, und a lively time we hed, killin menny and skarin more. Our force
                  consisted of about five hundred cavalry, and we met, or rayther we overtuck the
                  enemee, two thousand strong, near the Orange Railroad. "Go in lemons!" shouted the
                  Dook de Chatters, who is fast ackwirin a nolledge of the American tung onder the
                  tooterin of a New York Fire Zouwave. And at em we went, as fast as our
                  Camerun-contract coarsers would carry us. Thar hosses was fleet, but those of our
                  squadrun was fleeter. We pored down onto em like lava-indeed, I mought say, like
                  Balaklava. We should hev ben glad to charge em in front, but as they wouldent turn
                  round, to take em in the rare became a starn necessity. I was in advance of the
                  line, and went in, as I allus do, on my own hook. Rememberin my youthful explites
                  as a wild cattle-hunter in Texas, I put my reins in my mouth, and rushin my steed
                  inter thar flyin ranks, ketched two rebel bosses by the caudle eggstrematies, and
                  throwin the well-bred and doughseal animal I rode on his hanches, slung em both.
                  To dismount and present a brace of Colts at the heads of the fallen seeceshers was
                  the work of a seckind. They acknolledged thar discomforture when they seen the
                  perswaders, and signifide a desire to take the Oath of Fiedelity. Bindin em over
                  to keep the peace with thar own saddle-girts, I remounted my Cameronian charger,
                  and agin follerin the horsteal fo, repeted the slingin operashin. This I continued
                  for over an hour, when I returnt and pickt up my prisners—jest a duzzin—and druv
                  em inter camp. I hed eenamost forgot to state that I plugged a bushwhacker as was
                  drorin a bead onto my yung frend the Dook, and parrid a fatal cut aimed at my
                  brother-in-arms, the County Paris.
               Ginral Stunman would hev complimented me on my bravery in a speshil order of the
                  day, but as I prefered the SUNDAY MERKARY as a mejum of
                  commoonicashin with the public, he gracefully yielded the pint; bein the fust time
                  that brave man ever yeelded to ennything human. Of all dragon offsirs I ever seen
                  he's the trump. The Dook de Chatters was kind enuff to present me with a cupple of
                  Legin of Honors he happend to hev about him, and the County Paris gin me as a
                     quid pro quo for my sarvices a portrit of his
                  grandfather Loose Fillip—witch he sed was the very spit of him—butifully sot in
                  Californy dimonds of the finest water.
               Most of the time senst the buv-menshent brilyant feet, I hev ben, as the play ses,
                  "a looker-on in Vienna," or at least stayin in that naybrood with a detachment of
                  cavalry. Bivowhackin in the field is plesent, when thar isent too much bushwhackin
                  around. Offsirs that cotton to wun anuther sit by the campfires of an evenin, for
                  hours together, spinnin yarns. Thars wun curus story that's like Old Virginny—it
                  never tires. I have heerd menny a man tell a graffic tale, that hed no more trooth
                  inter it than a tellegraffic messidge; but this story is as true as hisstory:
               It seems that for sum munts past a misterus critter hes ben playin hob with the
                  rebel centries and pickets in the woods below Leesburg. Sumtimes they hev ben
                  found on thar posts shot in the neck and onable to make any response to the
                  inkwiry, "How cum you so?" More'n twenty, I onderstand, hev at diffrent times been
                  diskivered mortally wounded—and all too far gone in speechless aggerny to tell wot
                  hurt em. At least an ekwill number hes ben killed outright, and the rongdoor cant
                  be detected. Pinned to each victims brest is found a rood drorin of a bull on the
                  rampage, from witch our men infur that the assassin hed sum deer frend or relashin
                  slain at the Bull Run stampede, and takes this kwict method of accommodatin his
                  felines of revenge. A tall, spare figger, about the bild of our venabul President,
                  is ockashinally seen flittin throo the brush in the visinity of the seen of blud,
                  but all attemps to chase down the long-legged aparishin hes, so far, proved
                  bootless. The soopersdishus rebels spose the "Speckter Scout" (as the mistery is
                  called by our sojers), to be the goste of John Brown on the warpath, and they
                  allow that he will never rest in his grave tell he hes wiped out Guvner Wise. This idee seems to gain
                  confirmashin from the fact that the airly victims all belonged to the Wise Legin,
                  witch is sed to hev fallen back in order to git outer harms way.
               While the curryspondents of the New Yorkr papers is furbid to say a word about the
                  advance as is goin forrard, rebel spies huvers about our camps pickrin up
                  informashin from varuss kwarters—headkwnarters inclooded. Wun hafe of the peddlers
                  is nuthin better'n rebel jayhawkers in desguys, and the display of thar wars is
                  oney a peace of subterfudge, a reglar sell. Statshinary venders hev repeatedly
                  betrayed our moovements, and wunst, in consekens of a diskivery made by a
                  pretendted cookey-marchant, the Cummander-in-chief found his cake all dough.
                  Shockin to relate, tellers blastfeemusly passin tharselves off as parents of Bible
                  Sosities and setch, hes sumtimes gon throo the army distribitting the Sakrid
                  Vollum with a libral hand, for no uther purpus than to entrap Ithe onwary inter
                  revelashins. The defeet of several important plans has also ben traist to
                  coalporters as perfest to emmanate from the Youngs Men's Christian Assoshiashin.
                  Relidgin bein the weak side of most of our offsirs, menny hes ben suckt in by
                  these wulves in sheep's peltry. Amung the vile pack of spies, thar is likewise not
                  a few as deals in keards ; and as our sojers are as hot for poker as they air for
                  preachin, ef not more so, these ongodly sirkilators of the Devil's books hes hed
                  considabul sucksess in the Poll Pry line. This is the way the enemee gets inter
                  our sekrits, and not throo tellegraft dispatches to the noosepazpers, witch they
                  luck upon as little better'n invenshins of the wire-pullers.
               You never seen a jollier set of fellers than the offsirs hev ben senst we took the
                  feeld; and the Ginrals of divishin is onderstood to be now engaged in gettin up
                  sum surprise parties witch it is thort will be brillyant affairs. In fact, I
                  reckin wun of em munst be onder way at present, for I hear the cavalry bugles
                  soundin to boot and saddle. I must tharfake resign the pen for the swoord, and
                  remain, eger for the fray,

                  STRASBURG, March 28, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Ginral Maclellin is aciduously preparin to giv the rebellyun a fatal punch,
                  wotever the spoony agitators of the Triboon may say to the
                  contrary. Purty sun the hull kentry will sing Tedium, as the
                  French did at Not a Dam, arter the fight at Sulphurino, and over a
                  victry ekwilly gloryus. The Anny Condy is around! The deth skweedge is approachin!
                  In the meantime the Ginral, knowin that a negernness to carry the war inter
                  Afrikey hes ben frettin my gizzard ever senst the sege of Washington commenst,
                  kindly 'lows me to take a hand in the prelimindary skrimmedges. Consekently, in
                  the late pluckiy affares at Winchester and Strasburg I was fortnit enuff to pluck
                  a few lorils. The engagement on Sunday was wun of the hottest shindies that hes
                  tuck place doorin the war. No dout suin of your Sam-singin Sabbatarians will
                  consider we tuck an ongodly libty in fitin for the Union on the Lord's day. But
                  you kant ajurn a battle on ackount of Sunday, enny more'n you ken ajurn a soler
                  ecleps or the Vernil Equanlnocks. War doosent know enny setcth thing as a dies none. And so on Sunday, the day when setch divines as your
                  Revrend Doctor Hawks deklines to ax a blessin on our arms, we was "makin mob
                  howl," as the prophet I Sayer ses. I'm not an infiddle by no means, and though I
                  don't harp as mutch on relidjus subjecks as sum folks, I bleve in keepin the
                  Sabbath wholly; but an army, when attacted, must take its own part. Ef secesh will
                  consent to stack arms and go to meetin wun day in seven, so will Yankee Doodle;
                  but as the inspired Jerry Myer remarks (chapter 6, varse 14), wots the use of
                  "sayin Peace! Peace! when thar is no Peace." When thars no chice
                  atween fitin on a Sunday and bein nockt inter the middle of nex week, it stands to
                  resin that sojers must forego thar devoshins rayther'n becum a pray for the
                  unwriteous.
               But a trooce to digreshins. As youre awar, nuthin of moment occurd on the 22d
                  instant, eggsept that our gloryus Shield was so much injerd as to be onfit for
                  sarvice the follerin day. The hull army regretted the axdent, but, as the Scripter
                  ses, we relied on Providence as our "buckler and shoor defence," and went in on
                  Sunday mornin feline as confident of suckcess as Saint Gorge did when a saltin the
                  Fiery Dragon. The rebel ranks hed ben
                  sweld doorin the night by a new corpse five thousand strong, this fresh body bein
                  led by Ginral Garnet, consider by the secesh a milentary jewill of the fust water.
                  They thort the nolledge of Garnet's arrival would hev gint us a preshus stun, but
                  we hed heard aforehand that his men was a passel of misabul topers, and besides
                  our blud was up, and like Heenan, or Sayers, or the New York Common Counsell, we
                  was reddy for ennything in the ring. The rebels was headded by Ginral Jackson, who
                  doosent claim enny relashinship to the late Hero of New Orleens, tho Ime of
                  opinyun that his right to a descent from Old Hickry in a direct line—with a loop
                  at the eend out—kennot be disputed.
               The cumbat opend with a lively artillery dooill. Our round shot smashed thar
                  squaurs, and plowed throo thar collumes with harrowin effeck. Thar fire warnt
                  noways slack nuther, and as we hed both got our ranges, we raked wun nuther like
                  blazes. Purty sun thar right wing fainted, at the same time thar flyin artillery,
                  follerd by a large body of foot, pitched in over on the left. Then our bands
                  struck up and our playtoons advanced. It was a tremlenjus struggle. But at last we
                  druv em. Nex they tride to brake our center by an eshellon
                  moovement, but they got a shellin as soon convinced em it was a bad egg, and they
                  fell back at a Flora Temple trot. Then follerd a suckseshin oil attacts and
                  repulses till, about 4 P. M., when the eggsauasted fo findin wot a clock it was
                  with em began to giv way. Doorin this interval, sum of our offsirs and men
                  performed setch progenies of valor as is the nateral offspring of stout harts and
                  a wholly caws. Wun Suppleturn, of the Eighty-forth Pennsylvanly, acktilly jumped
                  up behint a Virginny major as he wheeled his hoss to retreat, aud ketchin the
                  rains with his left hand while he choked the rider with his right, brort him in,
                  black in the face, as a prisoner of war. I never seen a prettyer feet of arms. The
                  major blastfeemed orfully when he rekivered his breth, and sed it was a
                  sircuss-rider's trick and nuthin better. I hed several pursenal runcounters
                  myself, for whenever an extree charge was orderd, I tuck keer to be counted in. On
                  wun ockasshin a rebel kernil, armed to the teeth and carryin an Arkransas
                  toothpick as probly weighd nine pounds in his right hand, spurred his hoss at me,
                  and throwd his weepin with setch murderous force that it went throo my milentary
                  flap-jack and inter the mouth of a key-bugle forty paces in the rare, eenamost
                  sendin it dowh the trumpeter's throte. Ime not fond of blowin, but I wisht you'd a
                  seen the back stroke that kernil got in return. It sheered off his coconut as ef
                  his neck hed ben made of vegetabul marrow or mangle worseill, and the charger
                  dasht on with the raskilly carcuss upright in the saddle, jest as ef nether hoss
                  nor man was conshus of the cutastrophy, ontil the curus speckticle disappeared in
                  the smoke of battle.
               About hafe past 4 in the arternoon the pursute began, and of all actyve pursutes
                  that I was ever engaged in, that was the liveliest and most excitin. We druv em
                  inter Strasburg, and outer Strasburg, and ten miles beyant Strasburg, like straws
                  afore the worldwind. The milentary report ses: "Our artillery played continally on
                  the rebels." But ef that was playin, I wunnder wot Ginral Banks calls airnest?
                  Monday mornin the same orful, pastime was recommenst, ontil all thar survivin foot
                  sojers hed got inter the mountins, and the hoss was either taken or cut to
                  peaces.
               Ime so stiff in the jints yet with hard ridin that I aint by no means fit for
                  littery effort, and Ime afeard this letter isent in my ushil elastick vain. As sun
                  as I git soopeld out I shell rite agen, can in the meantime I remane, on the key
                  veeve for anuther skrimmidge,

                  WILLOW GROVE, NEAR WOODSTOCK, VIRGINNY, April 4, 1862.
               
               That porshin of the milentary reptyle onder the keer of Ginral Banks, snakes along
                  purty lively. Ef tthe tail and the rest of the boddy doos as well as the head, the
                  rebels now flyin like sheep every witch way, will be lammed at all pints and
                  finerly skwelched in its contracted folds. Toosday bein the fust of April, Kernil
                  Ashby, with his cavalry and sum infantry, sposed to be pairt of the Wise lejin,
                  hed the foolhardeeness to despute our march, but in coarse we was more'n a match
                  for em, drivin em eendways twelve milds and inter Woodstuck as ef Lucyfur was arter em. On Wensday, hevin shelled
                  the Kernil outer Woodstuck, and inter Edenburg sevin milds beyant, we stopt to
                  mend the bridges, burnt by this arch rebel and his incinderary follerers, and
                  to-morrer or nex day, so we hop, we shall be arter him agen on the rode to
                  Staunton. Ginral Jackson's mane boddy is probly saift for the present in the
                  hills, but his rare is in the bottom land, and we expect to cut it off. The gait
                  at witch these high minded, onsensabul-to-fear-fellers travels is a caushin to
                  Jack-the-Joint killer's sevin-legged boots. "Old Virginny never tire," the song
                  ses, and no more it doosent. Ef the secesh kant fight for the commonweal, they ken
                  run for it faster'n enny common wheel you ever seen, and air eenamost ekwill to
                  thar own locomotives. I've heern tell of the wunderful feets of Jackson, the
                  American Deer, but I'll bet horns round for a ridgement, he couldn't hev beat
                  Jackson, the American traitor, when he was on the full lope for Strasburg with
                  Kernil Tyler and the Third Brigade at his hanches. They tork like Spurtycuss in
                  the Gladiater, these Suthern leaders, but they aint wuth a darn at closte
                  kwarters. I onderstand that W. H. Russell, Hell, Hell, D.—as the cocknees calls
                  him—speaks, in his last letter to his owners in London, of the "onyieldin South."
                  Ef the Father of Fibs should ever go inter the travellin sircuss line, he oughter
                  to engage that farseeshus gentelman as clown to the infarnal ring; his grimaces in
                  black and white takes the shine out of all the odd tricks I ever seen played with
                  the papers, and I've ben a speshil curryspondent of the press for over twelve
                  years. "Onyieldin Sout!" But mebbe he means the cotton and terbacker fields, witch
                  sartinly is likely to be rather onyieldin for a seesin or two.
               The noose from Port Rile is plesent, isent it? The "onyieldin" rebels hes scudded
                  off from the Scudaway batteries, and bolted like thunder from Fort Thunderbolt.
                  The bellygerents at Fort Poolasky also wants to evackyate, but thars no passidge
                  open, and they'll hev to cave in. In the neybrood ot Bufort, North Caroliny, the
                  Last-ditchers is ekwilly ankshus to clar out, witch maybe eggspressed in a single
                  standsir as follers: 
                     
                        The cornered rebels in Fort Makin
                        Desires, in vain, to save thar bakin,
                        But bein man-and-God-forsakin,
                        Will by a salt be shortly takin;
                        For Goldsboro thar walls will break in,
                        While Burnside gives thar rare a rakin.
                        Oh! won't thar be a dry-bones shakin,
                        A reglar third-day ager kwakin,
                        When Yankee troops, for glory achin
                        Knock Smith to smithers in Fort Makin?
                     
                  
               
               It seems thars no feesabul way for the rebels to vamose from Fort Makin, eggsept
                  by way of Rogues Sound, and Ginral Burnside sposin they would instinktively take
                  that rout, hes headed em off at Morehead City, witch is jest oppersit. To use a
                  favorit Suthern frays theyre "dun gon in." Captin Smith who commands the
                  fortyficashin, is about as badly off as the coon that surrendered to his namesake,
                  and he'd better cum down afore the shootin begins ef he wants to save his peltry.
                  I scarsly think thar'll be mutch fushin of blud at Fort Makin, for Smith, as you
                  will gess from his name, belongs to wun of the numerus fust famalies in the South,
                  and probly wouldn't like to be wiped out by common Northern mudsills.
               Charlestoun it seems is an orful funk, and the civil funkshinaries at last
                  acknounts, was talkin of settin fire to the city, and runnin away by the light of
                  it—a favorit dodge in the "Onyieldin South." The wimmen and children was leavin,
                  and the men, notwithstandin thar wish to welkim the "Cowardly Yanks" "with bluddy
                  hands to horspitable graves," felt as ef it was their dooty to foller on and look
                  arter their famalies. The rebel giginral Evans recently marched from that
                  visinnity in sairtch of the invaders, and on finding em, immediently "retreated in
                  a masterly manner." The Onyielders is not introosive. Ef thars ennything for witch
                  they air remarkabul it is their retirin dispersshins, and thar
                  bashfulness in the presence of a Union crowd. Floyd, Pillow, Wise, Jackson,
                  Johnston, evryboddy in fack, as is ennyboddy, in Dixie, retires in a masterly
                  manner. Advancin backards is thar fort.
               Mebbe afore this gits inter prent thar'll be a grate fight in Virginny, and mebbe
                  thar wont. The moovments of the big army wurm as is to enwollop the rebels in its
                  coils, is ambigus. Sum thinks it is of the same genus as the sellybrated mareen
                  monster as visits Nayhaunt every summer and is conneckted with so menny tales.
                  Uthers calls it a chunk-hed and allows thars nuthin inter it, but my opinyun is
                  that the critter's of the Great Bore speshis, and will as sartainly swaller the
                  Rebellyun as the whale bolted Jonah or Barnum's snake the blanket. Ef it doosent
                  sumthin else will, so wots the odds?
               Hopin that the general lickin, witch, accorain to naturalists precedes the boltin
                  in setch cases, will sun take place, I remain, wurmily,

                  HEAD KWARTERS, NEAR YORKTOWN, VIRGNNY, April 9, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               In compliants with orders from head kwarters I cut my stick from Ginral Bankses
                  divishin at Stunny Crick on Friday last, for the porpus of jining Ginral
                  Maclellin's staff. My feller a decamps of the Fift Army Corpse,
                  showed the most lively emoshin at partin, and I mutt say I was considabully mooved
                  myself as I gallupped off. Ginral Banks was kind enuff to remark that he was sorry
                  to looze the sarvices of setch a distingwished old sojer, and presented me with a
                  pocket-pistil as a shootable tokin of a steam. Wun of my bruther offsirs gin me a
                  flask as a cumpaniun to the pistil, and I now ware em about my purson as a
                  mementor of the glorious sperits I left behind me in the Fift Divishin. Ginral
                  Maclellin receved me with mutch swervity and perliteness, returnin my respeckful
                  bow with the kwiet curtsy peculiar to that wunderful struttygist. I am afeard you
                  will regaird me as little better'n a bag of wind in makin wot may seem to be vane
                  pursenal illushins to myself, but I asshoor you I am not puft up in the leest by
                  the oner dun me, but continny jest as condesendin to my ekwils as ef I warn't made
                  mutch of. Atwixt ourselves, Eddyturs, I hev my douts whether I should be treted
                  with setch a grate attenshin, but for bein the curryspondenat of an influenshil
                  noosepaper. When a kernil gives me an oncommon hard squeedge of the hand, I put
                  down two-thirds of the presshur to the fack that I am a member of the press, and I
                  kant kelp thinkin as the little presents of segars and shampain sent so frekwently
                  to my kwarters lies more inter em than meets the eye. As a means of obtainin
                  promoshin, the pen, as you are awar, is sumtimes mityer'n the swoord. I could add
                  more on this interistin tropic, but it shall never be sed that D. V. violated the
                  confidence even of the confidence kernils as reposed thar ambishus hops in his
                  onabul buzzum. I would saty, howsever, throo your abel jernil—witch is kept on
                  file by milentary men of evry rank—that my sole spurns corrupshin, and that no
                  amount of hideseek and regelees will indoose me to reckymend fether-headed
                  boasters as proper persons to be made Bragadears. Incompetent offsirs as eggspecks
                  me to write em up, leans on a brokin read.
               But I am stragglin off from the matter in hand, witch is the proposed seeser of
                  Yorktown. The path of Glory lays open afore us, but the road is bad. Ever senst
                  the army left Cockletown the hevvy mud hes ben a severe trial to the mussels of
                  the men. On Toosday it rained pitchforks and blowed great guns, witch, in addishin
                  to the shells throne at us by the enemee, made the rout ennything but plesent. It
                  is difficult to wheel a collume whar the ruts is deep enuff for graves, and
                  eenamost onpossabul to wheel a gun-carridge, and in coarse with setch tremenjus
                  engines of war we frekwently broke a shaft. Ornary humans would hev considerd an
                  advance outer the kwestin, but this army consists prencepully of sooperhumans.
                  They dasht at dubble krwick throo onpentrable woods, and fairly danced acrost
                  bottomless moreasses. Ef a battery opened onter us we immediently shet it up.
                  Skrimidgin was frekwent on the march, but I hev herd of nuthin to the enemee's
                  advantidge. The press, as ushil, distinguished itself. I larn that on Sunday the
                  curryspondent of the New York World brort in three prisners, wun onder each arm
                  and wun on his back. Wot a corntrast to Russell's Bull Run from Centerveal.
               Hevin overcum all prelimlindary obstickles we air now encampt within two milds of
                  Yorktown, getting reddy to go in. But the works of the rebels is voloomninus. They
                  eggstend clear acrost the tung of land atwixt the mouths of York and James, and
                  sho setch a formadouble row of teeth that to attact em seems like rushin inter the
                  jaws of destruckshin. I menshin this fack that the publick may appreshiate the
                  eggsplite, when these impregnable fortyficashins is carried with the bagnet. The
                  rebel resarves behind the wurks is varusly estimated at from 15 thousand to 51
                  thousand vetruns. I dont know witch number is right, but Ile hev em counted ef
                  possbul when the place is tuck, and let you know.
               Balloon reckonnuisances is made frekwently. I went up yestday myself, as high as the highest mounting in
                  the neybrood, and obtaned important informashin, with I will send you arter the
                  sege is over, ef Seckatry Stanton doosent objeck. It kant, howsever, be a vilashin
                  of the 57th artickle to state, that with the assistants of a dubble-ackshin
                  paytent refractory tellescope, I brort Ginral Magruder so near that I could
                  eenamost hear him swar and could distinctly see him drink. He peered to be takin a
                  horn about the size of the wun as bloo down the walls of Jerryco. The offsirs
                  ginrally seemed to be engaged in similder ginastick eggsersizes. It was a butiful
                  Spring day, was yestday, and I hev seldum seen the swallers more numerus.
               Among the spiles taken this week was a curus dockyment found in the desarted
                  shanty of a rebel engineer offsir. It was a kompleat plan of Ginral Maclellin's
                  forrard moovement, and the date shode as Magruder hed all the particklers from A
                  to Izzerd, long afore the Nuthern press was awar that the grand army was going to
                  moove at all. I merely elude to this little incident en possum,
                  as the French say, as a strikin pruff of the saygassity displaid in institootin
                  the tellegraft censureship, in order to keep the enemee in the dark as to the
                  struttygems of the Commandin Ginral. Whoos the infarnal traitor as peeped over the
                  sholder of the Guverment?—that's the kwestin.
               Thars a rummer from the Roads as that tuff customer the Merrymac and sevin steam
                  tenders, is all reddy for anuther tug o. war, and I spose by the time this letter
                  reaches you the fight will hev ben fit and the victry wun. I trust the Monitor
                  will rip inter the old Turtle's iron sell; but ef she doosent, the Vanderbilt's
                  purty shure to run throo the infarnal cuss ef they let her rip. But wots the use
                  of speckerlatin when the issoo will prehaps be decided afore these lines cums to
                  hand; and not onprobably the enemees lines, witch I ken see stretchin for milds on
                  ether side as I set ritin in my tent, will be in our perseshin. Hopin we'll make
                  anuther Cornwallis of Magruder by nex week at the latest, and that when taken he
                  wont be too drunk to be amusin, I remain, antizzipating victry,

                  IN FRUNT OF YORKTOWN, April 14, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               To use a eunick and novil frays, much patternized by the tellagraft, evrything is
                  progressin favorbly. Sevral thousand conterbands is engaged to-day in draggin
                  artillry mules outer the moreasses; and ef the wether continnees fine, the hevvy
                  howitstirs as disapered in the kwogmires doorin our march will be razed by the
                  last of April. Hevin takin the precawshin to plant boys over the places whar the
                  guns went down, the men will no whar to dig for em, and tho even thar breeches has
                  gone under, I hev no dout they will all be brort to the sirfiz. Here in camp, the
                  mud is mostly half leg deep for light infantry, and sum of the German ridgements
                  is up to the seckind jint in the saft and plastic sile. The ground about Ginral
                  Maclellin's hed-kwarters presents the aperience of a cow-yard arter a three weeks'
                  steddy rain, and the waity members of his millentary fammaly now and then sticks
                  fast in the slow. Bein light and spry hisself, he manages to skip the bad places,
                  and so avides bein stuck. As a ginral thing, the upper-crust will support a small
                  drummer. A panick onder setch suckemstances would be onplesent, bekase it would be
                  onpossabul to run as fast as on terror firmer.
               Howsever, thars no danger of a panick. Not a man in this invinsabul army nose what
                  fear is well enuff to diskribe it without a dickshinary. We air all as jolly as ef
                  war was a plesent game at keards—tho we no not how sun the strongest harts amung
                  us may be played out and kivered with thar cumraids spades. As to the shufflin and
                  cuttin—we leave that to the "nateral heroes" of the Land of the Last Ditch. Wun of
                  our amusements (I elude to the offsirs) is to get the darkeys to dance for us wen
                  thar days wurk is dun. Thars a dry green spot about a pistil-shot from my tent,
                  whar a passel of us gethers evry plesent evenin to see our cukumber-legged frends
                  perform thar wunderful brake-downs, and with the help of a little "Crookshin lawn"
                  (old Mungoheeler whiskey) we manedge to hev a very lively feet
                     shampeter.
               
               The sojers is strickly forbidden to plunder; but ef fethers and brissels doosent
                  gro spontanusly in these swomps, Ime inklined to think, from aperiences, that
                  seecesh chickens and shoats is considabully cornfiscated in a privit way by
                  independent forridgin partees.
               It may be as the owls cro like roosters in this regin, and that the grunts I heer at night is the snorin of the
                  German hevy dragons, but I hev sartinly heerd the same noises whar thar was
                  hen-rusts and pig-pens.
               Balloon investigashins takes place daily, and a correck and relieable map of the
                  hull airy of the enemee's wurks hes ben tuck by wun of our errornots. The seecesh,
                  howsever, hes sot up a noppersishin, and sports neerly as big a bag of wind as we
                  do. They call it the Giddyun Pillow, arter the inflated bein of that name as
                  kullapsed at Fort Donelson. Yestday both consarns was up at wunst, and cum so
                  closte together that riful shots was eggschanged atween the civil engineers in the
                  baskets. It is thort that a bullet fired by wun of our topografical fellers
                  perpetrated the bottom of the rebel gas bag, but it retired in good order to the
                  frendly kiver of a nayborin cloud to hev the hole darned. The results of our
                  atmostfearical scoutin, so far, is rayther startlin. The fo is reported at wun
                  hunderd and fifty thousand strong, with six hunderd guns; but sum thinks the
                  trunks of the trees they air haulin from the woods to bild brestwurks was mistakin
                  for artillry. As the balloon estimit of the rebel force at Manasses was two
                  hunderd thousand men, with fortificashins ekwill to the Mollycoff and the Mammylon
                  at Seblastypull, and the actil number turnt out to be oney forty thousand, behint
                  sum misabul airthwurks, it is sposed by reflectin minds that errorstatic
                  observashins is allmity onsartin. Purfessor La Mounting ses that the
                  refractoriness of the upper atmostfear is amazin, and that when the obsarver is
                  elevated above a givin pint he is apt to see dubble. This skyentific vew of the
                  case hes ben adopted, I bleve, by Ginral Maclellin.
               Senst my last, I hev spent two plesent days with the advance, as a volunteer
                  sharp-shooter. I never tride the tellascupic sites afore, and I consider em a
                  grate conveenyance. At a kwarter of a mild they bring wun of the "nateral lords of
                  the sile" so neer that the ornaryest backwoodsman kant miss him. I laid in ambush
                  behint a chinkapin bush and plugged seventeen, takin keer, howsever, not to hit em
                  in the hed, or the stummick, or enny vital part; bekase as it takes four well men
                  to carry off a cripple, evry wownded man counts five outer the ranks, while a ded
                  feller, rekwirin no assistants, is left whar he draps, and oney counts one. The
                  most important strutegic manover in war is to knock a man over without killin him.
                  Frinstance, when thars twenty-five thousand of the enemee, ef you kin wownd five
                  thousand, it takes the uther twenty thousand to tote em away, by witch the feeld
                  is left vakint and they air totally defeeted. (See the Hull Art of War by the
                  Curryspondent of the Sinsinater Times.)
               Torkin of the press, the riters for that omnippertent institooshin is kiverin
                  tharselves with glory on this peninslur. Ime proud of the frayternity. Pen in
                  hand, they persoo thar inkwiries evrywhars. The curryspondent of the New York
                  Times hed a fence rall shot onder him last week, while settin onto it galliantly
                  takin notes of an affair of outposts. Anuther distingwished jurneyman jurnilist
                  was chaste three furlongs acrost an open by a reckoshettin ball, and saved his
                  life by fallin inter a gully jest as it hopt over. The world would hev regretted
                  his loss, ef the missill hed put him throo. The artists for the pictoryals is also
                  cool and cam in the midst of the most eminent dangers, and wun of em cum very neer
                  bein rubbed out yestday while making a sketch of sum skedaddlin rebels. A shell
                  fell inter his hat, witch he hed takin off for coolness, but fortnitly, like menny
                  others, it hed no fews.
               The plans of Ginral Maclellin for usin up the shiverally at Yorktown air the most
                  masterly that hes ever ben corntrived senst Siezir crost the Rubigun. Setch, I
                  larn from a desarter, is the opinyun of Ginral Jo Jonstun, the rebel cummander,
                  who hes hed em by him ever senst the middle of March. In coarse I am not aloud to
                  whisper wot they air, but all the particklers is in the Norfolk and Richmound
                  papers; Seckatry Stanton's standin order for the promoshin of lyal ignorance not
                  bein respected by thar sassy eddyturs.
               It is reported here that the Merrymac bust a gun when she was out in the Roads
                  tuther day, and that but for the magnannymus detarminashin of the Seckatry of the
                  Navy to take no advantides of a genrus fo, she mought hev ben nockt eendways.
                  Seckatry Welles is the right man in the right place. Dont you think so? I dont, by
                  thunder!

                  [Hampered by the Star Chamber edict of the War Department, our old
                     correspondent writes this week with less than his usual vim. It is easy to see
                     that he pines under the restraint
                     imposed upon him by the Senseless Censorship of the Press.—EDs.]
               
               
                  ADVANCE GAURD, YORKTOWN PENINSLUR, April 23, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Senst I rit last things hes gon on in the ushil rootin stile; but as the rains hes
                  ceast and the sakirid sile is no longer an infernal dam, its not onprobabul that
                  the stormin will sun commense. Our boys, as you may conjecter is egur to take the
                  shine outer the blasted Seecesh, and ef they cut up ruff they'll git polisht off
                  in short order.
               Sum thinks, howsever, that as the uther collumes of our army drors to a foecus on
                  thar flank and rare, the cornfedrits seein no outlet from the intrickit maize,
                  will acknollidge the corn as Cornwallis did, without waitin to be shelled out.
                  Cobb, I onderstand, is in a desput way at the prospect, and a kernil as was tuck
                  prisner this mornin ses he would give his ears to be outer the scrape. He hes no
                  confidence in the resent raw re-enforcements standin fire.
               But my own idee is, that a bluddy struggel is brewin. The rebellyun is a hopless
                  case, but they'll fight it out to the bitter eend. Ef our gunboats could git up
                  the James, we'd put em throo thar jimnastics purty kwick. They'd find it ratyther
                  a hard row to hoe to hold thar present persishin onder a rakin fire from that
                  kwarter. But the Merrymac is coder of the walk, and bein aloud to crowt it over
                  everything we hev in the Roads, thars no chanst for our turkles to run up inter
                  the inteeryur and help us carry Yorkrtown by a coo de main. Our
                  fleet hed the monster fowl tuther day, with its big gun busted and its beak in the
                  mud, but the orders was not to attact, so the Monitor and the Nogotuck, and the
                  Vanderbelt and cetery, hed to look on till the critter was got off, arter which it
                  made a tact acrost the harbor and retired with drums beatin and cullers flyin as a
                  triboot of respect to the asstoot head of our Navy Department. Isent it a shame
                  setch a funkshinary should be the alpher and onager of
                  our nobul mareen? Why doosent the ventabul old Rip Van Winkles retire from the
                  Naval burrow to Sleepy Hollow, whar he naterally blongs? We want a feller thar as
                  nose beens, and not an auntydiloovian as nose nuthen but has beens,
                  and barly that. Noah wouldent hev shipt setch an old fogy as a forrard hand to
                  holystone his blessed decks.
               The enemee in frunt continnees bizzy spadin up new airthwurks, but the punches
                  they git from our artillery ratyther damps thar ardent sperrits, often indoocin em
                  to thro down the shuvvel and the ho, and dig for saifter diggrins. Evry day thar
                  wurkrin parties fall back hafe a duzzen times for want of proper support, while
                  setch is the eggsellent provishin made for kiverin our trenchers that they air
                  allus full of pluck. The firing of Burden's sharpshooters inficks hevy losses on
                  the rebels. No sunner doos a gunner show than he's a goner. Thirteen was rubbed
                  out yestday while. spunging thar pieces, and still another who was sightin a
                  Parrott loaded with grape, reseved a bullet in the ball of each eye at the same
                  moment. The latter bein onable to see whar he was goin, walked strait inter the
                  Fedral lines, and altho kwite blind, is thort to hev a good look to rekiver.
               Our advance is now oney seven hunderd yards from thar outwurks, and when the wind
                  is right we ken hear em blastfeem. Ef profanity was fatill at that distance, we
                  should all hev ben to the devil longs ago, for the retches swar at us like
                  troopers. Misabul sinners—onackwainted with the provub that cusses is like
                  chickens, and goes hum for the same porpus—they little thinkin what hell-roosts
                  they air makin of thar onfortnit soles. Mebbe ef they hed hed as menny pius tracks
                  to guide em as we hev, they would never hev wanderd from the strait and narrer
                  path inter the broad way that leads to destruckshin.
               We ort to make allowances for the fact that they air destitoot of mishinaries, and
                  hev no coalporters to giv em informashin about the fire that is never kwenched.
                  Indeed they must be pitably ignorant about setch matters, otherways Bowerygard
                  would never hev egggspected to find water for his hoss whar it kant be obtained
                  for no price. But how kin you hop to find enny relidjus sentiment amung peeple as
                  hev no Sunday papers, and attends theayters on the Sabbath day, and persecutes
                  meek and lowly ministers of the gospel like Parson Brownlow?
               These remarks, howsever, is less shootable to a camp than a camp meetin. To return
                  to secklar matters: Purfessor Low has jest desended from the skies in his big
                  balloon "Agasis," and reports that Jeff Davis has arrived at Yorktown with suckers
                  to the amount of nine thousand men. He ses he counted the sojers, and he knew Jeff
                  by his long neck; but then the purfessor is sumwot given to stretchin. I remember
                  a few years ago, I gin fifty cents to see Low start from New York by the air line
                  for London, but arter raisin the wind, lo and behold, as tho Devil would hev it,
                  he oney went as far as the Elysium Feelds. My own bleef is, that most all the big
                  stories we hear about seecesh
                  re-enforcements and setch, amounts to nix; and, like the late rummer of a Union
                  defeat at Elizabeth, purceeds from the Father of Lize.
               Thar was a butiful shindy in the rebel lines yestday arternoon.
               Two ridgements hed a pursenal differculty, and we could see em firin into wun
                  another for hafe hour or so in a lively style, killin menny on both sides. It was
                  a puzzle to all of us why they should riddle wun anuther in a plug-muss, wen they
                  no well enuff that our men is spilin for a fight and reddy to put em throo at the
                  shortest notis. Howsever, its not onplesent to witness a bluddy ruff and tumble
                  atwixt two sets of ruffyuns, when wun reflecks that witchever of the skallywags
                  whips its all right for our side.
               A desarter who cum in about an hour ago, ses it was a skrimmidge atwixt a South
                  Caroliny ridgement and a boddy of Virginny Volunteers as was resently enlisted
                  agen thar will at the pint of the bagnet, and that the muttonneers hed the best of
                  it. When troops of Sister States pitches inter wun anuther arter this fashin, its
                  a sign that the ties of brutherhood is brokin, and that the affairs of the rebels
                  is approachin a crysis.
               The grand a salt was onavoidably postponed last week, on account of the rain, but
                  the day is now fixt, and it will cumn off at the appinted time, rain or shine,
                  wether or no. In the meantime evrything goes on as agreeably as the most
                  sanguinary frends of the Union could desire. I send you the oridginal plan of
                  attact (which hes senst ben changed), but in coarse you hev tact enuff not to
                  prent it. Seckatry Stantons standin order agen givin aid and cumfurt to the enemee
                  by foretellin past events, is still in full force, and as I dont want you to git
                  inter difficulty by predictin wot might hev happened onder circumstances witch
                  dident occur, you hed better not menshin to ennybody that if Ginral Maclellins
                  first projeck hed ben carried out it mought possably hev ben consummated. I hev
                  reson to no that I am onder the strick sirvillians of the Censer of the Press, and
                  tharfore ef Yorktown should be tuck on or about or before Saturday the third of
                  May, you musn't say I told you so.
               Hopin to date my nex with a pen dipped in Ginral Jonson's inkstand, I remain,
                  progressin faverably,

                  IN THE ADVANCE, BEFORE YORKTOWN, April 30, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The clerk of the wether arter keepin the winders of Hevin wide open for three days
                  and playin continually throo all the orifizzes with two and a hafe inch pipe,
                  suddently shet off the head of water, took in the seelestyal hose, and closed the
                  sashes on Monday last, senst witch this everlastin bog hes ben simmerin down,
                  dryin up, and generatin steam to keep the billyus fever bizness goin brisk and
                  lively. The seesin is oncommon faverable for fever and ager and the crop is likely
                  to be large. More'n two thirds of the wurkin parties engaged in erectin
                     shiver de freezes and cetery hes the chills more or less,
                  and buckets filled with a solushin of surfit of canine hes to be sent round to all
                  the pianeer hands three times a day to enabul 'em to face the mewsick. Ef it
                  warn't for that the jig would sun be up. As it is the shakedowns in the tempory
                  lazyretters is all full. Roomattics prevails considerabul in the low kwogmires,
                  and I kin ashoor you my asma in the chest hesent ben much improoved by wot the
                  doctors call miasma in the air. In fack the atmostfearic eggshellashins is wus, by
                  chorks, than the shells of the enemee. Ef we dont take the rebels down afore the
                  reglar hot wether sets in, thar'll be sum hevvy mowin dun in our ranks by the old
                  ripper Deth.
               In the meantime, as you air aware from the ushil ofishall sorces, evrything is
                  going on to the entire satisfackshin of evrybody. The diffrent camps hes ben
                  conneckted by blazing roads through the woods, and the sojers can now see whar
                  they're goin, insted of hevin to ax thar way continually in passin from wun post
                  to anuther. The blazin was rayther a tuff job as it hed to be dun onder the
                  enemees fire. Sevral thousand men is at present emplide in bildin corderoy
                  turnpikes. These corderoys is for the
                  breeching pieces; but the moreass bein eenamost bottomless in sum places, thar
                  construckshin is a wurk of amens labor. Sumtimes the tallest monarks of the
                  forrest, when laid down as sleepers, disappears like a dream, and uthers hes to be
                  embedded over em. Howsever the grate highway leadin throo the swamp to Warwick is
                  nearly finishit and will be thrown open to the milentary publick in a few days. It
                  is a bully road, about hafe the width of the bullywards at Payris, but skrarsly as
                  present to ride over. The ruts bein all the rong way, gun carridges passin over it
                  purgresses by jerks, like the innoomerable hop-toads on the bog on each side, and
                  about at the same lively pace. The fast crabs of the Third Avenoo couldn't make
                  three minnit time over it—not eggsackly.
               We've got to lick the fo, thats sartain, for this tung of land is too allmity saft
                  and slippery to back down on; so, as the king ses in the play, we must push
                  forrard, "seekrin for Richmound in the throat of Deth." I spose the bombardment
                  will openly in airnest next week, ef the wether is faverabul for firewurks, and
                  Ginrals Banks and MacDowell hes by that time skewerd good places for recevin the
                  rebels with outstretcht arms, as they rush from the eggsibishin. Wun thing you may
                  relic upon—nuthin will be dun ontill the time cums to do it, and then should
                  suckemstances prove onpropishus, it will oney be postponied ontill sumnthin
                  faverabul turns up. This informanshin I hev confidenshally from a very high sorce,
                  and I trust the Censer—altho I am in bad odor in that kwaruter—will suffer it to
                  pass.
               The tidins from the Lower Mussysippi, witch hev ben current here senst Monday, hes
                  defused a flud of joy throo all our harts. Lovill, it seems, cut dirt without
                  showin enny inclinashin for a brush. I remember he did jest the same when he was
                  Deppity Inspector in the New York Street Department. Gustarvus Smith, anuther
                  gradeate of the same nobul institooshin, will probly flee in a simlildar manner
                  from the besum of destruckshin. The ackount given by the rebel leaders of the
                  capter of New Orleanrs is rayther a frothy story but its plain enuff that arter
                  the vessels of Porter reached the city, nuthin more was seen of thar ugly
                  mugs.
               I went on a skout throo the air yest'day with the speshul airtist of a picter
                  sheet named arter a sellybrated ferry in this State. The way of it was this. The
                  airist hearin as the Guverment Censer hed cum full swing from Old Pint to arrest
                  him for givin aid and cumfurt to the enemnee, by copyin an old plan of
                  Cornwallis's and Washington's camps as they appered in 1781, detarmined mined to
                  go up inter God Almighty's free and blessed air, whar they dont hev no Censerships
                  and Seckatries of War hes no jurisdickshin, and to stay thar till the offishall
                  Poll Pry hed vamosed. I ackumpaanid him, and a jolly-time we hed; smokin
                  meershams, and sipping hideseek in the rejin of clouds, and now and then directin
                  our attenshin to the shampain kentry below most, of witch is adapted to the
                  cultivashin of terbacker. We both agreed that no man of voracity in his senses
                  would fix the census of the rebel army at more'n 70,000. We could see all the
                  ridgmental camps, and Ime sartain as all the corpses put together dident number
                  70,000 souls. The seecesh as was off duty presented a curus specktickle. They
                  seemed to be sittin without thar shirts perusin the papers. On vewin em throo a
                  tellascope, howsever, we notist they were employin thar valabul time in the
                  pershoot of vermin. Wot we at fast tuck for noosepapers, turnt out on closter
                  inspeckishin to be thar onderlinen, and judgin by the way they acted, cattle must
                  hev ben plenty and actyve in the dummestick market. My cumpanyun arter sketchin a
                  bird's eye view of the remains of the old fortyficashins at Yorktown—witch he gin
                  to me, and witch I intends to publish arter the war, ef not konsidered determental
                  to past events—preposed to me to descend aloan and inkwire ef the Censer hed
                  evaporated. I dun so. How did I desend aloan? you natrally ax. Wal, I shot down
                  down in a parryshoot. Perhaps you never seen a parryshoot. Its wot airynaughts
                  takes up with em as a safegard agen dannger in case of a kullasps. A balloon is
                  but an "airy nuthin" as the poick eggspresses it, and so its as well to pervide
                  for a rainy day with a parryshoot; witch is percisely like a big umbereller.
                  Siezin this masheen by the handel I jumpt from the car and floted gently, with a
                  wobblin moshin, to the airth, with no inconveenyance except a slite seatsickness
                  cawsed by the see-saw mosshin of the consarn. On arrivin below I inkwired for the
                  Censer and found he hed gon back to whar he belonged, wharupon I gin my frend abuv
                  the spred eagle signal—an Odd Fellow's sine in witch the fingers and the nose
                  takes a conspeakus part—and he immediently tuck the hint and cum down
                  hansumly.
               Hopin we may sun flounder outer this bog, kivered with lorils (witch is as common
                  as sassafrax all over the swamp, ef enny boddy wanted to gether em) I remane, deep
                  in the mud, but with curridge skrewed to the stickin place.

                  FORMER HEAD-KWARTERS OF GINRAL JO JONSON, WILLIAMSBUG, May 7,
                     1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               I rite this letter from a commojus manshin in Williamsbug, witch was suddently
                  vakated on Toosday night by Ginral Jo Jonson and a few of his seleck frends, to
                  make rum for Ginral Maclellin and his milentary famaly. The resent tenants was
                  cumpelled by pressin engagements to start for the inteeryur and genrusly left
                  evrything at our disposhal. I am now settin onto wun of Magruder's trunks, and
                  dippin my pen (as I sed in a resent letter mought sun be the case) in Ginral Jo
                  Jonson's inkstand. Immediently opposit to me sets Ginral Maclellin on a camp
                  stool, inditin a dispatch to his wife, on the back of a haversack, and I no by the
                  twinkel of his eye that he's puttin things in a light that'll make her feel as
                  happy as a toad in a shower. He's too much of a worrier to wurry her, even if
                  matters lucked skwally; but seein we hev given the pussnannymus cusses rats, in
                  coarse, he feels like a bird, and rites boyantly. Our departed frends doosent peer
                  to hev ben very tidy in thar habits. Empty whisky jugs, bucks on milentary
                  tacktricks, charts of the peninslur drord on the whitewashed walls with terbacker
                  juce, eppylets, boots as seems to hev hed thar soles run off with hard travel, and
                  setch artickles of clothin as perfeshinal runners diskards in a match agin time,
                  is prominent amung the embellishments of the apartment whar I am now turnin my
                  idees inter black and white. The floor presents a disgustin specktickle, bein
                  kivered with Confedrit kwids, no doubt spit out in a simultanus shower at the
                  moment of departer, to avide swallerin 'em in the wild rush to a more conjenial
                  locashin.
               But enuff of the sourcaustic. Seens of blud and cetery setch as I hev to deskribe
                  is too serous to be treted in my ushil vein. Regairdin the mane facks of the high
                  old rebel hunt witch commenst last Sunday at York Town and hes ben in full blast
                  ever senst, with allmity breef intermishins for recreashin, the tellagraft hes
                  allreddy posted you in advance of the mails. I shall tharfor, like the sellybrated
                  contraband in the play, confine myself self to the "har bredth scrapes and moovin
                  axdents" in witch I tuck a hand, pursenally, and witch the ornary curryspondents
                  of the press was too far in the rare to make a manyrandum of.
               The vamose of the rebels from York Town on Saterday night and Sunday mornin dident
                  take me by suprise. When the sege guns opend onto em to get the range, on
                  Thursday, I sed openly "they kant stand these doses, theymust evackyate." Saterday
                  night, sun arter turnin in, I hed a curus dreem. It seemed to me as ef a most
                  amazin critter rose up suddently out of the airth in my tent, like wun of the
                  stage sulfursides in Don G O Vanny. He hed the aperience of a flyin sarpint, his
                  wings bein in the form of a normons eppylets, and his boddy consistin of flexibul
                  two hunderd pounders taperin down to four and a half inch howitzers at the tail
                  eend. Ses he, rollin the red hot shot witch sarved him for eye-balls, in thar
                  sockits, as he spoke—"Ime the Milentary Annie Condy or Army Devil, I
                  am; wot Mephistufferlies was to Doctor Fostus, I intend to be to Unkel Sam, oney I
                  dont want to by souls on enny terms, hevin more on hand now than I ken find fewil
                  for. Would you like my fire-eatin frend," he continned, snappin his incinderary
                  eyes ontil the sparks flue, "to no wots up in the seecesh camp at this
                  junkter."
               "Ef youre the ainshint snake as got up the apple riot in Pairodice in the year
                  wun," ses I, "Ime no frend of yourn, for if it hedent a ben for your darned
                  strutegy, this mutch-to-be-laymented frayternal shindy mought never hey cum off.
                  Howsever," ses I, "I would like to larn how the blamed seecesh over to York Town
                  enjies thar invitin prospecks, ef the things possabul, my old Bore
                  Constructor."
               "Siss-s-s!" ses the tremenjus reptyle, rattlin his metallic karkiss and makin
                  annoys with his firy tung, like a duzzen hafe inch fuses goin on a blazin bender
                  throo the air: "Siss-iss-s-s-s! youre a nice feller to be down on me for
                  sirkimventin a cuppel of covetus, conseted upstarts, when your ginral wants to cum
                  the same game with the hull Suthern Cornfedracy. But we wont quarl old Ruff and
                  Reddy, ketch a holt of my tail."
               I dun so, and with a few virus flaps of his eppylet-wings we wus in the
                  oppersishin camp, when he muttered a few words too profane to be repeted in a
                  Sunday paper, and we both becum unvisabul. A moment arterwards we was in the midst
                  of a markee, in witch the head ginrals was holdin a consultashin on the rebel
                  case. Magruder was makin a speech, and as near as I ken remember the vishin, it
                  was as follers:
               "I go in for fighting as Old (hic)—I say, I go in for puttin em throo as Old (hic, hic) Hickory did at New
                  Orleens." (Ginral Lee interruptin—"New Orleens be cust!—its gon to thunder!")
                  "Gent'men, don't run; take a sober (hic) seckind thort, and stand firm." (Here he
                  pitcht forrard and run his seegar inter Ginral Jonson's eye.) "Rains ses ef we
                  stay here we shall be tuck by storm. Let her (hic)—I say, let her rip! Can we
                  eskape the fate of Corn (hic)—of Cornwallis by flyin to Chickenhominy? No,
                  gent'men, no. Ef we air to die in the last ditch, let em (hic) hack us to peaces
                  here." ("Hear, hear!" from the sojers listenen outside.) "This is class (hic)—I
                  would say classic ground. Ef we must fall, let us die all, die nobly die like
                  demni (hic)—like demi—"
               Here the speeker keeled over and sobsided, Lee whisperin to Jonson—"die like
                  demijohns, I spose the drunken humbug means."
               At this intresting pint of the vishin I was suddently awoke by the drum beatin the
                  long role, and an orderly rusht inter my tent with his eyes as big as sawsirs and
                  informt me that the seecesh hed abandoned thar wurks and it was a sekind edishin
                  of Manasses. In less'n twenty minits I was ridin throo thar desarted camp. In
                  coarse you hev larnt by the airly despatches, that it was as full of torpedoes and
                  infarnal masheens as a rebel blankit is of like stock, and as I rode along I herd
                  em crackin on evry side. Wun of em cum all thunderin near cuttin short my
                  curryspondence with the Merkary I ken tell you. Rite in frunt of the Rebel
                  Head-kwarters a shell eggsploded onder my Busufferless, and the next instant I
                  found myself sittin astride of a dismounted piece, with the saddle still onder me
                  and my feet in the stirups, mutch suprised but parfeckly saift. Thar was nuthin
                  left but me and the saddle. It was a merackalus eskape, and shows that Providence
                  never sleeps; for this was about four o'clock in the mornin.
               The hull of Monday I was with the right wing, with Hancock's brigade, in pershoot
                  of the flyin fo. In the final shindy on Monday arternoon, when we turned thar left
                  flank, I cum within a hars bredth of ketchin Magruder. Ef I'd oney hed a Californy
                  laureat to hev sent singin throo the air arter him, I mought hey noosed him shoor.
                  But alass I lost him for want of a lasso. His boss was a leettle
                  swifter'n mine, and bein drunk he swung about so in the saddle that I couldn't hit
                  him with my revolver. However, I hev his wallet witch he threw away as he fled,
                  hopin to tempt me to stop and skewer it. I pickt it up as I returnt, but found it
                  warnt wuth the trubble, containin nuthin but a few dunnin letters, an obseen
                  drinkin song, and a passel of Cornfedrit shin plasters.
               Last night the rebels wunst more tuck up thar line of march, at a kwarter-hoss
                  stride, and our troops are now arter em with a sharp stick.
               I rayther surmise the old Annie Condy is throwin her larvee around!
               Luck out for still more gloryus noose nex week. Nofolk is a gon case within a few
                  days. The seecesh game's eenamost played out. The beginnin of the eend is closte
                  at hand. In the arms of Victry (while the fo is on the last legs of Defeat), I

                     MACLELLIN.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               We air cornerin the Cornfeds amazin rapid. Desarters report as Howl Cobb is in
                  favor of vamosin Richmound without waitin to be shelled by Maclellin. Magruder,
                  who was so feerce for a stand when he was staggerin drunk, is now lyin on his back
                  at Rumford with the shakes, they say, and fancies he sees lejins of Illanoy apes
                  swimmin acrost the Pawmonkey River, with red-hot pokers in thar hands to stir up
                  his innards. A contraband as cum in last night ses Mrs. Davis hes mutinid agen the
                  Seecesh Presdent, slapt his face, and told the poor henpect critter that
                  Secceshin's a bad egg, and that she's hartily sick of setch a disgustin
                  yokefeller. The citysins of Richmound ginally is represented to be in a revoltin
                  state, and the saft soap of the rebel funkshinaries doosent appeer to hev enny
                  effeck upon em. Menny thinks it will be onpossabul to bring the Suthern troops to
                  the scratch, in consekens of the late disaster in Louseanna.
               
               Cumberland, our present head-kwarters, is oney about twelve milds from Bottom's
                  Bridge, whar Lee allows he's goin to whip us. He's got to fight or foot it right
                  away, that's sartain, for we shell be in moshin at dawn on Thursday mornin, for
                  the porpus of lettin daylight inter him and his Fly-by-nights. A currier hes jest
                  arrived from the James, who states that the Monitor was around Gurl's Neck, and
                  that the Gayleaner, witch got in a tight place by huggin the shore too closte, hed
                  ben got off with a tug, and was hard arter her, with the Nogoduck cummin up
                  hand-over-hand a short distans below. By refrence to the maps, you will see that
                  the James is as full of elbows as the Mincio—the wun around Gurl's Neck bein the
                  most dangerus bend of the hull, with the eggsepshin of wun near the mouth. Jeff
                  hes appinted Friday, the sixteent instant, as a day of humiliashin, and I
                  predicate our gunboats and land forces 'll carry out his proclamashin purty
                  effeckshally.
               The clerk of the wether, who seemed detarmind to drownd us out at Yorktown, hes
                  stopt cutting shines, and now we hev rayther more sun then we want. But as Gloster
                  ses to Norfolk in the play, "Wots that to us more'n to Richmound?" We ken stand
                  100 degrees of Foreign heat better'n one in a hunderd of the natives. And why ken
                  we do so? Why, bekase we aint everlastinly fired up with red-eye. Tork of licker
                  as 'll kill at forty rods! Blame my picter ef the stuff we found in sum of the
                  whisky barls at Yorktown wouldent kill as far as a Dollgrin gun.
               You never seen a finer kentry than this we air travellin throo now. Thars
                  planters' housen atween Williamsbug and Cumberland, that the most plus Christian
                  would hardly wish to trade for manshins in the skies. The corn's so flurishin that
                  it gives me pain to tred onto it, and it stirs the pulse of a feller's stummick to
                  luck at the green peas. As I set in the piazzer of Ginral Maclellin's
                  head-kwarters, scratchin off this letter, the notes of the robbings steals
                  plesently on my ear, and the mewsical catbirds tutches my felines with thar
                  cherful and familyar vices. The oney things that anoise me is the mockin-birds,
                  witch, in consekens of hevin lissent so long to the seecesh bands, sings nuthin
                  but "Dixie." I giv em Hail Columby, evry now and then, with a handful of stuns,
                  but, like the jail-birds as tootered em, they oney fly a little ways ahead and
                  strike up the same infarnal toon agin.
               We hev, as you're aware, kwite a number of furrin offsirs attached to this
                  divishin, and they wun and all declar that a finercore d'amme
                  never tuck the feeld. The Duc de John Veal told wun of our John Bull captins, when
                  he culre to see us at Barboursvil last Saterday, that "Villainton (that's the way
                  the French pernounce Wellington) nevare had so mosh fine troops in hees life."
                  "No," ses the Englishman, "that's a fack; and I dont see how he ever wun the
                  Battle of Waterloo." He led the Frenchman thar, I speckylate. The Duc de Chatters
                  and the County Payris is both here. They air jolly, convivyal young fellers, and
                  not averse to puttin down Old Bourbon when they git a chanst.
               Thar was grate rejisin amung our men when the noose arrove that Cummodore Davis
                  hed sent three of Hollinses Rams to Davys locker. He's a rambunkshus feller is
                  Hollins, but senst Porter and Davis sheared inter his rams at New Orleens and Fort
                  Pillow, I persoom he feels like a shepherd without a flock. Horns hes ben his
                  rooin. The best thing he ken do is to rite an affeckshinit farwell letter to his
                  frends (ef he hes enny), and then drap hisself inter the drink. I reckin he'd sink
                  jest as eesy as rollin off a log, for they've ben throwin hunderds of hogsheds of
                  whiskey inter the Mussysippi lately, and he'd go to the bottom arter it in
                  obejence to his nateral instinks.
               Our advance gard is now feelin the enemee, and the report is that he doosent feel
                  good, and that he is tryin to slip throo our fingers. Ef that's his game, he'll
                  hev to be as lively as a lanprey eel, for we are closte onto his slimy trail, and
                  Maclellin's grip is a thunderin titan. Sum prisoners sent in by the skrimmidgers
                  this morning, ses Lee is ankshus to meet us, and eggspects to cum off with flyin
                  cullers; but Ime afeard he'll go off with flyin cullers afore we git a chanst to
                  pitch inter him in the defiles. The oney cullers warranted to stand in these parts
                  is black and yaller. Cuffee, Dinah and Co. waits for us evrywhars with open arms,
                  and would gladly embrace us, but we eggscuse ourselves, on ackount of the warm
                  wether. We air in good odor with all the darkeys, but for all thar perfeshins of
                  fiendship, they air allus tryin to get to windward of us, ef they think they kin
                  make a cent by it.
               Hopin in my next to be able to say like the messenger in the drayma, "Richmound is
                  on the seeze," I remane, joyfully,

                  NEAR NEW BRIDGE, VIRGINNY, May 21, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Ginral Maclellin is a dissipul of Davy Crockett; he never bucks ahead till he sees
                  his way clar; but when he doos moove, sumthins got to suckum. I hope this time it
                  will be Richmound, and ef it hedent a ben for that thunderin blunderin bizness at
                  Fort Darling, we should probly hev carrid it afore now, by wot the Californy
                  blacklegs call a coo do grab. At the date of my last letter,
                  thar was evry aperience that we should hev it afore the sixteent, the day sot
                  apairt by Jeff Davis for a ginral humiliashin of the rebels; but Providence, witch
                  apeers to play an open and shet game with em, jest to aggravate their misforten,
                  thort it best they should hev two days of humiliashin insted of wun.
               Our advance is now near New Bridge, about nine milds from Richmound, and our
                  cavalry pickets is closte enuff to hear thar hosses nay. We onderstand that
                  remittent fever is playin old hob with em. Desarters report that from five to
                  sicks hunderd is taken down daily, and more'n hafe the army hes the shakes, more
                  or less. Thars considabul third day ager amung our fellers too, and buckets of
                  surfit of canine and whisky is past throo the ranks twiste evry twenty-four hours,
                  but the moment the cold stage is over the invalids is as hot as ever for a
                  fight.
               This mornin I went on an errornotic trip with Mr. Low and Kernil Stunman from this
                  pint. We reeched an elevashin of five hunderd feet, and hed a fine vew of all the
                  feeters of the landskip. Men, wimmen and children was running about the streets of
                  Richmound, aperiently in a panic, and but few troops was visabel eggsept over the
                  left near James River.
               Ef wun could vote hisself a farm somewhars around in these pairts, it wouldent be
                  bad to take. Ef thars to be enny confisticashin for the bennyfit of lyall heroes,
                  I should rayther like to hev Kernil Lee's White House farm, whar we bed our
                  headkwarters a few days senst. Its jest about the purtiest spot this side of
                  pairodice. Two things reckymend it—Ginral Washington spent the fust years of his
                  marrid life thar—and the land, eenamost without any pains, will perdooce thirty
                  barls corn to the acher. Paytryotic recolleckshins and present profit both
                  reckymends it, and it peers to me to be jest the place for a Disbanded Volunteer
                  to repose upon his lorrils. I must tork over the matter with my friend Abe. In the
                  anshent fuddle times the estates of traitors used to be bestode upon lyall men,
                  and I guess, as O Theller ses, Ive done the state some sarvice. Thars about three
                  hunderd niggers belongin to the farm I onderstand, and I wouldent mind carrying
                  out the ideer of gradjal mansipashin in relashin to em, by guaranteeing the
                  freedom of thar grate grandchilderd as fast as they arrive at the age of eighty
                  years. I reely dont know ennything on airth more desirabul than a fine plantashin
                  on the Pawmonkey River, with two or three hunderd likely "pussons held to labor"
                  thrown in. I think I could do better by em than sum of the longfaced saints in
                  white chokers as went to the Sea Islands about two munths ago to oversee the
                  plantin of cotton seed, but oney suckseeded in spilin the seed of Ham. Pius yarns
                  isent condoosive to the perduckshin of cotton yarn it seems.
               The Seecesh on the peninslur, findin it doosent pay to plant torpedoes, witch thar
                  own capterd offsirs and men hes to dig up at the resk of thar valabul lives, hes
                  taken to firin on flags of trooce, as a saifter way of committin murder. Thar's
                  jest wun way to stop these games, and that's hangin; and if it isn't resorted to,
                  and that right away, our men will be apt to squar accounts with the cowardly
                  ruffins thar own way.
               I was with Ginral Stunman in the brush at Bottom's Bridge, and a very purty foot
                  race it was. Ive seen considabul running in my day, but I never saw fellers
                  mounted on setch misabul hosses make setch good time as they did acrost the
                  Chickenhominy yestday; yet I warn't supprised at it when I seen the prisners we
                  tuck. Setch onmassaful spurs as they hed onto em I never seen outer Mexico. Thar
                  arms was all sorts and sizes, but thar warn't a pair of spurs amung em as wouldent
                  hev gon throo the hide of an elefant. Wot they cheefly depend upon in battel, is
                  thar spurs. The hull line advances to-day, so luck out for great news about
                  Saterday. Hopin for a fight, but fearin it'll be a fizzle, I remain,

               Bowerygard hevin slipt up on the idee of waterin his Busufferless in the

                  his brissels up like a Texas porkerpine, and swore he'd ether light his Havanner
                  in our camp on Saterday night, or smoke a brimstun regaly with Belzebub in the
                  Halls of Haidees. I understand that prevus to the war the Red Sulfur Springs in
                  this State was his favorit waterin-place, and I persoom in a future state he'll be
                  ackomidated at a Spaw whar the bevridge is of the same flavor, but hotter and
                  stronger, and whar thars heeps of black waiters in constant attendance to giv
                  visiters a horn. The probility is, the old blastfeemer meens fight—for the mane
                  boddy of the Cornfeds now shows a horsteal frunt south of the city, and we larn
                  they air in high sperrits over the retreat of Banks into Merryland. Onder these
                  suckemstances, I luck for a collushin afore the week's out, and we air all hopin
                  for a high old time, witch may cum off at enny moment. Ef we don't put em throo
                  for the massacree at Bull Run and the torpedoes at Yorktown, thars no perswashin
                  in saber bagnets.
               In the intrim our Ginral, who, as you may hev heerd, is eenamost wushipt by the
                  army, is by no meens an idol man. On Monday he put Ginral Porter at the head of a
                  considabul boddy of troops, and told him to go to Hanover, witch he dun, and,
                  arter a hevy skrimmidge, tuck the place. It was a big thing and you will eggscuse
                  me for crowin over it. Our loss when footed up will be a mere handful, as ushil;
                  but I kant state the figgers, becase, altho menny of the troops hes cum back, we
                  hev no returns. Our men dun well in the engagement, and the wownded hev ben dooin
                  as well as could be eggspected ever senst. The fo left wun hunderd and nine men
                  and a sutler ded on the field, and, singlar to relate, they were all shot in the
                  eye with grape shot—showin the unerrin ackaracy of our artillry. This I hed from
                  an eye-witness, a remarkbly clear-sighted volunteer from the Buckeye State.
               Our men berrid the enemee's ded in thar own riful-pits, witch came handy arter the
                  fateeg of slorter, and capterd five hunderd head of seccesh alive.
               The jography of Hanover, witch is the court-house town of Hanover county, and
                  contains six whiskey mills, two churches, a constabul, seven squires, and a jail,
                  besides about two hunderd white trash, that no jenteel nigger will assoshiate
                  with, is as follers. It is right on the Richmound & Fredericksburg Railroad,
                  mebbe twenty milds from Richmound; and so you see while Ginral Maclellin is
                  menassing Bowerygard's frunt, he hes also opened a fire in his rare. This, I
                  bleve, is what he sposed Ginral Macdoill was to do; but it seems that wunderful
                  milentary cheeftin, who hes ben pickin his teeth and jinglin his spurs in the
                  neyberhood of Fallmouth for the Lord nose how long, hes suddently ben ordered on a
                  fool's errant to Manasses, arter Jackson. He's a sprisin man, is Ginral Macdoill.
                  Settin aside Siezer, Hanna Bull, and Haveluck, he is eggsheld by few, and
                  eggseeded by nun. His former masteerly retreet from Manasses fully entitles him, I
                  should say, to be sent thar agen.
               Wot do you think of the Banks affare? We regard it here as an amazin peace of
                  strategy. A trap peers to hev ben sot for the rebels, and Banks and his five
                  thousand left for bait. Jackson, the poor ignarunt old rat, walked inter the
                  snare, tooth and toe-nail, and ef he happens to git off with a claw this time, in
                  coarse we must do as the old wumman did when she used her husband's boddy for
                     eel-bait—try for anuther haul. Boddies of men is of no consekens
                  when the objeck of leavin em to be butchered is preyswurthy. The eend sankshins
                  the meens. I trust, tharfore, that the reck of Bankses brigade doosent consider
                  thar cumraids was recklessly sacrifised at Frunt Ryal, Winchester, and cetery; and
                  that no wun is so inhuman as to blame the cam, considerate, high-minded,
                  far-seein, liberal perfound, curtshus, and desarvedly poplar Seckatry of War. The
                  hull army of the Potomac considers him a nincumpairable publick offsir, and altho
                  sartain editors hes thort fit to call him a bag of wind, he is reely a man of
                  grate saygassity.
               Senst the abuv parrygraft was it, informashin hes ben receved in camp that Ginral
                  Freemount is to re-enforce Banks, witch will leeve the Mountin Deestrick at the
                  marcy of the gorillas. But the cuttin of a hunderd or two Union throats, more or
                  less, is naterally a seckindary considerashin to ketchin Jackson. They'll hev him,
                  mark my wurds, jest as shoor as Paddy capterd the flee.
               I notis thars considabul sed in the New York papers you sent me about Union sentiment in Virginny. But we don't
                  see it. Ef it eggsists in these parts, the peeple hes a high old talent for
                  dissimerlashin They wun and all greet us with the kinder epithets ushilly applied
                  to the skum of the airth, and nuthin but pursenal considerashins pervents the
                  wimmen from runnin thar sissors inter us. I wunst was tuck prisner by the
                  Cummanchy Injuns, and I must say thar squors treeted me with more perliteness than
                  the ladies of the Fust Famalees shows to our sojers. They don't say mutch, but
                  they spit with remarkabul force and ackaracy, and no longer ago than yestday a
                  Massachoosets man who offerd his cheek to a volunteer saloot from one of em, hed
                  the peace tuck out as clean as ef it lied ben dun with a gouge. Ef that's Union
                  feelin, I ken oney say Ive no wish to put my mousetushes in setch a persishin as
                  to procure me a simildar token of regaird.

                  IN FRUNT OF RICHMOUND, June 4, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               As youre awar I was at the battel of Inkerman and also seen the famus charge of
                  that impetyus British trump Lord Cardgain at Blacklaver, but the fightin in these
                  diggins last Saterday and Sunday was sumthin to holler on even arter witnessin the
                  rushin work in the Crymeah. Saterday the rebels druv us for a wile, thars no
                  denyin that; but by Genesis! it was oney by the force of numbers. About
                  twenty-five thousand of em pitcht oneggspecktedly inter Ginral Caseys Brigade in
                  the midst of setch a storm as no rayshinall beins wuld hev thort of facin without
                  injy rubber overcoats and umbrellers. It litened to that degree that youd hev
                  sposed the biggest fool on airth would hev ben struck with the danger of carryin a
                  musket; but regairdless of the legtrick flewid, they thunderd down upon our
                  advance like a hurrycain. Ginral Caseys Brigade receved the fust shock. Drencht
                  with rain, they was standin shiverin in a corn feel when they suddenly found
                  tharselves atwist three tires. Thar persishin was singlarly pictoresk, bein purty
                  mutch surrounded with woods, and altogether a nice seekwesterd spot for a picknick
                  party. Ef the enemee hedent misfortinately got inter the timber in frunt of em,
                  and on both flanks, they mought hev held the fo at a ded lock sum time, but as it
                  was they bolted. They retreted in order—sum ses in good order, but accordin to the
                  best informashin I ken git, it was in short order. Menny of our offsirs allows
                  that a feeld with woods on three sides of it isent an overly saift place in a
                  milentary pint of view, onless the woods is ockapied as well as the open, but in
                  coarse when men meets with a reverse, evryboddy ken see how it mought hev ben
                     vicey versey.
               I was with Ginral Maclellin when the noose of the attact was brort to head
                  kwarters, and as ushil on setch ockashins, the eggstent of the disaster in frunt
                  was falsely stated by the fudgetives.
               But it made no more impreshin onto him than the firy bolts did onto A Jacks. He at
                  wunst sent two brigaids by the cars to the van, and the fresh troops goin in with
                  cheers sun turnt the tables. The battel continyin with onabaited fury, the steam
                  was kept up and other boddies dispatched from time to time, ontil Night hysted her
                  star-spangled banner over the cumbertents, and the work of deth was suspended.
                  When they could no longer see to shoot, both sides laid down on thar arms and
                  tried to refresh tharselves with a littel sleep prevus to meetin on Sunday.
               At daylight on the blessed Sabbath—long afore you city fokes had begun to dress
                  for church—we dressed our ranks and went in. It was Unkel Sam's turn now, and we
                  made old seecesh see stars. Hindsellman raked em fore and aft with his artillry
                  and musketry, and Sedgewick and Richardson gin em pertickler fits. As sun as our
                  men got the enemee outer the woods inter the open, whar they hed full skoop for
                  the bagnet, they gin em the cold iron. The Sutherners dont peer to keer a chaw of
                  tobacker for bullits, but they wont stand spittin. When they see the shinin steel
                  cummin at thar brests, they loose hart, and run like deers for deer life. But
                  runnin dident save em this time, for they was run throo by hunderds. Four hunderd
                  is sed to hev ben wiped out by the bagnet alone. I counted more'n a hunder myself
                  in one peace of swompy ground, and at least fifty of em was speared throo the backr. It was an orful sight,
                  and I wisht that sum of youre New York blud-and-thunder kwill-drivers as prefers
                  slorter to circumvenshin, could jest hev rode over the battel-feeld with me last
                  Monday mornin, and seen the glassy eyes and pale upturnt faces that bore silent
                  witness agen war, wile the green airth was wet with dimond doos, andi the birds
                  was singin hims of peace among the bushes whar menny of the wounded hed crawld
                  away to die.
               The victry was cumpleat; but I dessay sum of your pen-and-ink Ginrals, as sets in
                  thar editorial sanktums and plans onpossabilities, will take thar tex from Caseys
                  discumforture acnd say "the Army of the Potomac was defetd."
               I warent mutch in this last battel, hevin ben prencepally emploied doorin both
                  days in carryin orders from the cummandin Ginral to the different corpses to moove
                  forrard or fall back, as ockashin reckwired. This, howsevecr, is a critterkill
                  kinder sarvice as you may sirmise from the fack that I hed six hosses shot onder
                  me; and wunst, wile lyin on the ground, a hoos shot over me, strikin a pistil I
                  hed razed to plugs him, with his flyin heels. Wot is most extrornary, the kick
                  discharged the pistil and the ball strikin the animal in a vital spot kild him
                  instantly. In takin an order to Ginral Hindsellmann I hed to ride throo a
                  cross-fire of grape and riful balls of a most eggsitin nater,
                  dooring witch three bullits passed throo my milenetary flapjack and wun ludged in
                  my stop-watch, and I found on resortin to my terbacker-box for a chaw, arter
                  getting outer range, at fift hed perpetrated the lid and lodged in the Cavindish.
                  I hev sent the box with the buillit and the terbacker inter it to Fortress Monroe
                  to be forrarded to the SUNDAY MERKARY offiz, and I wish you, to sho
                  it to all inkwirin trends as a pruff that the old sojer dident srink from dooty in
                  the face of danger.
               Our advance line is now right in frunt of the intrenchments at Richmound, and not
                  more'n three miles from Jeff Davises House.
               If Richmound is tuck I shall get a furlo, and go to Washington to recrute—I mean
                  to recrute my sperrits, for wot with seens of carnedge by day and dreemin of em at
                  night, Ime getting to be wot the docters calls a hippocorndrake.
               I larn to-day that our gunboats is wunst more asendin the James and that the grand
                  attact on the enemnee is to cum off within a week. Hopin that it will hev a

                  BEFORE RICHMOUND, June 9, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Senst the battel of Fair Oaks (or Fair Hoax as wun of our line offsirs of the
                  British perswashin calls it) things hes remained stashinary, with few adventers to
                  relate wuth pen ink and paper. Fact is, both sides was so all-slorterusly cut up
                  in that sangwinary struggel that all hands felt inklined to paws for a spell,
                  prevus to attemptin enny new feet of arms. The hull affair was as like the two
                  days shindy at Shylow, as wun little nigger is like its bruther. The rebels dun a
                  purty good six hours wurk on Saterday, and we paid em off, and sumthin over by way
                  of advance, on Sunday. Mutch, howsever, depends upon the Seckatry of War. If that
                  extrornary institooshin orders up the nessary re-enforcements, the seecesh army
                  will be defeated and disburst; but ef, on tuther hand, he refewses the the
                  reckwired suckers, we may find it onpossabul to git perssesshin of their
                  formandouble brestuwurks ockapied as they air by the cream of the Suthern
                  infantry. Its all very well for noosepaper curryspondents to poke fun at the
                  shabby aperience of the enemee, but it doosent foller bekase a sojer is drest in
                  butternutts that he's milksop, and I ken tell you the hard luckin cusses fight
                  jest as hard as they luck. More over they outnumber us in the preporshin of more'n
                  three to two, and ef the spasmodic Head of the War Department wishes to avide bein
                  tuck with anuther panicky pericksism like that he hed when he rit to the Guvner of
                  Massachusets for help, he'd better make shoor of a Union victry by puttin fresh
                  troops on the rout without delay. Report ses that the Seckantry was orfully
                  shagreened at the way merry Andrews larfed at him about the Banks
                     fieaskoh; so prehaps he'll steer clar of simildar
                  Tomfooleries in futer. He nose wot would make Ginral Maclellin's sucksess sartin.
                  Will he do it? Nose verrons, we shall see, as they say in
                  Payris.
               Wen the losses on both sides at the battel of Fair Oaks cums to be figered out—ef they ever air—I predicate they
                  will foot up a totil of not less'n sixteen thousand, witch is about wun thousand
                  more'n the French and Ostreans lost at the famus fight of Mayrungo, whar Bonypart
                  licked Ginral Melasses army too de sweet, as he eggsprest it.
                  Richmuound papers confesses to ten thousand on thar side and its well-known here
                  that we hed over six thousand wiped out, wownded and captivated, besides loosin
                  seventeen guns, of witch, howsever, nine was retuck tord the tail-eend of the
                  shindy. It was ondoubtedly a Union tryump, bekase the rebels faled in their
                  objeck, but it was deer bought, and cum thundering near proovin an orful sell.
               All the divishuns of Ginral Maclellin's army is now acrost the Chickenhominy,
                  witch at present is a neverlaunch of foemin waters, in consekens of the late
                  inondashun. The Army of the Potomac must take no steps backards, ses the cummandin
                  Ginral, and I can oney say that if it skedaddles onder present suckemstances, its
                  likely to sheer the fate of the Duck of Clarence, in the play, and git-drownded in
                  the drink.
               Casey's divishin witch cum so near bein a case in the late engagement, is quitted
                  of all blame for quittin the feed in confushin. Few of the human race would hev
                  dun utherwise. The outside presshur was equil to five to wun, and ef that isent a
                  suffishent resin for caving in, then a man wouldent be jestified in jumpin off a
                  high presshur Mussysippi steamboat, when he sor the firemuen rollen bars of pitch
                  inter the furness, and the enginear settin astride on the saifty valve making his
                  last will and testyment. The brigaid was put in advance to feel the enemee, and
                  hevin felt of em and findin em too hevvy to handel, they let go suddently and fell
                  back. "Setch things is common," as Hamlet's unkel remarks in the tradegy, jest
                  afore he pledges the yung prence in the flowin bole. But thar'll be no more of
                  these affairs, bekase why, the divishins is all within close sportin distans of
                  wun anuther, and detatched boddies wont hev to fight for hours onsupported, on
                  thar own hooks, as Hooker did at Williamsbug and Casey would hev dun at Fair Oaks,
                  ef his troops hedent marveld to the rare.
               Our line of pickets is now so closte to the enemee's that both hes to play possum
                  all they no, with all thar injun tricks to git a saift shot at won anuther, ten or
                  a duzzin is put throo on thar side and about hafe as menny on ourn, evry
                  twenty-four hours. Skrimmidging is also goin on purty mutch all the time atwixt
                  the mounted reckonnoiterors, and last night twenty-five of thar light dragoons
                  rode inter wun of our advance camps in the dark, by mistake, and bein hemmed in,
                  it is needles to say they was sewed up in short order. In coarse, these promiscuss
                  brushes must eend in the mane boddeies gettin inter each others har afore long,
                  and nex time thar'll be no let up ontil wun side or tuther is a goner.
               Two balloons was up to-day, and brort down informashin that at least forty
                  thousand seecesh is onder arms within a mild and a hafe of our outposts, and that
                  many of the ridgments peered to be corned and a salting wun anuther. Deserters
                  also ses that things ginrallly is in an orfull pickel in the rebel camp, and that
                  the sojers is clamrus for thar back pay, and grately soured by the treatment they
                  hev receved from the Cornfedrit guverment.
               These stories may be on the squar, but its jest as likely thars no more solid

                  [In the absence of stirring incidents, our venerable military correspondent
                     sends some interesting intelligence from Richmond, furnished by refugees from
                     that city. He does not guaranty its accuracy. The Disbanded seems to suppose
                     that McClellan will be attacked before he has completed his arrangements for
                     taking Richmond according to Jomini. We think it quite likely. The ignorant and

                  NEW BRIDGE NEAR RICHMOUND, June 19, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Spades is trumps. The shuvvels mityer'n the sword. In planer words, Ginral
                  Maclelin is droring lines of circumvaluashin around Richmound and infestin it
                  accordin to the rules of war. The seeccesh Army wonder Ginral Lee heving ben
                  tremenjusly increast lately, this seems to be the saiftest way, of redoocin it.
                  Consekently we air advancing, by regular approaches and the sojers emplied in
                  constructin the pairallels finds it rayther hard lines. The heat is so intens that
                  the men in the wurkin parties drap down by duzzens. But regairdless of the firy
                  suns of the South, our brave fellers
                  continny thar prodigus efforts and air gradjally hedgin in the fo with milentary
                  ditches and uther works of afence. Laborin in the bowels of the airth perdooces
                  menny vialent disinteric cumplaints, but thars no grumblin; evry volunteer bein
                  desirus of dooin his utmost to eend this horrabul intestin struggel.
               Onless we air attacted you needent luck for enny smashin wurk in these diggins for
                  sum time, tho thars more or less shelling on both sides evry day, jest to keep the
                  ball in moshin. The sege guns as carries the hunderd pound slugs ken oney travel
                  at a snails pace throo the orful slows in our rare, and ontil they air all mounted
                  no attemp will be made to mount the enemee. In the meantime our cavalry is scourin
                  the kentry, and makin a clean sweep over the gorrillas in the Pawmonkey Swamps.
                  Yestday Kernil Averill seezed a lot of hosses in the neybrood of Metapony Creek,
                  also cuttin off severall waggins that the rebels was too much in a hurry to wait
                  for, besides ketchin more'n twenty seecesh simperthisers as hed bed a jolly time
                  givin informashin to Jackson's fillybusterin troopers, but is at present larfing
                  on the rong side of their mouths. They hev ben put in irons for sheerin in the
                  rebel steelins.
               Three Union refewgeese from Richmound, who hed suckseeded in alludin the enemees
                  sentnells, disguysed as contrabands, in curled hoss-hair and lam black—a dark
                  night faverin thar eskape—arrove in our camp this mornin at daybrake. They broke
                  outer Castil Godwin, whar they wur lyin onder sentens of deth, and thar noose, if
                  correct, is of the hyst interest. The hull tail would be too long for your
                  collumes, but the follerin is a few particklers of thar narrativ:
               In the subbubs of Richmound the rebels hev a hunderd and ninety-nine thousand
                  men—more or less. Thar air sum green recrutes, but upon the hole the men air all
                  well drilled. Gustarvus Smith, the New York gutter-skraper hes charge of the
                  provishin depoes, and by his advice the raw cornfederit conskrips is used
                  prencepally in the cookin department. Longstreet's divishin is practisin the
                  manover of formin in solid squar. This is the same Longstreet as was sent to the
                  West with orders to stop all the avenoos of communicashin with our Lane. Smith and
                  Longstreet doosent agree. Smith ses Lungstreet orter hev swept Casey and Couch
                  from the feeld, at the battel of Fair Oaks, and Longstreet allows that the oney
                  sweepin charge ever made by Gustarvus was agen the corporashin of New York. Ginral
                  Early's divishin is the latest milentary arrival at the cornfedrit capital. A
                  large majority of the peeple of Richmound is furious Unionists, but keep dark for
                  fear of gettin hung by the Seecesh minority. The purceedins of the niggers is a
                  nigma to evryboddy, but they air around in alarmin numbers, and a black cloud
                  seems to be impendin over the devoted city. The place is not onhealthy, but the
                  populashin is getting thinner evry day in consekens of the drafts. The jails air
                  full of pollytickle prisners, who air fired at whenever they cum to the bars of
                  thar cells, witch, in coarse, is gratin to thar felines. They air hafe starved,
                  and all thar petishins for better fare oney illicit an eggative from the sentnels
                  placed at thar doors by the provost marshal Winder, an offsir with a forbiddin
                  mouth and repulsiv Roman noes. Randolf, the seecesh Seckatry of War, was formally
                  a misabul shyster about the Richmound courts, and is a harder christian than his
                  predecessor Jew Benjiman. Jeff Davis lucks orful pail. Menny thinks he will sun
                  kick the bucket. He wares a long shabby sirtoot that was his weddin coat when he
                  marred Ginral Tailor's darter. His bhr is iron gray, and his hat, witch is of the
                  tallest stove-pipe pattern, is disgracefully rusty. Felin that he is brandied with
                  etarnal infamy he hes recently taken to drink. Report ses he is a pray to remorse,
                  and sumtimes weeps all night long, witch ackounts for the catarack in wun of his
                  eyes. Mrs. Jeff, who is a bucksum lady, takes things more filasofacoolly. She
                  drives throo the streets with a pair of fast bays, in a splendid bayrush, evry
                  arternoon, and is got up with white and red cockaids in gorgeus stile. Most of the
                  stores is closed; both the stock and the propriators hevin ben propriated for the
                  use of the guverment. The rebel wimmin ginrally is ongodly sassy. They hev small
                  speciments of the American flag nailed to all thar door-mats, for the conveenyance
                  of wipin thar feet and spittin on the Star-Spangled Banner evry time they enter
                  thar housen. They also assembul in large numbers daily in frunt of the jail, and
                  spit at the Union prisners throo the bars. Thars wun set as calls tharselves the
                  pro-slavery Amazons, who subscribes a five-cent shinplaster a peece at evry
                  meetin, and the member as spits with the greatest ackaracy takes the pool. They
                  hev named this pleasin divershin Eggspectorashin Loo. No licker ken be had
                  anywhars but at Guvner Letcher's, whose black boddy-sarvant brings him six gals of
                  the best Mungoheeler brand from public store evry twenty-four hours. Consekens is
                  that his levies is attended by throngs of the elect. Daniels of the
                  Eggsaminer gives him a punch now and then, but that is oney bekase he is not
                  invited to pardizzzypazte in the
                  whisky. Hevy cases, sposedt to contain gold, is frekwently sent South by the rebel
                  leaders on varus speeshius pertences. They air directed to Tuskalooser, Alabam,
                  witch indooses menny to spose that thar jaw about conkerin or dyin at Richmound is
                  all a lie.
               Tht abuv items, coppid from my manyrandom buck, is jest as they fell from the lips
                  of the refewgeese. You ken bleeve ass mutch of em as youre a mine to, or as
                  littel. The fudgetives hevin ben in close confinement for four munths, its
                  wunderful how they pict up thar informaashin; but far be it fromn me to accuse the
                  poor beggars of wilful mendicity.
               Ginral Prim visited. our camp last week, and I was present at his interview with
                  Ginral Maclellin. He sed our troops was fully ekwill to the high-soled Spanish
                  sojers as leathered the Moroccoes, and complimented the ginral on makin his
                  approaches accordin to the rules laid down by Jo Minie.
               Ef the rebels wait till our pairallels is completed, we'll bag em shure; and ef on
                  tuther hand, they hev the onpairalleled asshurance to pitch inter us afore were
                  reddy, they'll run agen a snag. Awaitin the issoo with the most sangwinary hops of
                  sucksess, I remain, ondawntedly,
               
                  Yours allus,

                  [The great fight before Richmond, our correspondent thinks, is close at hand,
                     and his spirits rise with the prospect of an immediate combat. We invite
                     attention to the diagram showing the positions of the two armies. If correct,
                     the rebels are "outflanked", and in imminent danger of being "crushed".
               
               
                  
                     IN FRUNT OF RICHMOUND, June 25, 1862.
                     Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
                  
                  Matters in this kwarter air rapidly drawin to a head—brushes is gettin more
                     lively and frekwent, and onless the rebels skratch dirt mity kwick, we shell
                     comb thar har afore the cumin Forth. Evry day brings us a little nearder thar
                     lines, and enabuls us to form a better estimit of the strenth of thar
                     collumes.
                  Jest as sun as Ginral Maclellin gits all his big Parrots up and his magazeens
                     reddy, he will attact the rebel wurks without further preeface. In the meantime
                     reenforcements are daylie arrivin, and the Ginral-in-Cheef thinks we hev kwite
                     as menny Helpers as the Crisis rekwires. Ses I to him no longer ago then last
                     Sunday:
                  "Ginral, ef you oney hed all them Nuthern melishy whoos offers of service
                     Seckatry Stanton was deef to becase they declined to list for three 'ears, wot
                     everlatstin short wurk you'd make with Lee, Longstreet and Co."
                  "My brave and venabul frend," he replide, returnin my respectful saloot with
                     his ushil curtsey, "sperrit makes good the want of numbers. Did you ever read
                     Henry the Fift's stump speech to his army afore the famus battle of A Gin
                     Court, whar the Constabul of France was killed?"
                  "Never," ses I.
                  "Wal," ses he, "Ile kwote you a passidge." And openin a vollum as lay on the
                     camp table beside him, he red as follers: 
                        
                           "'If we air marked to die, we air enuff
                           To do our entry loss; and ef to live,
                           The fewer men, the grater sheer of honor.'
                        
                      That's Shakespere," he remarkt, shuttin the buck, "and that's
                        me!"
                  "Bully for you," ses Raymond of the Times, who enterd the tent
                     at that moment, "you put me in mind of my grate annsister, Raymond of Tooloose,
                     who figgerd in the Holy Land—by Jeroosalum!"
                  It isent offen the eddytur-in-cheef of the Times gives way to
                     setch abolishing of enthoosiasum, for, like the Ginral-in-Cheef of the Army,
                     he's remarakbly moddest and onassoomin; so much so that, atltho he wunst headed
                     a sucksessful and sellybrated retreat in Italy, he rarly boasts of his
                     milentary eggsperience.
                  We hev hed sum sharp fitin to-day on our left, whar the enemee for sum time
                     past hes ben pickin off our pickits purty noomerusly. Seecesh was spunky, and
                     it was a ded lock for a wile, but finerly we carrid the key to wun of thar
                     persishin's. Thar was also a lively artillry dooil on the right, it which the
                     rebel battrees got fits from Fits John Porter. It is the universal opinyun in
                     camp that this skrimmidging may or may not proove the immejut prelimindary to a
                     ginral engagement. We hev gained considabul ground to-day, and the rebels may
                     try to re-ockapy it to-morrow. Ef they do, thar'll be a shindy ekwill to
                     Sulphurino. I oughter menshin, as wun of the sines of an approachin battle,
                     that a gang of Congressmen as hed cum to head-kwarters to pick uop a few idees
                     for bunkum speeches on the conduck
                     of the war, skedaddled yestday like a flock of harang-otangs when they smell a
                     tiger in the jungel. I reckin its purty saift to profesy that the grand
                     conflick will cum off within ten days. Seems to me thar must be
                     ether a fight or a foot race twixt this and Independence. In the meantime, you
                     ken form a traffic idee of the relative persishins of the two armies from the
                     follerin ackarit diegram, witch I obtaned from a very civil engineer. I
                     eggspeck the milentary censer will go inter asterisks wen he sees it, but arter
                     he cums too he'll prehaps see that it isent desined to designate our desines to
                     the enemee, and so let it slide. The upper seckshin of the plan reperscnts the
                     persishin of the Nuthern heroes musterd in arms under the spangled flag, and
                     tuther that of the Suthern Neroes standin in alarm under thar mangled rag:
                  
                     
                  
                  Slowly but surely, ef nuthin occurs to spile the strutegic moovement, the upper
                     seckshin will close in from the jint, like a pair of callipers, ontil the two
                     eends meet and the rebel crowd is druv inter a promiscus heep, and completely
                     enwollopt and cut off. This is a strikin improovement on the oridginal
                     sarpentine plan, and it is thort will anser to a T. Ef the fo chuses to attact,
                     so mutch the wuss for them, becase then the strutegic masheen will close
                     suddently with a snap, and the skweedge will be still more fatil. It is not
                     onpossabul that the last menshint catastropy may happen within forty-eight
                     hours, and that you may larn the trap hes ben sprung, by the wires, afore you
                     git this missiff by the post.
                  Desarters continnes to cum inter our lines at the rate of forty to sixty a day,
                     and ef theyre to be bleved-mind, I say ef theyre to be bleved—the Richmounders
                     is in a blamed poor way. The lucksheries of life in that volupshus city
                     consists of half rashins of corn-dodgers and wurmy pork; and sum of the F. F.
                     V.'s indulges on Sundays in weevely hominy and salt fish. I reckin that part is
                     troo, for a more lantern-jawed, herrin-gutted, grub-forsakin,
                     short-allowance-luckin set of ragged castaways was never taken off a raff at
                     sea, arter the oridginal number hed ben redooced wun hafe by cannabullism. As
                     to takin the oath, they'd swar a legions to Bellzebub for a bellyfull of beef
                     and a horn of red-eye. They state that the peaceabul citysins is offerin fifty
                     dollars a peace for substitoots, and that most of em turns out bad eggs and
                     skedaddles at the first opportoonity. They say also as the rebel ginrals
                     encurridges the men to fight by tellin em thars plenty to eat and drink in the
                     Union camps, and that thar desput charges is not caused so mutch by seckshinal
                     hatred as feroshus hunger. Sum may larf at this, but for my pairt Ide rayther
                     meet a feller in battle that hed a bone to pick with me pollytickally, then a
                     chap as wanted to be inter my meat house becase he thort the way to dinner was
                     over my ded boddy. Famishin retches would as leve hev thar goose cooked wun way
                     as anuther.

                  This mornin I rode over the seen of yestday's runcounter. We druv the enemee
                     over three hunderd yards, and our advance is now outer the saft swomp and
                     tangled underbrush on solid terror firmer. Our loss is about twenty-five killed
                     and mebbe about two hunderd wownded, be the same more or less-probly more. All
                     is perfeckly kwiet at present, but the hull army will sleep to-night with wun
                     eye open. Blevin that Seecesh is in airnest this time, and that a momentuous

                  NEAR TUREYBEND, July 1, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The issoo of five days of the most sevagarus fighten that ever tuck place in this
                  hemispear may be skweeged inter three words. We air whipt. Its hard
                  to say, and harder to bare, but we hev met the enemy and ben kompelled to turn
                  back. The malishus fo will swar that we fled in dismay; the dispatches to the
                  Guverment will claim that we retreated in good order. Make a ginral avridge of the
                  two stories, and you will be as near the trooth as a noosepaper ken eggspect to
                  git in these mendashus times. Abuv all,
                  don't place enny faith in the curryspondence of the daylie press, for to my
                  sartain nolledge most of the quill-drivers for the New York jernils is, and hes
                  ben ever senst Thursday last, in a mental condishin witch holy incapassitates them
                  from collectin thar idees, and ef the colleckshin was made, it would be about as
                  much like the facks of the case as a last years skarecrow is like the statoo of
                  Ginral Jackson at Washington. As to the detales, it would take a vollum of your
                  valabul paper to give em in full, or even hafe full—but I will say this, that
                  senst grit was developt in the human fammaly, it never was more conspickusly
                  displaid than it hes ben by the army of the Potomac, doorin its advance backards
                  under the preshure of sooperior numbers, from the Chickenhominy to Turkey bend. We
                  hev probly lost ten or twelve thousand men, and mebbe thirty or forty cannon, big
                  and littel, but we air now saift on the banks of James River, whar the broadsides
                  of more'n a duzzen gunboats will assist in layin the seecesh flat on their backs
                  ef they renoo the attact. We mowed em down for two hours yestday arternoon, in
                  reglar swaths, and I dont bleve they'll try it on agen on a suddent.
               The carnidge in both armies doorin the six days conflick has ben prodijus, but I
                  bleve that fur every two Union men wiped out about three rebels hes been
                  squelched. They gin us volly for volly, and more too, but our aim was the best,
                  and we hed the biggest lump to fire at, consekently the heft of the slorterus
                  reciprossity was on our side.
               The hull avalabul force onder Ginral Maclellin at the beginnin of the fight, was
                  rayther less than ninety thousand men, while the rebels hed full a hundred and
                  fifty thousand, and Ginral Stunwall Jackson arterwards rushed in with forty
                  thousand more. He's a smart man, is Stunwall—eenamost as remarkabul as a skillful
                  sojer as Freemount is as a nincumpoop—and that's payin him a high complement. In
                  coarse we eggspected his case would be attended to by the Shunandoor Ginrals, but
                  they patterned their tacktricks arter Ginral Patterson, when he was orderd to
                  pitch inter Johnston, and the consekens was that Jackson cum down upon us jest in
                  the nick of time, as Johnston did on Macdoill at Bull Run.
               I spose the same wunderful saygasity as weakened Bankses army when Jackson was
                  re-enforced, hes afforded this ruff and reddy rebel this new opportunity to
                  destingwish hisself at our eggspense. Westurn Virginny is said to be the Seckatry
                  of War's pet milentary deestrick, his speshil manoverin ground; and I trust when
                  the histry of that immens statesman, accomplisht sojer, and imminent telygraft
                  operator is ritten, his brilyant sarvices to his kentry in that rejin will receive
                  doo honor. Ef I was good at panijerk, I wouldn't mind pronouncin a ulowjim on him
                  in advance; but Ime afeard it wouldn't be appreshiated by the awjence by which I
                  am at present sirrounded. Indeed, the probility is that if I was to venter the
                  eggsperiment, I should be linched by the foot-soar, powder-siled, bleedin, groanin
                  thousands who hev jest ben ordered to prepair for anuther retreat of ten milds,
                  from Turkey bend to Harrassin's Bar. Setch is prejewdice. My cumraids, wun and
                  all, bleve that Seckatry Stanton is at the bottom of all thar misfortins, and
                  responsabul for thar discumforture. A minister in Japan, under a simildar cloud,
                  would whip out his swoord and hurry-skurry hisself at wunst-the idee in Japan bein
                  that when an offishal is thort to hev made a stab, axedental or otherwise, at the
                  vitals of the State, he is bound to insert a few inches of cold iron inter his
                  own. But in this kentry thars a more massyful way of gettin outer the diffikulty.
                  An onpoplar minister may resign or he may be kickt outer offis inter everlastin
                  obskewrity. Prehaps ef the illustrus head of the War Department was to take the
                  former method of retirin on his lorils, it mought be satisfactory to an ongrateful
                  kentry. Republicks is setch thankless consarns that I shouldent be sprised ef
                  three-forths of the commoonity would rejice at setch a catastrofy. Sumwhars in
                  profane history, I reckin it must hev ben in Pluto's lives, Ive red of a feller of
                  the name of Arestidees, who was banishd bekase peeple was tired of heerin him
                  crackt up for his honesty. Possably the Seckatry of War's feller citysins is tired
                  of heerin him crackt up for his energee and cetery, who nose? Arestidees was tride
                  by ginral eleckshin with oyster shells for ballots, and the verdick was
                  "skedaddle", witch he dun. I wunder wether Seckatry Stanton wouldn't be shelled
                  out of the kentry ef he was put to vote in the same way.
               To-morrer, or prehaps this arternoon, we shall start for Harrassin Bar, and
                  eggspeck to be harrasst by the rebels on our retreat, but we shall keep along the
                  bank of the river, pairtly onder the proteckshin of our gunboats, and the
                  commandin ginral thinks that if we air attact we ken hold our own. Yesterday
                  arternoon we gin em fits at this pint, drivin em like sheep and takin a hull raff
                  of em prisners. Sum say Ginral Magruder is among em, but I hevent seen him yet. As
                  you air awar, I cum thunderin near baggin him wunst myself, but his drunken
                     luck saved him. Hopin we shell sun
                  receeve re-enforcements, and be agen, in a condishin for a forrard moovment, I
                  remain, sincerelty but savagely,
               
                  Yours allus,

                  HARRASSIN BAR, JAMES RIVER, July 9, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Considerin the way this army was pitcht inter doorin the late ripstavin fights, it
                  recooperates amazin rapid. Bein posted on risin ground, we air abuv the reach of
                  myasmatic inflewences. In the onhelthy wilderness from witch we hev eskaped, the
                  men sufferd with agar, for it rekwired the constistooshin of the hoss to stand the
                  moreasses; but in our present cool and deliteful summer retreat, the sick and
                  wownded is progressin favorably, and I larn from the docters that thars but few
                  deths from deceases of the liver. Prehaps this is owin, in part, to change of
                  treatment, as no blue pills hes ben adminstered to the troops for sum days past.
                  Nothwithstandin our losses, it was well we dug out when we did, from the swomps
                  beyont Gains' Mill, utherways ninetents of us mought hev found our graves
                  thar.
               Cullerd refewgeese from the rebel camp represents that thousands of thar sojers
                  was thrown inter a state of halloosinashin by the gunpowder cocktails with witch
                  they refresht tharselves doorin the recent cumbats. It peers that a kwart of
                  red-eye stiffened with hafe a pound of powder, was sarved out to each vetran, and
                  a dubble doste to the new conskrips, evry day doorin the struggel. In coarse the
                  solushin of rot-gut and saltpeter kept em continally corned, witch ackounts for
                  thar makin a salt arter a salt with the vigger of fresh troops, when we sposed all
                  the grit hed ben taken outer em. But last week, arter the final acshin, reachsin
                  commenst, and setch a bellerin and rorin as thar was in the seecesh ranks (ef the
                  fudgetives is to be bleved) was never heerd afore outside of an insanitory
                  institooshin. They all sposed, as if ushally the case in many a
                     potyous, as the Grate Incinderary was in pershoot of em with a red hot
                  poker and bein awar that the contents of thar stummickss was highly cumbustabul
                  and extree-hazardus, they naterally dredded to cum in contract with setch a
                  weepin. Accordin to the contrabands, sum fansid they was bumshells, and puttin
                  thar tungs out, rekwested thar cumraids to eggstingwish the fuse. It seems
                  tharfore that altho gunpowder punch may be an all-feroshus fightin beveridge, yet
                  ef a man takes it till he gets shot in the neck, it is liabul to play the devil
                  with him.
               Our lines eggstend from jest belo Harrassin Landin about seven milds up streem,
                  and the current report is, that we air to remain on the banks of the river ontil
                  the new levees is razed and drilled, and we ken advance with the sartainty of
                  overwelmin the insirgents. In the meantime, re-enforcements is reachin us in
                  transports, and the hull army is as happy as Irishmen at a wake. The rashins is
                  bully, as plenty of fresh beef cums up from the Fort evry day. Consekens is, we
                  air all galinin flesh. On the march from the Chickenhominy, we hed nothin but the
                  hardest kinder crackers, and its a wunder we dident fizzle out on setch repulsive
                  fare. More'n five hunderd contrabands is now emploid in the cookin department, and
                  no one complains that animal food is meated out with a niggerd hand. The
                  opertoonity to bathe is also a fine thing for the men, and hunderds of em may be
                  seen cuttin up thar jimnasticks in the James, at all hours of the day.
               In short we all feel in boyant sperrits, and sink or swimn, sirvive or perish, we
                  are reddy to strike out wunst more for Richmound at the word go. We could drive
                  the rebels like deers ef we oney hed Fort Darling. The plan is for the gunboats to
                  git a brest of it while we open on its rare with our breeching pieces, but this
                  kant be dun without a bigger force than the Girnral now hes at his disposhal. When
                  Darling yields to our arms, a few powerful rams will sun clar the channel from
                  piles and uther obstruckshins, and the strong hold of Virginny will be ours.
                  Howsever its idol to count chickens afore thar hatched, as I confess I did when we
                  began to shell the rebels on the Chickenhominy. I crowed a leetle might too kwick,
                  thats a fack.
               Nuthin ken be luvlyer'n our present elevated lowcashin. The gentle slopes over
                  witch we lately retreated is a perfeck panorammer of pictoresk buty, altho in
                  menny places the rebel corn hes sufferd from the tramplin feet of our sojers.
                  Feeld larks sings in the meddows all day long, and all throo these moonlight
                  nights the encurridging notes of the "whip-her-well" seems to foretell the cumming
                  fate of the Suthern Cornfedracy.
               
               On Toosday evenin last the hull army was thrownm inter convulshins of delight by
                  the suddent apperience of the President. He is in fine helth and sperrits and is
                  heving a tall time, holding revews and treting us all to a perfeck few de
                     joy of cannondrums.
               This mornin he axed me why he resembeld Ginral Maclellin. As he meshurs, six feet
                  five in his stockin feet and our glorlus little Mac is oney five feet six with his
                  boots on, I couldn't see it, but he immediently releved me from the angwish of
                  suspense, by statin that it was bekase he hed jest left the White House for James
                  River. Seein he was in the humerus vain, I gin him the follerin: ses I "Why is the
                  Seekatry of War like a lame letter carryer?" He couldn't wool it, so I hed to
                  eggsplain to him that the Seckatry of War was like a lame letter carryer, on
                  ackount of not bein the right Man for the Post. He wouldn't see it, but I told him
                  the peeple did. Arter remainin silent for a few moments, doorin wich I persoom he
                  was turnin the Seckatry over in his mind, the ushil pleasant twinkle cum back to
                  his eyes, and he inkwired ef I could tell him wot to do with Freemount. "My
                  venabul frend," ses I, "ef you want to do the clean thing, and wash your hands of

                  Mountings, witch he ses he diskivered, and send Kit Carson with him to show him
                  whar it is." That fotched him—he larfed till he kwivered all over like a bean-pole
                  in a thunder-gust, and remarkt, that ef the Pathfinder would strike a bee line for
                  ennywhars outer sight, he wouldent mind treatin him to a coach and four, witch he
                  onderstood was his favrit travellin eckwipedge and re-instatin old Saygoney as his
                  a decamp.
               Arter an hour or so's conversashin of a similder improovin carrickter, we pairted
                  with resiprical eggspreshuns of affeckshin and regaird. He will leve for
                  Washington this evenin or tomorrer, and we shell all be sorry to hev him go.
                  Honest Old Abe! he desarves the name. As a paytryit, he cums up to my standard.
                  Long may he wave!
               As the strait jacket rools of the War Department prevents me from sendin you enny
                  informashin of importance, I must refer you to the Richmound papers for all the
                  perticklers witch it is desirabul should be kept sekrit from the rebels, and hopin
                  that a time may cum when all gag-laws will, be repealed, I remain with sincere
                  contempt for offishal humbugs;

                  HARRASSIN BAR, July 17, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Seecesh, arter flutterin around for a fortnight as ef he calkilated to make a dart
                  hes withdrord to his old roostin place in the neybrood of Richmound. Ginral Lee
                  findlin it onpossabul to haul the grub for his amens army throo the swomps,
                  conclooded to fall back to his hog and homany, and now now I spose, things will
                  remain in wot pollytishins calls a state of "masterly inactivity" ontil we get
                  re-enforcements enuff to risk another shindy. Whether that blessed consummerashin
                  will take place alfore the fall, or then, or when, is an open kwestin, or rayther
                  an open and shet kwestin, witch I leve to the pollytickle profits, for its
                  atltogether beyant me. Mebbe the Seckatry of War nose when sumthin that
                     means sumthin is likely to be dun; but its my bleef that the fog
                  as sirrounds the hall matter is thicker in the visinity of the War Offis than
                  ennywhars else wonder the canopy. The poick ses "thaur is a Providence as shapes
                  our eends"; but it peers to me that our eend is shaped by the agents of the uther
                  feller, and it wont be long afore its whittled down to a pint of it continnees in
                  setch infarnal bad hands.
               The sojers of this army isent fools. They ken dror an inference as well as dror a
                  bead, and when they see by the papers as the cussed pollytishins is dishartnin the
                  people and stoppin recrutin with thar misabul quarls, they feel as of a few rounds
                  of grape drapt inter thar ranks, without distinkshin of party, would be eenamost
                  ekwil to a Union victory in the feeld. The South is chucklin over the dispute's of
                  your torkin traitors in the North. Thars nuthin seecesh likes better'n to see
                  radicals and consarvatives buttin wun atnuther like two flocks Of billy-gotes,
                  insted of layin thar heds together and clubbin all thar energees for the porpus of
                  strikin a decisive blo at the rebellyun. Why in thunder kant the slangwangs on
                  both sides hold up till the fight's over? Not wun of the kwestins as agitates thar
                  pettifoggy in minds ken be settled ontil the South's whipt. That's the bizness on
                  hand now, anrd thars oney wun way to finnish it up, and thats by the sledge-hammer
                  argyment of sooperiur force. Ef I hed absloot power for about a month, Ide draft
                  evry purfeshinal pollytishin lytishin
                  inter the army, and put em to work as team-drivers and trumpet-blowers—its about
                  all theyre fit for. The flower of the United States Sennit mought prehaps be
                  usefully emploid in the new army bakeries, and sum of the blud-and-thunder fellers
                  of the House of Representatives mought be set to butcherin beef for the Army of
                  the Potomac.
               As Eddyturs is noways responsabul for curryspondent's subjestins, prehaps youll
                  allow me to prepose that Chandler, the paytriotic Midgygander, who hes ben
                  follerin up the rebel attact on Ginral Maclellin by assailin him in the rare from
                  a saift place in the Sennit chamber, may be made chief of balloons to this
                  divishin, as his nateral taste for gas would no doubt render him a first-rate
                  airynaught; and he mought take Freemount with him as an assistant to pill the
                  valves. Freemount resined his cummand in the presents of the enemees of his
                  kentry, and Mister Chandler went a leetle furder, by pitchin inter Ginral
                  Maclellin, jest arter he hed repulst em. Two setch conjenal sperrits would be
                  kwite to hum together in the clouds, and ef they should never cum down I ken oney
                  say that better men hev disappeard senst the time of Elijah. Ef the Seckatry of
                  War wants the right man in the right place, let him by all means puts his frend
                  Chandler at the head of the gasbag department, and send him up, with the
                  Pathfinder, to take a birds eye view of the Conduck of the War. Should the wind be
                  in the direckshin of Richmound, thar would be no harm in cuttin the balloon cord,
                  so as to make it smooth sailin for em to the rebel capital. Its easier to go thar
                  by gas than enny uther way.
               While the North is beatin up recrutes to enabul us to beat the rebels, we air
                  takin it easy on the banks of the James. Whisky is perhibited eggsept as a medsin;
                  but as the number of sick is large and the sutlers supply the well, few suffers
                  from the use of onholsom water. Thars very good fishin jest below the Bar, but it
                  ken oney be enjide from the decks of the gunboats, as the seecesh fires inter all
                  unarmed craft from a mud scow to a horspittle ship. I tride for sum rock fish
                  tuther day, but hed hardly ankerd and bated my line afore a minnie ball smasht wun
                  of my skulls, and a four pound shot went throo my starn and cum allfrightful near
                  sinkin me. Sport's sport, and Ime naterally brave as well as fond of anglin, but
                  if ever lively paddlin was dun by a white man, it was in that emergingsee. The
                  prencepul amewsment of the men is poker and old sledge, tossin coppers, crack
                  loo—a streek in the sand sarving for the crack—and checkers. The offsirs
                  discurridge gamblin as in dooty bound; and setch of the chaplins as doosent take a
                  hand tharselves pints out the conneckshin atween bettin and Belzybub; but wots the
                  use? The sojers pockets the papers and tetches thar caps outer respect to thar
                  offsirs when they go by, and two minits arterwards theyre at it agin regairdless
                  of thar immortal soles. Its astonishin, considering the number of relidgus
                  pamflits thars ben distribited to this army, that it doosent no better; but I
                  spose the resin is that the misabul sinners use the tracks to fold up thar small
                  stores, insted of layin em to hart and feedin on the bred of life they contane.
                  Strange to say, however, skores and hunderds of em hes Bibles, and I wouldent be
                  sprised ef they found thar way to Hevin, poor blunderin critters, ennamost as well
                  as ef they was allus turnin up the whites of thar eyes and groanin onder the
                  effecks of a secktarian colic.
               I onderstand thars a report goin the rounds at Washington that the rebels tuck
                  cannon enuff from this army to plate Fort Darlin eighteen inches thick, and that
                  the Treadagur iron works is meltin em down for that porpuss. The same relieabul
                  and conshyenshus parties as stated as the White House would make a fust rate
                  horspittle for five hunderd payshents, is sposed to be at the bottom of this
                  ironwar story. Thars enny kwantity of talent for eggsitin fickshin atwixt the
                  Capitol Hill and Georgetown Hights, and nowhars doos it seem to flurrish so
                  lucksewerusly as in the plesent shadder of the War Department. The Seckatry of War
                  hisself is remarkabul for his poetick biass, so much so in fack that the
                  tellegraft onder his control hes ben ekwil to a lyre with a thousand strings.
               Hopin as the printers will make no mistake about the spellin of the last wurd but
                  four in the preseedin sentens, I remain, awaitin the march of events, but not
                  expectin em to moove afore the Fall,

                     has been sick of the fever, and although convalescent, is still suffering from

                     him during his delirium. The ravings

                  HARRASSIN LANDIN, August 7, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Wen conjestive fever gits hold of a feller its no joke. It nox you down and sets
                  onto you like an inkabus, forbiddin the use of the pen. I speak by the keard, for
                  senst my last Ive hed a life-or-deth-rastle with this bog-bear of the South, and
                  cum all-blazin near gettin the coo de grass. Hed I ben tuck
                  with it in the Pawmonkey Swomp, no dout I should hev got my everlastin furlow, but
                  this high ground is more faverabul to valleytoodinarians, and tho mutch broken, I
                  am gradjelly mendin. At wun time my mind wanderd to that degree that the doctors
                  considered me a goner, but thars a Providence as shapes our eends, and mine warn't
                  shaped, it seems. Consekently, here I am settin up on my cot in the sick shanty,
                  with a swimmin in my hed and an orful sinkin at my stummick, tryin to get sumthin
                  lively throo my har for the collumes of the Merkary. You musn't andizzypate
                  ennything, very brilyant, howsever, for I feel as ef my upperwurks was whizzing,
                  and jerkin, and snappin, like a Yankee clock outer gearin.
               Its extrornary wot strange things the most sensabul man may say wen laborin onder
                  the helloocynashins of delirum. Ef the fattest offis in the gift of the guverment
                  was offerd by advertisement to the purest paytryits, I don't bleve a truer friend
                  of the Union than I be could be skared up atwixt the fedral city and Funnel Haul;
                  and yet I larn that when the fever was on, me I acktilly blastfeemed the
                  administrashin and even spoke in disporridgement of that Playdum of our Libties,
                  the mighty wurrier and statesman of Illanoy. Ef it hedent a ben that the cumraid
                  as nust me tuck down my raven words in black and white, to reed to me wen I got
                  well, I wouldn't hev sposed it possabul that setch langwedge could hev passed the
                  lyal lips of your curryspondent. But when a man's not in a sanitory state of mind
                  in coarse he isent responsabul for his railin wurds, and noboddy don't oughter
                  take a fence at him.
               It peers I thort I hed the President and sum of his constitooshinal advisers caged
                  in a carryvan and was totin em throo the North, for a sho. My nuss ses I addrest
                  the imadginary awjinces as follers:
               This feller citysins (pintin inter vacancy) is Abraham Lincoln, President of the
                  United States, called for shortness, and bekase, he was never addickted to petty
                  larceny, Honest Abe. He's an astonishing man at axin chesnut trees and
                  cannondrums, and ken split rails or sides with equil cumplaysensy. Mr. Lincoln, my
                  poplar frend, be kind enuff to favor this enlightened awjence with a
                  button-buster. He wishes to no, ladies and gentlemen, why his boot is like an
                  ainshent Greek republick? I dessay youll never guess, for it lucks considabul more
                  like the kingdom of Italy, a few sizes less than life. He eggsplains. His boot is
                  like an ainshent Greek republick bekase it has a Sole on. Prehaps the answer is
                  obskewer. Agen he will eggsplain: Solon was a wise man of antickity, but at the
                  present day Solan geese may be found in Greenland. You see his nollidge is
                  univarsal. Ef time permitted, he would be reminded of a story, but unfortnitly he
                  hes to be returnt to the seat of guverment before the commensment of the Fall
                  camppain. Observe, his eye twinkles—he hes an idee. Wot is it, your eggsellency?
                  He wishes me to state to this intelleckshal assemblidge witch I considder the most
                  wunaderful of all his stories. It's onpossible—thars setch an innoomerable number
                  on em, and theyre all so mutch alike. Wunst more he eggsplains: The most wunderful
                  of all his stories, is his uppers story. Thars no repressin his humor, you
                  perceeve; it spurts outer him like patroleum from the mouth of a Pennsylvania ile
                  well. His waggish tales would make a dorg larf, and its a pity thars not time to
                  git em off. Mebbe you would like to larn why this cherful citysin was eleckted to
                  the Eggseggative Cheer. For variety, ladies and gentlemen, for variety. All our
                  prevus cheef madgistrets led ben grave and dignified, and we wanted a rib-tickler
                  I spose. We've got wun, ennyhow. Like the man in the drayma, he peers to think as
                  all the world's a stage, and he wants to star it as a low commedian. He preposes
                  to save the Union on jocular prenceples; but I'me afeerd the larf wont cum in at
                  present. In the meantime, howsoever, it is a consolashin to know that wotever
                  disasters may overtake the nashin, the White House will allus be a merry as a
                  circus. The President nods and winks in the affirmative, and would offer a closin
                  remark. He says that care killed a cat, but never averted a catastrophy; and that
                  even the solem old Roman Emprors, wen they went to the sennit, had a set of
                  fellers called lickters, that carrid thar farces before em. You ken set down now,
                  Mr. President, wile I stir up the Seckatry of War.
               This, ladies and gentlemen (settin up the cot bolster) is the head of the War
                  Department. Wot he doosent no about milentary tary strutegy and setch, all the ginrals in the
                  wurld kant teetch him. He is an inch taller than the fust Napollyun, and
                  considabully heavyer. You air awar wot the results of the conflick hes ben so far.
                  Well we owe evrything—incloodin the masterly back down in the Shunadoor Valley—to
                  this extrornary critter. Hip! hip! hip! hurrah! Why in thunder don't you cheer?
                  Youve heern, prehaps, that him and Ginral Maclellin doosent set up thar horses
                  together. But I hev it from the Playdum of our Libties, in the nex cage, that
                  Ginral Maclellin lucks upon the Honabul Seckatry with much affeckshin, and
                     vicey versey. Take him altogether, the Seckatry of War is
                  the biggest thing out in the milentary line, and ennybody that kwestins his
                  capassity for war and conkest will be immediently supprest as a dumestic
                  traitor.
               Setch was the style in witch I raved, as I onderstand, for more'n twenty-four
                  hours, wile the loonatic fit was onto me. Chase, Welles, and Seward cum in for
                  considabul abuse; but it seems I pitcht hardest inter Honest Old Abe and Seckatry
                  Stanton, two men as I equelly luv and esteem wen in the perseshin of my senses.
                  But ef a fellers outer his hed, just wot he don't want to say, and dont oughter
                  say, is wot he invariably doos say.
               Thars a counsel of war among the leadin offsirs to-day, and the rummer is that a
                  push is to be made at wunst for Richmound; but, on the uther hand, dont be sprised
                  ef you heer of a rebel push for Washington in less'n ten days from now. Thars

                  HARRASSIN LANDIN, August 14, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The army of the Peninsular hes rekivered from the hard batting it reseved in
                  changin its base, and is impayshint to hev the ball agin set in moshin. For sum
                  time past it hes ben devotin its energees to ketchin flees and ticks, smudgin
                  galley nippers, and subjugatin sartin lice-senshus insecks as prays upon the human
                  cuetickle. While the troops hes ben engaged in this silent but bluddy struggel
                  with enemees at wunst penetratin and circumspecked, Porter's Mortar Flowtiller hes
                  ben lyin at Hamton Roads in a state of masterly inactivity. Doorin the same
                  intrim, thea gunboat squadrun hes ben mored in James River, dooin nuthin jest as
                  eesy as rollin off a log.
               But thars gwine to be a movement at last, and prehaps you'll hear on it by
                  tellagraft afore this reeches you. In course it will be conduckted with the ushil
                  address, but the direckshin is kept a perfound secrit for the present. With the
                  eggsepshin of the Guverment, our ginrals, and the rebels, few hes enny idee of the
                  supprise that awaits the enemee. I hope I vilate no confidense in sayin that we
                  air not to advance and captivate Richmound—kwite the contrairy. The fack is that
                  the sickly seesin is cumming on, and the army is gwine to make a grand strutegic
                  slantendicaler slide for the bennyfit of its helth. Hunderds of our best hosses is
                  dyin of intestinal disorders, and the overfed buzzards bein too fat and lazy to
                  keer about hoss flesh, the aromer of discomposin carryon is onhelthily loud. The
                  doctors ses if the army stays here the men will fowler the bosses. Consekently we
                  air about to start in pershoot of that health and happiness which the Declarashin
                  of Independents grantease to evry citysin. The American Constitooshin is naterally
                  rayther weak, and it would be madness to risk the lives of the champions of the
                  Union in a struggle with the Suthern pestilence. Takin all these things inter
                  considerashin, the Peninslu is to be evackiated afore diaree sets in.
               I dunno as I oughter rit that last sentens, but the cat's shoor to be outer the
                  bag by the time this letter gits inter your hands. The kwestin is, howsever, not
                  whar we air gwine from, but whar we air gwine too. All I
                  ken ventur to say on the subjeck is that we eggspeck to effeck a junkshin with
                  sumboddy sumwhars, for sum purpos, if we don't in the meantime run agin a
                  snag.
               So eends our gloryus six-munts camppain in these diggins. The grand army of the
                  Potomac, that was to take "no step backards", arter being licked hafe a duzzen
                  times on this insignificant tung of land, is now necessiated, in spite of its
                  teeth, to make a rutdegrade moovement. Whars that sevagrus reptyle, the grate
                  milentary bore constructor, that everyboddy was makin setch a coil about in April
                  and May? It hes ben weighed in the
                  sales and found wanting. It hes ben completely headed off and its tail is tolled.
                  Braver men and better sojers than the host as started on the root to Richmound
                  last March never drord a bead or fixed a bagnet. But how hey they ben engineerd?
                  Shuvvels and wheelbarrows hes ben the order of the day. They hev remainder is
                  about to make a skientific sedaddle to parts unbeknown. I wunst read a buck they
                  called the "Histry of the Croosades", whar it was stated that the fust army that
                  started for Jerooslum superstishusly follered the movements of Goose. As mought
                  hey ben eggspected they all perisht of starvashin in the swomps of Hungry. Thars a
                  morial in the story witch I reckymend to the solemn considerashin of the Solomons
                  at Washington.
               Ime glad, however, that we air likely to quit these moreasses. Enny moove from our
                  present icelated persishin to a cooler, helthier rejin, cant be in the rong
                  direckshin. In a munt, I spose, we shall hev three hunderd thousand new recrtes in
                  the feeld, and with such an addishenal force, onless its manovered by a seckind
                  edishin of the giant Blunderbore, we ken sartinly giv Ginral Lee and his
                  assoshiates thar quietus.
               Thars wun thing in the conduck of this war witch must pervoke the admirashin of
                  the hull civilized wurld, and that is the screwpullus perliteness and
                  distinguished considerashin with witch we treat the bullyin blaggards in command
                  of the seecesh armies. Ginral Lee writes to Ginral Halleck that he lucks upon sum
                  of our Major Ginrals and Bragadears as robers, cutthroats, murderers and pirits,
                  and menshins the names of a few that he means to hang when he ketches them. To
                  this Ginral Hallecock replies that as sketch langwidge is insultin to the
                  government of the United States, he respeckfuly declines to receive
                  it. The idee of respeckfully declining the insults of a blustering
                  traitor peers to me to be the height of human curtsey, and desarves to be recorded
                  in Histry as a tip-top specement of perlite litteratoor in the Nineteent Sentry.
                  But Ginral Maclellin is ekwilly considerit, ef not more so. While the rebels amuse
                  tharselves with setch practickle jokes as cuttin the throtes of unarmed Unionists,
                  and hangin em heels uppards, with thar entrals in thar mouths (I sor with my own
                  eyes the boddies of two lyal citysins as hed been sarved in this way, near the
                  White House), Ginral Maclellin tells his army that as this is "not a war of
                  subjugashin" it must be conducted "upon the highest prenceples known to Christian
                  civilizashin." Not a war of subjugashin! What in the name of chain-lightnin is it
                  then? To subjugate, my old dickshinary ses, is "to compel to submit". Don't we
                  want to compel the South to submit? Ef not, spose we throw down our arms and ax
                  thar pardon for heving pitcht inter em contrary "to the highest prenceples of
                  Christian civilizashin".
               Beleven that when a nashin drors the swoord, it should never dror it mild, and
                  that the old Testyment noshin of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is the
                  troo wun for a war like ours, I remain, with extreem ferosity,

                  [The rebels are in great force on the line of the Virginia Central Railroad,
                     and also on the south bank of the Rapidan, threatening General Pope's army and
                     Fredericksburg. We hope Pope, Burnside, and McClellan are near enough to each
                     other to form a speedy junction. Probably the first blow will fall on
                     Pope.—EDS.]
               
               
                  YORKTOWN, August 20, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The grand advance to the rare witch I hinted at in my last epistol is accomplisht.
                  We hev eskaped triumfantly, without a scratch. When it is rememberd that it tuck
                  the Army of the Potomack sixteen munts to make its way up the Peninslur, and oney
                  forty-eight hours to return, the human mind relizes with amazement the rapid
                  strides that hes ben made in milentary sience senst the commensment of this
                  majestickle struggle. It is onnessary to giv the particklars of our sole-refreshin
                  trip from Harrassin Landin to Yorktown. We left the plesent waterin-place whar we
                  hed ben so long reposin on our lorils about day-brake on Friday, the fifteent
                  instant, and arrove here on Sunday arternoon, singin sams of victry. The rebels,
                  bein engaged in uther persoots, sufferd us to vamose without firin a shot.
                  Opinyins differs, howsever, as to the resin we warnt mislested on the march. Sum
                  thinks that as the mane objeck of the Seecesh hes all along ben to get us off the Peninslur, they
                  porpusly left the coste clar for the performence of this brillyant peace of
                  warlike strutegy. That porshin of the army as went in transports to Fortress Munro
                  happily arrove saift, with the artillry, stores, and cetry, so that nuthin to
                  speak of hes fallen inter the hands of the discumforted fo, barrin the territory,
                  witch we hev ockypied doorin the summer as a milentary cematery.
               So mutch for the late brillyant manover. Of the moovments now in contemplashin I
                  must speak cawslusly. Consentrashin is the idee for the ensooin camppain.
                  Maclellin, Burnside, and Pope is edgin up to wun anuther, and by the time this
                  reeches you they oughter all be within sportin distans. And not a bit too sun
                  nuther, for, as I told you three weeks ago, the rebels is goin to make a desput
                  push for Washington. Thar hull army in the Southwest, it is sed, hes ben orderd to
                  jine Ginral Lee, and all thar troops in frunt of Richmound is now moovin tords the
                  Deestrick of Columby. Thar'll be a bluddy fite within ten days from this date, and
                  I trust and bleve a Union victry. By that time we oughter hev 350,000 troops in
                  Virginny, and onless they air mismanaged most orfully, Seecesh will hev to holler
                  and run.
               Oney let our milentary leaders abandun strutegy and pitch right in, and we ken
                  smash em. All Ime afeard on is, complicated plans and intrickit skeems. The
                  scientific dodge game is playd out. Shot and shell, bullet and bagnet, fire and
                  swoord, is to settle this bizness. It ken be finisht up no uther way. We must fite
                  the rebels day in and day out. It wont do to giv em a back fall, and then wait for
                  em to rekiver thar wind for anuther rastle. Wen we've got em down we must stomp
                  onto em, and never kwit jumpin on thar carcusses ontil they cease to sho enny
                  sines of life.
               In coarse this stile of warfare will seem dredful crewel to sum. I hev a
                  broad-brimmed unkel belongin to the Sosity of Frends as would call it barbarus.
                  Wal, war is barbarus. The prencepal is to "kill, kill, kill," as the mad king ses
                  in the drayma.
               Purty sun we shell outnumber the rebels two to wun. In bone and mussel the Nuthern
                  troops is sooperior to the Suthern, and in pluck fully thar ekwils. Evrything
                  depends on the way our men is handeld.
               The Stars and Stripes will wave over Jeff Davis's head-kwarters in Richmound afore
                  the middle of October, ef our ginrals will oney fite insted of fendin off.
               Knowin that onless they ken gain a big victry afore our new army gits inter the
                  feeld, they air gon, bob and sinker, Lee and his assoshits will make a tremenjus
                  rush for the fedral capital with all the forces they ken muster, right away. Ef
                  they ketch Pope, Burnside, or Macllellin onsupported, its not onlikely that the
                  divishin cort nappin will git an ongodly beltin; but ef the three divishins closes
                  up and givs battle to the Cornfedrits, they'll be whipt jest as sartain as Floyd's
                  a theef and Magruder's a drunkard. The simperthisers in Washington allow that
                  thar'll be four hunderd thousand Seecesh onder arms in the Old Dominion afore the
                  fust of September. Gas and gammon! All thar troops in the feeld from wun
                  eggstremity of Seeceshy to the uther, incloodin gorillas, doosent amount to more'n
                  that number, and they hevent 175,000 sojers in the State of Virginny to-day.
               No reliance whatsumdever is to be placed on the stories of noosepaper
                  curryspondents about the rebel force in these rejins. It was stated at fust by sum
                  of these gesswurk humbugs that Stunwall Jackson hed sixty thousand men when he
                  attacted Ginral Pope's advance; then they put the number down to thirty thousand,
                  and, finerly, to fifteen thousand. The truth is, he hed barly six thousand!
               Its my firm bleef that thars as menny Union as thars rebel troops in Virginny, and
                  that all our ginrals hev to do is to mass thar divishins together, and sail in to
                  sartain victry.
               As to rebel re-enforcements from the Southwest, who keers for that. Doosent our
                  new recruits pore in from the North faster'n they ken send troops from
                  Chatternogo? Let em bring thar hull Southwestern army on here ef they dar. Buell
                  and Curtis ken then ockapy all thar posishins in that kwarter, while we punish em
                  here.
               But all depends, as I sed afore, upon our ginrals. Ef they don't sho tharselves in
                  airnest—ef they play the old shilly-shally shuvvel and wheelburrow game—ef they
                  don't make it war to the knife, and the knife to the hilt—tell evry rebel now in
                  arms is ether slorterd, or captivated, or flyin for life—then the games up on our
                  side.
               Hopin, blevin, prayin, and eggspectin, that we shell lick rebellyon, and that
                  rebellyun will lick the dust, I remane, swoord in hand and pistil cockt for mortal
                  cumbat,

                  ACQUIA CRICK, August 26, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               In imitashin of the Rushin Milentary Desputism doorin the Crymean War, the
                  Guverment at Washington hes issood an order directin all noosepaper curryspondents
                  to be druv outer our armees in Virginia, vi et am us, as the
                  skollards say. In our case the order is not called a Ukase as
                  it was in Rushy, but in all sensual perticklers the two cases is fack
                     semeles. I hev not seen a copy of the dockyment, but the currier who
                  brort it ses the langwidge is perrumptory, and rekwires the offsirs to boot us out
                  of the lines to the enliven toon of the Roag's March, and to hang us as spies if
                  we attemp to return.
               He states, also, that to prevent the possability of enny more tales bein told
                  outer skull, all the ink, pens, and paper belongin to privit sojers and offsirs
                  below the rank of bragadears, is to be placed wonder the keer of a speshil gard,
                  composed of men who ken nuther reed nor rite, and that the hull army is to sho
                  thar hands twyst a day, at "revelee" and "taps", and ef enny sojer is deteckted
                  with an ink spot on his fingers he is to be immediently wiped out, and his
                  property, if he happens to hey enny, confisticated for the use of the Gaverment

               I hev hed an intervew with Ginral Maclellin senst the rival of the currier, and he
                  hes takin the responsbility of allowin me to pen this epistol, and I shell this
                  arternoon address anuther to my magnannymous frend the President, who I feel
                  sartain will make an eggsepshin in my faver for old ackwaintance sake, and bekase
                  I hev allus rendered that triboot to his genus for dublin tenders, callembores,
                  and uther button-busters, witch they so richly desarved. I think, tharfore (to use
                  the wurds of the late C. C. Cambrelling), that I shall be abel to continny this
                  curryspondence "in spite of lamentashins here and allswear".
               But it will, go rayther hard with less faverd paper-stainers, who hev vilated thar
                  payroll of honor not to contradick the tellagraffic ackounts of Union victries,
                  and who hevent hed enuff common sense and sense of the ridickalus to crack up the
                  side-splittin joaks emanatin from the head of the republick. I lamn with
                  regret—but without suprise—that the curryspondents of the New York Herald,
                  Triboon, Times, Eggspress, Post, Commershil, and Wilkes's Sperrit of the Times, is
                  to be drummed outer camp doorin arternoon parade to-morrow. Each of these littery
                  delinkwents is to ware a foolscap made of the jernil he represents, and it is
                  speshily ordered, I onderstand, that the headdress of the curryspondent of
                  Wilkes's Sperrit is to consist of the copy of the sourcaustic paper witch contains
                  a byagruffical sketch of Ginral Maclellin, by the leaden eddytur. The hull
                  spectickle will be solem and imposin, but I don't think it will hev the effeck of
                  preventin "letters from the seat of war" from appearin in the noosepapers, bekase
                  curryspondence kwite as traffic and interestin and ackarit as enny that hes yet
                  appeared, ken be got up in the back offises of the jernils referd to, at the small
                  expense of say ten dollars a week apeace, and I think the Eggspress—witch hes a
                  remarkabul turn for ekonimy—ken do it for five. Takin all things inter
                  considerashin I think the inflew enshil organs of public opinyun in the Empire
                  City will save considabul by hevin all thar war letters rit to hum. "Relieabul
                  gentmen" ken be hed at most enny price in New York, and hum made intelligence from
                  our armies in the field will hev the dubble advantidge of bein ekwilly cheap and
                  orthentic. That it will be as trustwurthy as the guverment tellagrams, noboddy as
                  nose ennything about the morril depravity of artifishal lightnin, will for a
                  moment dout.
               The vidgelance of the War Department in suddenly shetting down on the
                  curryspondens of the lyall noosepapers in the North is most pertickerly to be
                  commended at this time, when a slyte oversight on the part of sumbuddy, but for
                  witch noboddy is to blame, hes throne all the milentary plans of the guverment
                  inter the hands of the rebels. The privit despatches, et cetery, et cetery, of
                  Ginrals Pope and Macdoill, sezed tutler day by the Seecesh Kernil Stewart at
                  Catlet's Stashin, is sposed to hev contaned more strutegy and setch, then was ever
                  afore tied together with red tape senst
                  the wurld began. The Annie Condy plan warnt nuthin to it, Ime told. And now that
                  contemtabul cornfedrit conspurrator, Jeff Davis, is reedin over the manyskrips,
                  and studyin the combinashins as was to hev eggstingwished him and hisn, at his
                  leeshur. Hed them captered plans oney ben carrid out, insted of bein tuck from us
                  in an ongarded moment, by a passel of scooting troopers, who hedent even the
                  perliteness to say by your leve, the fate of the rebellyun would hev ben sealed.
                  Now its onsealed, and thars no tellin when it will be brort to a close.
               Ginral Maclellin arrove at these head-kwarters on Sunday mornin, and arterwards
                  Ginral Burnside cum in from the Rapperhammock to tork over matters with the
                  galliant chief. It is rummerd that Ginral Pope and Ginral Maclellin doosent hitch
                  bosses together, both claimin the cheef cummand. The report is that Ginral Halleck
                  hes ben appeald to, and will settle the diffikulty by becummin cock-of-the-walk
                  hisself. Stanton seems to hev sobsided senst Halleck tuck the rains of pour, as
                  Ginralissimo. The result of the Shunadoor Valley splurge setteld his milentary
                  stummack sum, and he seems to hev rapt hisself up in the solitood of his own
                  oridginality, and sot down to solid thinkin. I hop sumthin 'll cum of it. Holesum
                  refleckshun dizzyplins the mind and tends to perdooce resignashin.
               Fresh troops from the North, rayther raw, but as plucky as game chickens, is
                  arriving continally, and purty sun we shell hev four hundred thousand men on the
                  line of the Potomac, the Rapid Ann, and the Rapperhammock. Pope is in advance,
                  with Burnside and his Peninslur boys lyen behind him, and on his right, and the fo
                  is on the uther side of the Rapperhammock waitin for the river to fall to go in.
                  Ef it hedent a ben for the risen of the waters, a bluddy encounter would hev cum
                  off last week, and its oney postponied tell the bilen torrent simmers down and
                  parshilly dries up. In the meantime thars plenty of skrimmidging in frunt, and
                  Pope hes tuck, altogether, about a thousand prisners, and mought be considerd as
                  dooin remarkably well ef he hedent lost his plans and despatches.
               Thars a report in our lines to-night that the Seecesh Ginral Ewell has been wiped
                  out by Captin Lacy in a fight at Barnett's Ford, about twenty miles from
                  Fredericksburg. I send you the story for wot its worth, witch is probly about the
                  vally of a three cent stomp arter its ben throo the mail.
               Hopin that we may sun meet the rebels with a sooperiur force on our side, and

                  ALEXANDRY, September 3, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               I hev jest cum over here from Washington, whar, for the last three days, I hev ben
                  actin as a naid to the surgin-ginral and his staff, who hes ben overheadandears in
                  surgycall bizness, in consekens of the continnal pourin in of the wownded ever
                  senst the retreat from Bull Run to Centreveal. Pope is fallin back at a purty
                  actyve pace, and it seems from the hevvy skrinmmidge near Fairfacts Court-House on
                  Munday night that a considabul outlyin boddy of the enemees troops was then
                  closter to Washington than he was. Sum thinks they'll be ketched in a snair;
                  uthers allows as Pope will be attacted in frunt by Lee, while Jackson bumbards his
                  rare, and that atween the two his numerus tiles will be held as in a vice; but I
                  trust it will prove vicey-versy. The seecesh universally pretends to take the
                  latter vew of the case; but I gess theyre oney blowin, blast em. One thing's
                  sartin, howsever; that cunnin old rebel bird Ginral Jackson, got Ginral Reno inter
                  an ambush on Munday evenin down to Fairfacts, and tho the rebels was finerly druv
                  in, a hull divishin cum all-critical near bein cut off, besides loosin the brave
                  Kearny and Stevens, two as thurrowhred heroes as ever fit for the old flag senst
                  she was fust unfurld on the battle feeld of Saratoga eighty-three years ago.
               It must be confest that matters at present wares rayther a glummy aspic, and it
                  seems as ef the old sarpint was dooin his all-sulfurus utmost to help the rebel
                  cawse. I spose he simperthises thises
                  with it on ackount of his hevin ben a traitor hisself and compeld at an airly
                  peeriud in the Dark Ages to skeddadle afore the charge of the Excelsior Brigade of
                  Pairodice to the unhelthy lowcashin war he now hangs out. But altho Sinsinnaughty
                  is threttened by the blastfeemin rebels with the fate of the cities of the Plain,
                  and Merryland, in consekens of Jackson's reported bender, is blevd by menny to be
                  in a grevus strait, me and my cherful and mayjestic frend, the lofty and lively
                  Lincoln, hes still the strongest confidens in the ultimut tryump of the Union
                  arms. Legs tallionis he ses will sun be the order of the day,
                  and he hops, to use his own sublime eggspresshin, "that the six hunderd thousand
                  men now runnin regairdless of eggspens to the reskyou of thar kentry, will sunner
                  or later return to the peaceful walks of civil life." Nuther him nor me bleves
                  that the cabbynet imbersillity and milentary jelassy and want of gumpshin, is goin
                  to swomp the Union; and we dont mean to bleve it ontil Washington is tuck by
                  storm, Bawltomore surrendered, Sinsinnaughty conflagrated, and a conkerin Suthern
                  army on root for Philadelphy and New York.
               It is cheerin to refleck that the last battle of Bull Run hes not been follered by
                  wus consekenses than the fust. Ginral Pope hes trod ackeritly in the footsteps of
                  his illustris predecesher Ginral Macdoill—vamosin from Bull Run to Centreveal,
                  from Centreveal to Fairfacts, and from Fairfacts to Washington, whar I persoom he
                  will arrive to-day or to-morrer. The former—wun of the modestest men in the army,
                  and remarkabul for the number of prisners he takes—announst a tremenjus victry at
                  Bull Bun, jest as Ginral Macdoill bed dun afore him, and tuck the back track by
                  way of Centreveal, Fall's Church and Fairfacts, perzackly in the same way—oney
                  Macdoill's pace was rayther lower down among the forties than Pope's. I persoom,
                  howsever, ef Pope hedent hed them seventeen thousand prisners to restore to libty,
                  as he marveld along, he mought hev ekwild the time of that gentmanly ginral.
               I call him gentmanly, bekase the rebels sed he was a gentman and respeckted his
                  baggidge as setch at Catlett's Stashin, and they oughter kno. The Army of the
                  Potounac will mebbe be tonight about in the persishin it was in prevus to marchin
                  outer the fedral capital for Richmound more'n a year ago "singin sams and hims of
                  tryump", and wunst agin we hev the onspeakabul happiness of larnin arter spendin
                  twelve hunderd millyuns of dolors and using up two hunderd thousand men, that "the
                  government feels satisfied that Washinton is saift." In coarse ef the guverment is
                  satisfied the peeple must be satisfied. How in the name of desputism and Fort
                  Laugheryet ken they be ennything else!
               I seen considabul of my venabul and farseeshus frend the President doorin the
                  short time I was in Washington, and am happy to state throo your collumes, to the
                  popolashin of this continent and the nashins of the airth in ginral, that his
                  Eggsellensy is as spry as a cricket. The keers of State doosent peer to hev dampt
                  his sperrits a mite, and notwithstandin the desputes of his ginrals and the
                  divishins in his cabbynet, wittyschisms continnees to flow from his flewent lips
                  without sesashin, as ushil. He axed me yestday when I called to make my adoos at
                  the White House, "why thar was a difference atwixt Admiral Goldsburrow and the
                  hero of the Battle of Lake Erie." I remarkt that it was prehaps bekase the latter
                  went in and won, and the former oney went out and wonderd.
               "No," ses the distingwished Head of the Commonwelth, "no sirree!—it is bekase
                  Admiral Goldsburrow hesn't got no Perry Cranium." I hop the Naval
                  Champyun of Hamton Roads wont think it nessary to resine on ackount of this
                  harmless joak, and I dont think he will, for its purty much the same with offishal
                  foo-foos now, as it was in old Hickory's time, "few dies and nun resines."
               It will no dout be a consolashin to the down-harted kentry in the present tryin
                  crysis to larn that her eggsellensy, the lady Presidentess, is in salubrus helth,
                  and drives about in a butiful bayrush and pair, with et ceterys, lucking as
                  paytryotic—witch she is—as ef she hedent a traitor relashin in the world. She is a
                  remarkabul wumman; not so slim as the Empress Euginny; nor so tall as the Empress
                  of all the Rushes; nor so short as Queen Victory; but combinin all thar kwalities
                  of mind and person in a manner that it is diffikult to deskribe. Fearin I should
                  be onabul to do the subjeck jestice,I shall not attempt it; but ef the publick
                  mind will take the trubble to imadgin the stately grace of the two continental
                  empreses and the benignitty of the iland queen, kinder malgamated and mixed up and
                  mouldied altogether, they may begin to reallies what noboddy but a poick, with his
                  eye in a fine frenchy rollin, could adakwitly deskribe. N. P. Willis bought do it,
                  but setch flites of fancy is not for Disbanded Volunteers.
               Prehaps you and your readers may be a triful sprised at my usin tituls of honor in
                  speakin of the Eggseggative fammaly, but sech is the tendency of the times. Things
                  is gitten inter a monarky way allmity
                  rapid at Washington, and it lucks now as ef we should desput sun have a reglar
                  desputism. Not as the guverment means it. Oh no; but sumhow or uther the
                  simplesity of our republican system, and the saiftgards of the constitooshin, is
                  going to the devil about as fast as offishal presumpshin and lawless insolens ken
                  drive em. I dont no but merely for ritin this letter I may be sent to sum Barsteel
                  with a letter de catchit, and that you may be offered your
                  choice atween the Rip Raps and the Dry Tortoogus, for prentin it; but ef it should
                  be so we shell at least hev the satisfackshin of feline in our harts, that thars
                  few lyaler men than ourselves outer jail.
               This place is in a hubbub day and night with the sound of wheels and the vices of
                  teamsters and ambulance drivers. What with the shoutin of troops cummin in and
                  goin out, the milentary bands, the yells of drunken stragglers, and cetery, I
                  should say that Alexandry, jest now, cumpairs onfavorably with the Tower of Babbel
                  in the wust crysis of the unknown tungs. Hopin for a seeceshin of the deafenin row
                  when we hev silenst the row of seeceshin, I remain, distracted in brain, but lyal

                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               My asspirashins is disappinted. Long ear now I eggspected to hev ben on the march;
                  but I upbrayed noboddy. When Ginral Maclellin, onshagrinned by the loss of
                  Virginny, started in the airly part of the week to reconker Merryland, it was his
                  airnest wish that I should ackumpany him on the path of glory.
               "Disbanded," ses he, "I hev allus leaned onto you more'n all the rest of my staff.
                  Nex to my wife," ses he, in a tone of tender emoshin, "you hev my warmest
                  affeckshin and regaird, and I want to hev you allus at my bridal reign."
               But it warn't to be. It was my fate to be a nobjeck of competishin. About an hour
                  arter this flatterin conversashin, a messinger arrove on a fomin steed from the
                  White House, with a rekwest from my eggsalted frend, His Eggsellency the President
                  of the Remainder of the United States, for an immedient intervew on nayshinal
                  bizness. Singlar to relate, on reachin the fedral manshin, its Presidin Genus,
                  arter axin me, with his ushil curtsey, "how I flurrished", addrest me in nearly
                  the same langwidge as Ginral Maclellin dun, oney a triful more dignified. "D. V.,"
                  he remarkt, throwin his left leg over the back of wun of Mrs. Lincoln's new
                  droring-rum cheers, with that winnin grace for witch he is notoryus, "D. V.," old
                  feller, you musn't go to the Upper Potomac with Maclellin, for I hev more
                  confidens in you then in all the bullheads in my cabnet. Salmon Chase, to be sure,
                  is well enuff," he continned, "but I kant go Seward; and as to the funkshinary of
                  the War Department, he plays setch a game of cross porpuses that its onpossabul to
                  make head or tail of the flounderin critter. But you, D. V.," ses his eggsellency,
                  "you, old boss, air of a diffrent stripe. Let alone. Mrs. L.," ses his
                  eggsellency, "thars noboddy to hoom I ken unbuzzum myself in privit as I ken to
                  you."
               "But my simperthetic frend," I replide, "ef I back out of this raid inter
                  Merryland, my cumraids will overwelm me with satyr."
               "They be splinterd!" ses he, carrickteristically; "when the boss puts down his
                  foot and ses 'this is your post,' wot need you to keer for thar brashy
                  railin."
               I yielded, for I felt that to leve the rooler of the nashin, at setch a moment,
                  would be hard lines. I couldent abandun him to the tender marcies of his
                  vassalatin constitooshinal advisers. It would hev ben like deprivin him of his
                  backbone. Twyste a day, mornin and evenin, a solentary hossman, gray-headed, but
                  full of gumpshin, may be seen ridin in deep thort over the Long Bridge in the
                  direckshin of Washington. That's me. My dustynashin is the White House, whar I
                  remane in consultashin with the President from the hour of my arrival ontil his
                  eggsellency goes to sleep. I hev dun sum good allready. It was by my advice that
                  Burnside was sent out to feel the enemee, and that Pope, by way of a flyer, was
                  railed, by the neardest rout, to tuther
                  side of Jordan. By Jordan, I mean the Mussysippi. At my slisitashin, too,
                  Macdooil, the hero of two slashin defeets, was dispatched to parts onknown, to
                  remane tell called for; and ef you should hear, in the Lord's good time, that
                  Stanton's nose was outer jint, you won't be far rong in sirmysin that I bed a hand
                  in its disjlickashin.
               We—I refer to this individual and the Honolabul Abe—air dooin what we ken to
                  pervert the grate commershil. States of the North from fallin a pray to the
                  ongodly invaders. Ef possabul, Philadelphy will be saved, bekase, in case
                  Washington and Bawltomore is tuck, the President and Mrs. Lincoln prepose to set
                  for company thar doorin the gay seesin. Ef, howsever, the Keestone State should be
                  capterd by the ragged cusses, who in settin foot on our sile declared thar
                  intenshin to "conkser a piece," thee illustrus fedral pair will adjern to New York
                  tell the openin of the spring camppain and will probly ockipy ether the Acadmy of
                  Musick or the Cooper Institoot, while the members of the cabnet will be
                  accommnydated at the Blind Asylum. I bleve the President would prefer retirin to
                  Springfield, whar he belongs; but that would be rayther reskry, bekase ef the
                  rebels seesed Sinsinnaughty the grate commershil meatroplis of the West—he mought
                  hev to depend eggscloosivly on Illanoy for milentary suckers.
               We hope, howsever, to turn the tables onto the rebels, smash thar picters!
                  Maclellin is arter em in Merryland with at sharp stick, and ef he doosent stop to
                  dig, thousands of em will find a bluddy grave on this, side of the Potomack. My
                  own pinyun is that thar present incurshin is oney a faint, and, in fack, the last
                  dispatch from the seat of war ses they air fallin back. The report that thar lines
                  reeches from Sinacur Cricks to Mungummery Court House is considerd mung news, and
                  I persooin thar numbers in Prence George hes be magnifide ekwil to Falstaff's
                  Lincoln Green Men, in his lyin yarn to Prence Henry. Wot Lee and Longstreet is up
                  to is to dror our forces inter the inteeryur of Merryland, and then pitch inter us
                  at Washington with mebbe a hunderd and fifty thousands men. Ef Maclellin,
                  Burnside, Fits John Porter, Banks, and Hindsellmana doos thar duty, that game's
                  blocked, and the Jeffocracy is in an all-exscrewshiatin fix. Its a goldin chain or
                  a wooden leg, as the saylin is. The Cornfedracy is ether on the eve of a grand
                  trium1p or an everlastin kullaps.
               In the meentime, let the peeple, when they assembul in thar places of public
                  wurship, and evry night and mornin in thar privit devoshins, try to pray a little
                  common sense inter the head of the War Department, and all strutegy outer the
                  heads of our ginrals in the feeld. As to the President, Ile take keer of him; and,
                  notwithstandin his onrepressabul humor, I hev sanguinary hopes of convincin him,
                  in the eend, that this war is sumthin beyant a joak. Starnly and sorrerfully, I
                  remane,

                  [Since the President has been guided by the advice of our sagacious
                     correspondent, everything seems to have gone well. Let us hope he may continue
                     to turn a favorable ear to the Disbanded's words of wisdom. We invite attention

                     WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DEESTRICK OF COLUMBY, September 18,
                        1862.
                     Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
                  
                  The hull kentry has reson to rejice that the able-minded Abraham kep me back
                     from the feeld of mortil combat to help organize victory. We hev dun the job!
                     thanks to Hallyloover. We hev redooced the Hiderheaded Rebellytin to the last
                     eggstremity, and by the time this reaches you, it is not onlikely that its tail
                     will be tolled. I am now settin in the President's privit parlor at the White
                     House, opposit that accomplisht statesman and worrier, who is onkonshusly to
                     hisself carvin the inishals of his immortal name onto the back of a rosewood
                        teet-a-teet. We air awaitin glad tidings from the Upper
                     Potomac—the last ackounts bein that Longstreet was hemmed inter a cool
                        de sack, and would be bagged immediently. I think, from the moshin
                     of his hand, as he whittles the teet-a-teet, that his
                     Eggsellency feels the least mite narvous; but he hesent enny call to be.
                     Howsever, I'll test the state of his thortful and actyve mind by a few
                     inderogatories, and give you the conversashin jest as it cums, off. Hear
                     goes:
                  D. T.—My resposabul frend, wot is your onbyassed opinyun of the last tellagram
                     from Harassburg. It ses the rebellyun is virtuously subdood."
                  A. L. (shetting his nife and assumin a statesmanlike apperience ginally).—Wall, Disbanded, the tenner of the
                     advices would seem to indicate a ten-strike. But the forten of war is onsartin,
                     eggsept for army contractors. Hooker was wownded in the foot while chasin the
                     fo, witch is rayther agen his cummin up with em, tho he's not the man to make
                     lame eggscuses for not puttin the best leg foremost. Then its menshint as wun
                     of the Hills is taken, but as the Cornfedrits ockypied a ridge of hills a mild
                     and a hafe long, its onpossabul to say wether the wun that's tuck cummanded
                     enny of thar persishins. Upon the hull, the probility is that ef the rebel army
                     hes been forced to the Potomac, and ef the river hes riz as reported, it will
                     uther sirrender or be stript of everything, and hev to swim for bar life.
                  D. V.—Wal sed, my seckind Washington! Your conclooshins from the flyin darter
                     of the tellagraft is wurthy of the Father of his Kentry in the days that tried
                     men's soles. Wot's your offishal estimit of Ginral Maclellin about these days,
                     my Paytryotic Trump?
                  A. L.—Maclellin—eh? (pullin his left whisker as ef he was a milkin), wal I
                     think he's gin the Freemounters jessie, as well as treted the rebels to a lofty
                     fall. But in a fight, much depends on keerful backers. Mebbe ef Stanton hed ben
                     his bottle-holder, insted of Halleck, he mought hev ben fibbed down, as he was
                     on the Peninslur.
                  D. V.—Gess youre right thar my junior Hickory. Stanton's a fine feller—a kinder
                     feller in fack that would stand at a man's back and see his brains blown out
                     without budgin a har's bredth; but upon the hull I don't crave to fight under
                     his asspieces. Onderstand me, howsever, I hev nuthin to say agin the Seckatry
                     of War. Far from it. I consider him a present man for a small party, and as his
                     party is the smallest out, I dessay they hev a good time together.
                  A. L.—D. V., youre a sinnick; but I kant kwarrel with you, bekase ef it hedent
                     a ben for you and Halleck, I dunno but Jeff Davis mought now hev ben in the
                     White House, and me and Mrs. L. onhappy fudgetives. Is thar ennything I ken do
                     for you? Would you like to go inter the Cabnet, or hev a swoord of honor gin to
                     you, or a contrack, or be a minster to Saint James, or a consol, with a chanst
                     to put yourself in funds for life, or a Bragadear Ginral, or an Injun
                     Commishiner, or a Rare Admiral or a United States Tresherer with the run of the
                     mint and no kwestins axed, or a colonizin agent for the Contrabands, or my
                     sucksessor to the Presidenshil Cheer, or—
                  D. V. (interruptin the catalog)—Nary wun, my buzzum frend, nary wun. Ive seen
                     enuff fishal raskality, meanness, jellysee, hatred, maliss, and
                     oncharitabulness senst this war commenst, to feel that the oney post of honor
                     is the privit stashin. Ime nuther a politishin nor a parricide; and I dont want
                     ether to belong to the aristocracy or the democracy, but jest to the
                     mediocracy, witch doosent keer a red for purpel and fine linnen, but isent abuv
                     sope and water and waring clean shirts.
                  A. L. (with a deep sithe).—Say no more, D. V., say no more; you put me in mind
                     of Pope's lines—I mean the poick, not the major-ginral: 
                        
                           "A wit's a fether, and a cheef's a rod,
                           An honest man's the noblest work of God."
                        
                     
                  
                  Bein all three myself, I ken feelingly subscribe to the truth of the cupple
                     it.
                  MESSINGER BOY FROM THE TELLAGRAFT OFFICE (rushin in with sawsir eyes, in a
                     fewroar of eggsightment).—Sir-r-r! Gentmen! Nuther dispatch! Ginral
                     Longstreet's killed and Ginral Cobb's a prisoner.
                  A. L.—That boy, D. V., reminds me of a remarkabul insident. Menny years ago,
                     when I was navigatin the Ohio as a flat—
                  SECKIND MESSINGER BOY (in a perfoose pressperashin).—Mr. President—nuther
                     dispatch! Ginral Longstreet isn't killed, but he's tuck, and Ginral Cobb's
                     wownded.
                  A. L.—Blame these boys, wot boyant sperrits they hey. Wal, as I was sayin, when
                     I was navigatin the Ohio as a flat boatman, many pears ago, the craft got
                     aground and my mate, sez he, Old Stick-in-the-mud—
                  THIRD MESSENGER BOY (pantin heavily).—Nuther dispatch! Burnsides turnt Jacksons
                     flank and is pressin onto his rare. Porter is shellin Cobb, and Franklin hes
                     gin Lee thunder and lighten. Hooker's wownd is easier, and he is agin in
                     ackshin with his foot in a sling.
                  A. L. (throwin him a postage currency).—Thats the way to mall em! But whar was
                     I! O! I remember—my mate, ses he, Old Stick-in-the-mud, are you awar why you
                     run aground? No, ses I. Ses he, its bekase thars no reliance to be placed on
                     the boys, pintin to the flotin bekins in the channel. You see the nub of the
                     joke I spose. The tellagraft is a mity unsartin channel of informashin, and it
                     wont do to trust to the boys. He! he! he!
                  D. V. (as in duty bound).—Ha! ha! ha! Ho! ho! ho! Tiger-r-r!!!
                  
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     ALEXANDRY, September 19, 1862.
                  
                  Shortly arter the President had finisht his apropo story, victries began to cum
                     in so everlastin thick, that it was enuff to drive the most flegmatic Unionists
                     inter a state of halloocynashin, so I seezed my hat and vamosed in eggstacy,
                     leavin the President singin the Star Spangled Banner at the top of his vice,
                     witch is purty high, and keepin time with the heels of his boots on the senter
                     table.
                  It is onnessary to rekapitalate the sperrit-stirrin noose of to-day, as you
                     will hev all the tremenjus tryumps over the wires, as fast as the enemee is
                     anialated, and cut to pieces, and taken prisners, and sent to the rare utterly
                     demoralized to take the oath and rally wunst more under the old flag.
                  
                     Fateeged with glory,
                     Yours allus,

                  [The Disbanded is not an egotist. Far from it. He simply wishes to be credited
                     with his own thunder, and he insists that the Emancipation Proclamation (except
                     the spellin and pronunciation) is his thunder. We give him an opportunity to do
                     himself justice in our columns. He seems to disclaim Proclamation No. 2 even
                     more emphatically than he claims Proclamation No. 1.—EDS.]
               
               
                  ALEXANDRY, VIRGINNY, September 26, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Wal, wot do you think of Abraham Lincoln's style of runnin the masheen onder my
                  foremanship? We air a teem and a hafe and a bull tarrier atween the ropes, and no
                  mistake. That Nigger-manspayshin dockament was a sockdolager, warnt it? Its sum I
                  tell you, and ef it doosent eend the war afore nex summer the blacks will be sure
                  to rise in the fall. Luck at the normus axseshins its goin to bring to the army
                  from the abelishinist ranks. Them nine hunderd thousand aunty-slavers thats ben a
                  standin with thar guns loaded and capt, thar bagnets fixt, and thar legs lifted
                  for a start on the dubbel kwick for the last eighteen tunts, waitin for jest setch
                  a proclamashin, will in coarse all speak to wunst and demand to be led agin the
                  enemee. I persoom they air now rushin in crowds to all the Nuthern recrutin
                  stashens, blessin me and Abraham Lincoln, and resolved to kiver tharselves with
                  uniforms and glory. Let em cum—don't stop em—pervide transportashin for all of
                  em—and dont ax em whether they go for the Union as it was or it wasent, as it is
                  or it isent; but take advantage of thar fewroar and let em go in—outer the draft!
                  The kullerd peeple eggspects em, rain or shine, and Cashus of Kaintucky will cross
                  the Rubygun with em, and sink or swim, survive or perish in the attemp. A
                  proclamashin as brings nine hunderd thousand men inter the feeld is a dockament
                  that'll live, as the poick ses," to the last syllabub of recorded Time." Rich Loo
                  was right—"In the hands of men entirely great," like Abe and Me, "the pen is
                  miteyer'n the swoord!"
               Senst the abuv parrygraft was writ, a frend of mine, a feller who is allus puttin
                  a spoke inter other peeples weals, hes stept in and subjested a diffrent vew of
                  the case. He allows that the abelishinists heving nuthin at hart in this war but
                  the onfetterin of the kullerd race, will dekline takin up arms ontil arter the 1st
                  of January, for fare of fritenin the Suthern States and causen em to return to
                  thar a legions; tharby preventin the onfortnit slaves from bein "thenceforrard and
                  forever free." Consekently, he argoos, no help need be eggspected from that
                  kwarter ontil arter New Years. But I dont bleve it. It kant be as the luv of the
                  Manspayshunists for men of Afrikin dissent, is parrymount to thar luv of this
                  blessed Union. As to usin this plee as a subterfudge in order to keep clar of
                  danger (as the feller hinted when he was goin away)—that I wont credit. Sartainly
                  no American would plead affeckshin for the race of Ham as an eggscuse to save his
                  bacon. I tharfore dismiss the insinnerashin from my mind—tho I kant help wishin
                  the infarnal croker hedent a put the thing in that light, for it haunts me.
               The proclamashin is shoor to create a perfound sensashin abrord. It kennot fail to
                  shet up Lord Pamstun like a jack-nife and thro the Darby cleek inter a state of
                  asfixyou. Both perfesses to be willin to go the hull hog for the eggstinkshin of
                  human bondage, and thar oney avoud resin for bristlin up agin the North so fur,
                  hes ben that while deprivin the wurld of cotton we warnt tryin to make wool free.
                  The new state paper got up by Abraham and Me, nocks that stool from onder em, and
                  they must uther take our side now, or sobside inter everlastin oblokwee and
                  contemp. It will be likewise the same in France. We hev taken the wind outer the sails of both
                  guverments, and they must uther change thar toon tords the North, or they'll hev
                  the peeple in thar har and git thar combs cut afore they know it.
               The press is a greet and solem instooshin—the Playdum of our Libties and the
                  Bullwork of this Oxidental Land of Freedom* —but sumtimes its allcussed mean. I dessay, now,
                  that sum of your New York papers will try to make thar reeders bleve that the
                  Cabnet hed a hand in the proclamashin. Wun, mebbe, will say that it is marked with
                  the perfound depth of Welles, anuther that it is in the Chaste stile of the
                  Seckatry of the Tresury, and a third that it sounds like Blare; but wunst for all
                  let setch invidyus prents be gin to onderstand that I rit it myself, with no help
                  from nobody, and that Abraham Lincoln, God bless him! punctured the sentences and
                  korrected the spellin. We alone are the orthurs, and We take the responsbility. I
                  hed great difficulty in preventin the President from making a foo-foo of hisself,
                  by takin the advice of his Cabnet on the subjeck, but I suckseeded. I dont crave
                  enny man wurship for my sarvices, howsever. I am satisfied with deservin well of
                  my kentry, and dont hanker arter sickofancy and serenades.
               
                  *Livin so mutch in diplomatic sirkils, wun gets a habit of usin high-flown langwidge.
               
               But I kant allus be with my buzzum frend the President. I hev other dooties, witch
                  it is onpossible for me to shirk with a clar conshence, that ockashinally prevents
                  my bein at his elbo. On setch ockashins, advantage is tuck of his amabel
                  weaknesses, by a passel of pollytickle tinkers as doosent no thar a-b, abs in the
                  skience of statemanship. Frinstance, when I was off to Bawltomore on milentary
                  bizness, this week, he was overperswaded to issoo anuther proclamashin, witch I am
                  afeard he'll hev cause to repent to his dyin day. I mean, in coarse, the despotick
                  dockamint as puts privit citysins in the North onder marshil law, and subjecks em
                  to be tried and punisht by milentary commishins, for sayin or dooin ennything
                  witch in the opinyun of provost marshals and setch is calkilated to discurridge
                  inlistments. I shed teers when I seen that in prent—weepin partly for my freend,
                  and partly for my kentry. Its onconstitooshinal, onnessacry, and onjest, and I
                  should say the same to that esteemabul man, Marshal Kenaday, even onder the
                  penalty of bein ackommodated with lodgins in Sell number Four for the night. The
                  North doosent rekwire to be put onder marshil law at the marcy and discreshin of
                  provost-marshil's gards. Howsever, I hope to get the President uther to revoke the
                  order or to eggsplain it away.
               In the meantime, and with the firm bleef that the price of Libity is etarnul
                  vidgelans, I remain, as ushil,
               
                  Yours allus,

                  ALEXANDRY, Virginny, October 3, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Ef the President could spar me, Ide a heep rayther be fightin in the feeld then
                  civilly emploid here. Howsever, as we air hand and gluv, and he leans onto me as a
                  disintrusted frend, I must see him throo; tho bobbin around in these red-tape
                  rejins doosen soot an old worrier whoos bizness it is to face his kentry's foes on
                  the battle-plane and kiver hisself with the green baize of victry. I couldent, you
                  no (leastways not onably), throw up my hand and leve honest Old Abe to go it alone
                  agin the Artful Dodgers as is continally tryin to sarcumvent him. It wouldent tell
                  well in histry; and I want to bequeeth a clean reckord to my bihographers, and go
                  down to the futur as sumthin better'n a mere stypendry.
               Noboddy as isent behind the seens ken reelize the dance His Eggsellency is led by
                  woolves in sheep's clothin, and ef it warnt for me, thars no sayin wot orful false
                  steps he mought be inveggled inter. All sorts of spurus stuff is coined by party
                  shysters, in order to put him on a rong cent, but I ken smell a rat as far as the
                  next man, and he nose it; consekently he ginally relies on me for the truth in
                  doutful cases, and could I be perpetally at his side, thar'd be no dannger of his
                  makin enny foe pause.
               But, as I intermated in my last, I can't allus be with the great and good Abraham,
                  altho I perfess to be his buzzum frend. Kernil Hamilton couldent allus be with the
                  Father of his Kentry, you no; and I stand purty much in the same relashin to Mr. Lincoln as the kernil did to Ginral
                  Washington. I enjoy the President's wittyschisms and egerly devour his wurds of
                  wisdom, but nater rekwires short intermisshins for refreshments, even at
                  theayters, and sircusses, and nigger pufformances, and arter a pertracted dialog
                  with the head of the nashin, full of sourcasm and brilyant subjestins, its a
                  wunderful relief to spend a day or so in the Alezandry horspittles, skrapin lint,
                  fixin bondages, and admenisterin doses of muckory and ruebub.
               On setch ockashins, sartain pollytickle letherheads ushilly seeses the
                  opportoonity to abuse the ears and thro dust in the eyes of my eggsalted frend.
                  Sum of this preshus set—pertickler pals of wun dubble-faced Jimmy you may have
                  heerd on—was all-cussed near gettin him to keep back his mansipashin manafester,
                  arter it hed ben sot up and red in the galleys; but providenshally I cum in from a
                  ride to the Chain Bridge jest in time to snap the links of the conspurracy, and
                  save four millyuns of blacks from the blues. I predicate they'll never hear of wot
                  I dun for em; but ef they should, they needent send a depitashin to thank me ontil
                  the wether's cooler and the wind's nutherly. I want em to be free, the Lord nose;
                  but senst it hes plesed Hevin to form em out of ebony and me outer plaster of
                  parish, and to make uther essenshil diffrences atween us, Ide a leetle rayther
                  they kep tharselves to tharselves. Notwithstandin the ties of flesh and blud that
                  links me to my brothers in bonds, I wouldent thro a straw in the way of sendin em
                  to Haytie. Setch also is the sentamens of the distingwished lumberman and logishin
                  who is desarvedly the idle of a free peeple. Jest afore he started on Wensday to
                  visit Maclellin at Aunteatem, we figgerd out the colornisashin skeem in black and
                  white, and found it perfeckly feesable, ef Congress will oney make the nessary
                  appropriashins. Abe's estimit is as follers: 
                     
                        Provishins and clothin, fewill, and cetera, for 4,000,000 collard
                           pussons, while arrangements is making to ship em off, say $50
                           each$200,000,000
                     
                        Outfit for vige to the colorny, purchis of land, tools and implements
                           of husbandry, eggspens of transportashin, and supplies for 400,000000
                           collard pussons ontil the craps cums in, say $300
                        each1,200,000,000
                     
                        Total1,400,000,000
                  
               
               The amount is not hevy, on paper (wotever it mought be in gold), and could be
                  prented off by the time the proclamashin is practickly carrid out, and mebbe
                  afore, at little mor'n the cost of press-wurk. Let us, tharfore, release our
                  opprest collard brethren with as little delay as possabul, and send em forth to
                  thar new hum with the kiss of peace, trustin to thar gratitood to reimbuss us as
                  sun as they becum a grate nashin. Peeple as is inklined to make mountins of
                  molehills may objeck to the outlay, but I think ef Ossawartomy Brown was alive he
                  would approov the projeck. The plan is as simpel as it is butiful. Its oney to
                  conker the South, raze the funds, and "let my peeple go".
               I hinted abuv that parties was allus on the luckout for my absens from the White
                  House to take advantidge of the President's easy dispersishin. It was on wun of
                  those ockashins that Blare got his sankshin to that order of his'n discreditin all
                  the siled P.O. stamps, a perseedin that in my opinyun puts the stamp of bad faith
                  on the Department's deelins with the peeple. The rich mayn't keer about bein stuck
                  with a few adhesivs, mebbe, but wot I luck at is the effeck on the poor man's
                  plasters. Its a dirty trick, to say the leest of it; enuff, by gum! to make the
                  faces of Washington and Franklin blush for thar persishin. Its my privit opinyun
                  that ef the order isent recinderd, thar'll be a vakincy in the Cabnet purty
                  recently.
               I was over to Ginral Maclellin's head-kwarters at Harper's Ferry on Thursday, and
                  me and him and the President hed a long and airnest confth. The result of our
                  codgertashins was, that the war must be pusht ahead like sixty. Within a few days
                  arter this epistol reeches you, its not onlikely a blo may be struck that will hev
                  an electrick effeck on the kentry as far as the wires eggstend.
               Hopin you will keep on the key veeve for the latest noose, I remane, and so doos
                  the venabul Abraham,
               
                  Yours allus,
                  A DISBANDED VOLUNTEER.

                  [The Disbanded comes nobly to the rescue of his friend the President, defending
                     him most gallantly from the aspersions of those malignant persons who represent
                     him as playing a double game in the present crisis. He also gives some
                     remarkable specimens of Mr. Lincoln's peculiar vein of humor. There is one
                     great merit in his letters. He writes veraciously, never drawing on his imagination for his facts as so
                     many newspaper correspondents do.—EDS.]
               
               
                  ALEXANDRY, VIRGINNY, October 10, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Its rayther amewsin to see the curryspondents of the New York daylies pretendin to
                  giv the President's privit vews and sentimens, when they hev no more chanst to get
                  inter his konfidense than Dives hed to lay off with Lazyrus in Abraham's buzzum.
                  Thars jest wun man, and no more, to whoom the hole of his hart is laid open, and
                  to whoom he livers his opinyuns on State kwestins according to the varus lights in
                  wich they present tharselves to his onderstandin. I am that individval. You probly
                  red in childhood, or doorin the peeryud of addle essence, the story of Valentine's
                  fondness for Arson and vicey versey. Well, the President is my
                  Valentine. Correspondingly I am his Arson. He looks upon me as his warmest frend,
                  and never while the spark of life glows in my brest shall he hev resin to think
                  utherwise. Ime sorry to say he is mutch traydooced by a pack of knaves, who
                  pertend to say that he's playin a tricky game with all parties. Its not so. He may
                  be vassalatin, he may hev his amabul weaknesses, his backbone may be rather over
                  soople, he may be too mutch gin to the cherful anakdoat, the loodickrus tale, and
                  the light cannondrum, but his intenshins is fust rate—they couldn't be fast rater
                  ef he ockapied a manshin in the skies insted of on Pennsylvany Avenoo. I no wot
                  you will say—namely that in the bottomless pit, the street commishiners use good
                  intenshins to lay the sidewalks. But doos that detrack from thar merits? Not by no
                  means. You mought as well denounce postidge-stamps—the oridgenal purpose of witch
                  was good—bekase they hev ben emplied improperly. A thing may be eggsellent
                     per see, as the lawyers say, but yet not turn out for the
                  best by a darnd sight.
               All men as holds high places is liabul to be salted by malignant backbiters. It is
                  the natur of setch critters to kick at whoosumdever hes a seat of honor. The fust
                  nateralist of his day was orfully abused when he perclaimed a new system of
                  classifyin animils, and so, arter all, the lustrus statesman of Illanoy oney
                  sheers the fate of the Great Buffoon. But enuff of this. Valentine needs no
                  defence from Arson. His ax speaks for tharselves.
               I returnt here from the White House about an hour ago in Mr. Lincoln's bayrush,
                  arter heving ben in privit consultashin with him on matters of the highest moment
                  for uppards of forty minnits. He sent for me eggpress by a speshil messenger, and
                  on arrivin, axed me to walk inter his Cabnet, wich I did, and he immedientely shet
                  the door, locked it, and hung his Skotch cloke and cap over the key-hole to
                  pervent—as he sed in his commic way—enny of the wimmin fokes from Evesdroppin. We
                  then shuck hands corjally like two old cumraids as we air, and sot down to airnest
                  codgertashin. In less'n ten minnits we decided on sartain civil and milentary
                  changes, witch you will sun see announced ofishally. Ef I warn't injoined to
                  silence, I mought state, prehaps, that thar would shortly be a desjunkshin of the
                  Cabnet, but as it is I say nuthin. Stanton's adherents would feel bad ef they knew
                  the Presdent warnt inclined to stick by him enny longer. Mind, I dont say as thar
                  acktilly is a prospect of the Seckatry of War bein dropt; I oney say ef. The
                  frends of Ginral Banks would no dout like to see him in Stanton's shoop; but ef
                  such an arrangement was on foot—mind, I say ef it was on foot, not as it is—it
                  would be a breech of confidens in me to menshin it. Tharfore, as an onabul man, I
                  shall keep dark, and merely ventur a vaig hop that the resinabul wishes of the
                  nayshin may not be disappinted.
               Arter we'd finisht up on Guvcnment bizness, my eggseggative frend releved his
                  logical mind, as ushil, with a little farceshy. Handin out from a cubbard a bottle
                  of the essence of Mungoheeler (for he nose I'm parsbil to that tawny and tasty
                  flewid), he axed me what would be the most approprate place to expatiate the
                  blacks to.
               Thinkin I smelt the joak, I winked my wether eye and sed "to Scenterall America".
                  He shuck his hed, so I overhauld my jografy a seckind time, and thinkin Ide try
                  Europe, I sed "the Valley of the Oder".
               Agin he signified dissent—upon witch I revarted to the Western Hemisfear, and
                  remarked that mebbe the Colorahdo mought soot our colored brethren when eggspelled
                  from the pale of civilisashin.
               Wunst more he made a jester in the niggertive, upon witch I gin it up.
               He then eggsplaned that the most appropriate place to expatiate the contrabands
                  to, would be Mountanegro, whar they would have a chanst to rise in the world and
                  would be within conveenient distans of a Sea of thetr own complexshin.
               I remarkt that in the wurds of the poick, "the wurld was all afore em whar to
                  choose", but I hoped Providence wouldn't gide em ennywhars near my diggens. "Afrikry," ses I, is
                  thar nateral, clime. Thar," ses I, kwotin poickry agin, 
                     
                        "Thar let em blush onseen,
                        And waste thar sweetness on the desert air."
                     
                  
               
               When I menshint Afriky, I notist that A. L.'s left eye gin a premonitory twinkle,
                  and as sun's Ide finisht speakin, he fixed me ef I know'd what kinder teas that
                  continent perdooced. Bein onabul to respond, he was kind enuff to inform me that
                  it was famous for its Congoes and its Ashanteas. I told him that ef he hed to be
                  expatiated to a furrin land, we should all know whar to send him. He cort my
                  meanin direckly, and sed he sposed to the Punjawb. Although blunt in his manners,
                  he's all-amazin sharp in his percepshins.
               Noticin that I was about to indulge in a glasss of whisky, he inkwired, with his
                  pqliar smild, why his joaks was like the licker I was goin to swaller. It was
                  beyant me, and I sed so, upon witch he subjested that his joaks was like the
                  licker I was preparin to imbibe bekase they was pleasant-rye. You see the pint I
                  spose.
               "But, my venabul trend," ses I, arter he hed got off the last menshint stunner,
                  "don't you think that this kinder badinage is onshootable in the preset momentuous
                  crysis."
               "D. V.," ses he, risin from his cheer and ketchin me by the button, "D. V., you
                  put me in mind of Wade, the cheermatn of Committee on the Conduck of the War. Sun
                  arter Pope was druv in by Lee," continned the President, "Wade called on me and
                  wanted to hev a serus tork on milentary affairs. Ses I to him: 'Mr. Wadce, you
                  remind me of a man out West as hed a sellybrated hoss—' 'Thunder! Mr. President,'
                  shouted Wade, interruptin me, 'this ain't a time for you to tell stud-hoss
                  stories! and, by Gosh! I'm not the man to listen to em!' He was rushin out mad as
                  a hornet, but I called him back and got his dander down, and we hed a reglar
                  offishal palaver. When we got throo, ses I to him: 'My Buckeye frend, ef wit was
                  an artickle as went by the pound, I gess you'd be Wade in the balance and found
                  wantin.' 'Yes,' he rejined (the sassy cuss), 'you'd hev the advantidge of me thar,
                  Mr. President, for your joaks is a leetle the hevyest as ever was
                  mannyfacterd.'"
               As his Eggsellency konclooded the foregoin anakdoat, I jump from my seat, shuck
                  hands with him hurridly, and, complainin of a sudden attact of morril insanity,
                  left the presence. I raaly bleve ef I hed remained three minnits longer I should
                  never agin, have ben abel to remain, in a loocid condishin,

                  [The countenance and friendship of the great is not without, its
                     inconveniences. We see by a passage in the subjoined letter from our
                     correspondent at the seat of Government, that in consequence of his intimacy
                     with the President, he is continually beset, through the mails, with
                     applications to use his influence with that distinguished personage in
                     futherance of the private ends of mercenary individuals. Many of the
                     applications, it seems, are accompanied by sums of money, which, we are
                     rejoiced to learn, he devotes to the noblest of all charitable objects, the
                     liquidation of the public debt. For the information of the ignorant, we deem it
                     due to our correspondent to say, that he has never been in Congress, the New
                     York Board of Aldermen, or any of the Contract Bureaux of the Federal
                     Government. It is therefore fair to presume that he is a gentleman, and not a

                  ALEXANDRY, VIRGINNY, October 17, 1862.
                  Eddytur of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The Cabnet is still in Statue Co. Practickly thars a vakincy in the
                  War Department, but its Head will not be remooved. Thar air complaints of delays
                  in the Navy Department, but it is doutful wether we could cure these ills, by
                  ousting Welles. In the State Office thars so very little dooing jest now that the
                  Seckatry ken purshoo his privit game of pollytickle dubble-shuffe without
                  detriment to the publick intrests, add the portfoolyou of the Inteeryur is in,
                  purty saift hands. A mana of a different stompt to Blare mought do better in the
                  Post Offiz; but as he is a teller of considabul gumshin in sum respecks, he will
                  be aloud for a while to stick to his post. Doorin the sickness off Seckatry Chase,
                  a strong effort was made by the conservative cleek to get him soopersedid; but
                  both the President and Me sot our faces agen it In toe-toe, and I am ortherized to
                  say thar whil be no change in the
                  Tresury prevus to the meetin of Congress. This intelligens I persoom will be
                  satisfactory to all as hev finanshil dealins with the guverment, and will probly
                  cause an immedient rise inz public skewerities.
               My worthy compaytryit, the inestimable Abe, is mutch consarned at the uppard
                  tendency of gold. Bein as it is the mut of all evil, he naterally sposed that its
                  byass would be tuther way. He asked me yestday wether it would stop whar it was or
                  continny on, to witch I replidle that it warent mutch consekens, as it hed ben for
                  sum time outer sight.
               "But how do you account for the feenonaman?" ses he.
               "Wal," ses I, "the hig appressiashin of gold is caused by the low depressiashin of
                  paper."
               But he dident see it. Also he didn't see why bekase gold went up, flour, and coal,
                  and bacon and uther cumoddities should go up likewise. I eggsplained that gold was
                  the standard of thar valley, and that cumoddities, like armies, was obligated to
                  fowler thar standard. He nodded a cent to this doctrine and remaned for sevral
                  minnits in deep thort. I shouldent be sprised ef he was studdyin out a new fiskal
                  sistem, for he remarkt when he cum to that "a stop must be put to the nessaries of
                  life follerin in the track of gold, like guests at Niagra footin it arter thar
                  gide up Biddle's staircase." He's a remarkabul man, is my illustrus frend, and it
                  wouldent astonish me enny ef he was to subjest to Congress setch a bankin skem as
                  would render the millyuns of dolors that's ben infested in the suppreshin of the
                  rebellyun, as aekewer as ef evry greenback was in Abraham's buzzum. In course ef
                  he hes setch an idee, the projeck will be submitted to me afore its submitted to
                  the Assembeld Wisdum, and I'll take keer you hev the outlines in advance of any
                  flunkey stealin em for the Herald.
               High persishins hes thar dror backs. The fack that the President bleves in me, and
                  ax solely by my advice senst he diskivered the short summings of his Cabnet, is
                  givin me an allplaygey sight of trubble. Grossly flatterin letter from
                  pollytishins outer emplyment, exing me to say a good word for em to his
                  Eggsellency, pores in at the rate of about hafe a gross a day. Sum contanes demand
                  notes, stiffcuts of deposit and setch. The riters eggspect to "condaminate my

                  raskils! Darned fools too!—I send all that "soap" to the Fust Awditer fo the

                              TO THE DISBANDED VOLUNTEER:
                           
                           
                              Honored and Respected Patriot:—Permit a constant reader
                              and enthusiastic admirer of your graphic and eloquent letters—which
                              are equaled by few and excelled by none, and which, if published in
                              book form, with illustrations by distinguished artists, and properly
                              introduced, to the public by a liberal and enlightened press, would
                              create a sensation unknown since the days of Junius—to ask your kind
                              offices with the President to obtain for me a contract for the removal
                              of warts from the fingers of the army of the Potomac during the
                              present and ensuing season. It is as difflcult for the soldier
                              troulbled with warts to handle his arms, as for the soldier with corns
                              to handle his feet. Even Dr. Zacharie must admit this. I have
                              suggested a period of profound repose for the performance of the
                              operations, in order not to interfere with the military movements
                              which, it is understood, are expected to take, place—if circumstances
                              are favorable—during the ensuing summer. My idea of compensation for
                              obliteratin the excrescences is one thousand dollars per hundred. I
                              inclose a fifty as a mark of my esteem for your great literary
                              talents, and with the remark that there is more where that come from,
                              I remain, with profound respect,
                           
                              Yours ever,
                              A. Cautery, M. D.
                           
                        
                        
                           P. S.—Of course you will not imagine that the trifle of which I ask
                              your acceptance as a tribute to genius, has ally bearing upon the
                              frank request contained in this letter. Who would ever dream of
                              offering a bribe to one who adds to the prowess of an Alexander the
                              virtue of a Lucretia!
                        
                        
                           P. S. 2d.—Do not suppose that in paying a just compliment to your
                              transcendent abilities I am actuated by a parasitical desire to
                              flatter. My wife, the most, candid, thoughtful, and simple-hearted of
                              her sex, is in raptures with your letters, and be atssured she is not
                              one to "crook the pregnant hinges of the knee," etc., etc. She
                              requests me to say that she hopes when you visit New York you will
                              take dinner with us in a family way.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Thar!—did you ever read setch sickenin sickofancy? And I ain acktilly in the
                  reseat of kwires of the same sorter staff. I want these fellers sot down. I want
                  em to onderstand that Ime a sojer and a gentman, and not a pollytickle pimp. Jest
                  say so, ef you please, in a conspeckuous place in your collumes.
               And now as this epistol hes ben so far rather of a grave karrickter, I will wind
                  up with a joak that my frend and pitcher, the Admirable Abe, got off this morning
                  as, he was handin me, pinch of snuff.
               "D. V.," ses he, tatppin the lid of the box that contained the pungent-mixter, with a sourdastick smiled, "why is
                  snuffin like praying?"
               I sirrenderd without an effort, upon witch he indicated that snuffing was like
                  prayin bekase it brort a man to his sneeze.
               
               On refleckrshin you will diskiver the pint—but it takes time to see it. Leavin the
                  larf entirely to you, when you find out whar it cums in, I remain in a state of
                  kullaps,
               
                  Yours allus,

                  [We recommend the subjoined letter from our trustwrorthy and patriotic
                     correspondent to the thoughtful perusal of our readers. It is at once grave and
                     gay, lively and severe. Above all, it is reliable. At a time when it is but too
                     clear that the majority of the Washington letter-writers draw exclusively upon
                     their imaginations for their facts, the simple and earnest truthfulness of our
                     venerable friendly will be appreciated by the public. It has been proposed to

                  ALEXANDRY, VIRGINNY, October 24, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Mrs. Ginral Maclellin is onderstood to hev left the army of the Potomac bekase she
                  found it too kwiet, and Her Eggsellency Mrs. Lincoln hes gon North in sairtch of a
                  littel hulsum eggsightment to releve the mannotany of Washington life. Solem
                  repose rains in the War and Navy Department, and barrin the Treshury, where the
                  Seckatry is continnally chased by guvernment creditors ankshuus to raise the wind,
                  a deliteful cam prevales, witch peers likely to last ontil the vernal equal nocks.
                  It is sed that on Mrs. Lincoln's return to the seat of Government we air to hev a
                  coarse of theaytrickles at the Presidenshil Pallas, in which sevral distingwishit
                  pursonagres will take pairt. In a peeryud of perfound trankwillity like the
                  Present, sum littel artifishal steamalus raaly seems reckwisit. The fust peace
                  will be "A New Way to Pay Old Dets", in witch Seckatry Blare will take the roll of
                  Sir Giles Overreach, the princypal mail carrickter, a tenayshus old feller, who
                  delivers his remarkabul finanshil news to the awjence in an incoherent manner with
                  menny stomps. The interlood is to be Bamboastes Furiosy, with the Seckatry of War
                  for the hero, but on ackount of the present skarsity of shoos in the army of the
                  Potomac, the boots will be omitted. The hull to wind up with Rip Van Winkle, in
                  witch the Seckatry of the Navy hes kindly consented to enact Rip, and it is thort
                  his Sleepy Holler seen will be wonderfully troo to nater. Instead of the Flying
                  Dutchman the pirit ship Alabammer will be interdooced with raal fire. The
                  Seekatries of State and the Treshery dekline to face the musick as pufformers, but
                  Mr. Seward will act as stage manager, and Mr. Chase will giv out the checks. As
                  the army is eggspected to go inter quarters shortly, thar will no doubt be a large
                  milentary attendance. The, proceeds is to be infested in swoords, of honor to be
                  presented to the princypul struttygists of the age.
               The President and me are dooin wot we ken to save the Union, but as he trooly
                  observes, its like the labor of Sissyfuss—a fabalus feller as is engaged in the
                  uphill work of rollin a big stun tip a mounting, witch is continally returnt on
                  his hands, so thart it mounts to within arter all. We did spose that the Seccesh
                  was so effeckshally chawfed up by Uncle Sam at the battle of Aunteatem that afore
                  the, winter commenst thar wouldent be a grease pot left on em, But it peers the
                  misabull cusses doosent appreshiate a lickin; they jest take it, and walk off
                  singin "Dixie", leavin us to berry thar ded. Sum thinks its takin too much
                  gunpowder in thar rum as blinds em to thar own discomforter. Ennyhow, the more we
                  thrash em the less they seem inclinaed to acknolledge the corn. Decisive victries
                  doosent help us a might. The mane difficulty on our side peers to be want of
                  troops. We haint got mutch over three hunderd thousand men in Virginny and
                  Merryland, and re-enforcements oney arrives at the rate of three thousand a day;
                  consekently it is nessary for our ginrals to stand strickly on the defensiv and use the utmost precawshins to prevent a
                  supprise, and gard agen an invashin of the North.
               Setch is the opinyun of sum of our leadin milentary stars; altho the
                  onderstrappers of the rank and file doosent agree with the shoulderstrappers in
                  cummand, on these pints. Onder these delikit suckemstances, the President and me
                  is not prepared to decide the kwestin whether the rebels ken or ken not be
                  summerally disposed of afore the winter sets in. In the meantime, we reckymend the
                     vox populie to keep cool while the draft is in progress, and
                  go to the poles in November with the fire of paytryitism burnin in thar harts, and
                  a firm determinashin to play hob with the enemees of the Administrashin. Conker we
                  must in the eend. It is oney a kwestin of time, for, as the poick ses: 
                     
                        "A shindy, when its wunst begun
                        Bekweethed from rathy sire to son,
                        By sumboddy is allus wun—
                        Onless both parties cut and run."
                     
                   Also— 
                     
                        "Truth crusht to airth her legs regains,
                        The everlastin 'ears air hers,
                        But ef you nock out Error's brains,
                        They're of no more use'n a grasshopper's."
                     
                  
               
               The buv kwoted standsirs is by the upright and inspired editor of the Evenin Post,
                  and peers to me to meet the case eggsackly. I no peeple call him an abelishinest
                  bekase he admires Uncle Tom's Cabin, and rit a pome called "Than-a-Topseys," but
                  he tells hum truths in black and white, and bein sumthin of a poick myself, I luck
                  upon him as man and a bruther."
               The exemplery Abraham and me hes lied rayther a jolly time senst the amabul and
                  eggsellent lady of the Manshin hes ben on her Nuthern tower. The mungoheeler hes
                  ben out of the corner cubbard freckwently, and I hev drunk her helth in whiskey
                  punch doorin her absens with great aciduity. My illustrus frend hes no taste for
                  punch, so I allus adjudycate his sheer to myself, and I find the dubble doste
                  considerbully lightens the keers of state, and also helps me to comprehend his
                  remarkabul cannondrums. When a man sees dubble its eesier for him to see inter a
                  dubble-intender. As we were settin in his sanktum last evenin, discussin the
                  properiety of sendin out wun of the fast beef boats to luck arter rebel
                  priviteers, he axed me why Cappen Semmses vessel was shoor to cum to a bad eend. I
                  shuck my hed, signifyin it beat my time, upon witch he remarkt that Cappen Semmses
                  vessel was shoor to cum to a bad eend bekase 290 allus ended in naught. He also
                  perpounded the follerin:
               "Why was Semmses cruze arter the whaler Ocmulgee like the story of the Widder's
                  Cruze?"
               I backed down agen, when he informt me confidenshelly that it was bekase the
                  result was a vessel full of ile.
               Sum may call this flippant; but I find it plesant to hev the dull rootin of
                  bizness releved by setch flashes of saytire.
               The President rekwests me to say semmi-offishusly that we shall save the kentry
                  atween us, ef thars enny save to it, and belevin thats its in us to do it, I
                  remain, modestly,

                     and we are quite willing to give him the opportunity to state them; but it must

                  ALEXANDRY, VIRGINNY, October 30, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The Army of the Potomac hes got its shoos and sum peeple thinks it ougher to be
                  puttin its best foot foremost. Lee and Longstreet air retreatin, and ef they fool
                  away thar time on the road to Richmound and Maclellins regaird for his sojers
                  corns doosent pervent a forced march in thar new high-lows, you may andizzypate a
                  fight purty recently. But as new lether is apt to dror the feet and corn salve is
                  sed to be gettin skarse in the Union ranks, a ginral forrard moovement may
                  possably be postponied until arter the result of the November eleckshins is known.
                  I bleve this is the opinyun of Dr. Zacharie and uther imminent shyrapidists, and
                  they oughter no. Wunderful! isent it, on wot seaming trifuls the most important
                  events depends. In Edin it was frute; in Virginny its lether. In the meantime a
                  Commishin hes ben appinted to report on a plan to put Washington in setch a state
                  of defence as 'll pervent its bein tuck by storm. Ef we kant bag Richmound, we
                  musent let the owdashus rebels sack the Nayshinal Capital.
               
               The war peers to be prosecuted with vigger in the lyal States. By way of
                  stimulatin the paytryitism of the Merrylanders, kwite a number of Union men hev
                  ben supprised and made prisners in the streets of Bawltomore. Thar offense was a
                  new speeches of Treasen—of which fresh varities, hithertoo onknown, is developt
                  evry day. The latest stile is douting the infallability of Major-Ginral Wool; and
                  as that distingwished Trojan hes no dout on the subjeck hisself, he has siezed the
                  douters and made em prisners of war. It is not troo, howsever, that he hes hed his
                  milentary hat hung on the oblesk in Monament Squar, and rekwired evry citysin to
                  stop and saloot it, onder pain of a rest. That story is a liebil, got up by sum of
                  the high old seecesh simperthisers as inhabits that lowcality.
               The President and Me doosent alltogether approov of Ginral Wool's perceedins; and
                  the individyals as was rash enuff to kwestin his capacity will be payroled to-day.
                  We nuther of us agree with the Seckatry of War, as to the best method of puttin
                  down the rebellyun. He goes in for enforcin marshil lor and makin prisners of war
                  in the lyal North; while we air in favor of confinin them kinder operashins to the
                  rebellyus South. Howsever, we shell let him hev his swing ontil the suvrins hes
                  eggspressed thar vews, nex week, at the poles. Ef they side with us, he will
                  probly retire from public life to that cam obskewrity witch his talents and his
                  virtoos is so well calkilated to adorn. Should this be the case, I shall advise
                  the President to proclaim a ginral jail delivry of pollytickle prisners in the
                  Nuthern cities, and the re-establishment of the Union as it was, in all the Free
                  States. Ef New York and New England goes with Pennsylvany, Ohio and Indianny, agin
                  the suspenshin of have his carcase and Provost Marshils and
                  setch, the President will consider it an indicashin that the masses is opposed to
                  Constitooshinal Libty on the Austrean plan, and act accordinly. My illustrus frend
                  ses he is willin to be gided by the will of the peeple as spessified throo the
                  ballot box. Tharfore, Bully for him! Its time it was bully for him; for he's ben
                  bullid long enuff, and would be yet, mebbe, ef it warnt for me. Not as I claim eny
                  merit on that ackount, for its as nateral to me to help the weak as it is for a
                  duck to swim.
               In the absens of the President's amabul consort and air a parent, I am more with
                  him than ever, and in fack spend as much time at the White House as I do acrost
                  the river. The Cabnet doosent like it of coarse, and the Seckatry of War, who is
                  remarkabul for his tenassity of porpus, wurks agent me night and day. But its no
                  use. A donkey-engine mought as well try it on with a fust-class high-presshur
                  locomotive. I hev taken a solem oath to see the honest paytryit throo the crysis,
                  and I'll stick to him like a postage-stamp.
               We tuck a drive together yestday as far as Bladensbug, and renewed our vows of
                  fidelity on the road—fidelity to wun anuther, the emansipayshin proclamashin, and
                  the Constitooshin. Espeshally the Constitooshin, witch we red over as we went
                  along, in order to hev it at our fingers eends. Cumming back over the slashes, the
                  President eggsprest a positiv determinashin to cut the —— party. The space I hev
                  left blank was reely a blank in our conversashin; his eggslency pausin at the word
                  "the," and winking as far as "party." I may state confidenshally, howsever, that
                  the manner in witch the vakinsy is to be filled up, depends on the results of nex
                  weeks eleckshins.
               Thars considabul bettin here on the Guvner's tickets, both in your State and
                  Massachusetts. Menny air offerin yaller stamps to blue on Seymour; and on the
                  uther hand, I onderstand the Honabul Gid, of the navy, hes sworn never to cut his
                  baird or his top-not till Wadsworth is inaugerated at Albany. In Bawltomore the
                  odds agen Guvner Andrews is an octoroon to a spool of cotton.
               The Members of the Cabnet, taken as a boddy, wears a wilted aspeck, as ef they
                  dident sleep well nights. You ken see sirkils round thar eyes like the rings round
                  the planet Satan, oney redder; and Mr. Chase peels to hev got a new rinkle evry
                  time I meet him. The President is screen. By my advice he replies to all kwestins
                  from his constitooshinal advisers in cannondrums and pairables, and will continny
                  to do so ontil the will of the peeple is clarly known. Then he will open his head
                  and proclaim a new proclamashin.
               With three cheers for the Union, the Constitooshin, free speech and a free press,
                  I remain, onder sum eggsightment,

                  ALEXANDRY, VIRGINNY, November 7, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Peers to me I menshint in my last epistol that the President hed intermated a
                  detarminashin to cut loose from wun of the grate pollytickle parties as divides
                  the kentry; but declined takin his chice ontil arter the New York eleckshin. Wal,
                  the time hes arrove to make his seleckshin, but he still hangs in suspense, like
                  the Sircoffergus of Mayhumit atwixt the two magnates at Medinah. In the wurds of a
                  Greek poick, "How happy could he be with ether were tuther deer charmer away". To
                  be sure the Empire State hes skreemed purty loud, and Abelishin seems to hev
                  founderd in a white squall in that rein. But then the Pilgrim Commonwelth hes gin
                  the Conservatives a black mark, and pintin to her two cradles of Libty, Funnel
                  Hall and the Plymuth Blarney Stun, she continnees to go for Unkel Sam and Unkel
                  Tom, wun and invincible. Thars a cupple of depitashins on here at present on the
                  nigger bizness, and they eenamost bullyrag my illustrus fiend to deth. Wun of the
                  deligashins is from your sitty, tuther from Bosting, and they take thar turns at
                  his Eggsellency, ride and tic. The New York consarn wants the Cabnet smasht, the
                  gentmen from the Modern Aythens doosent. Strange to say, Messrs. Seward, Stanton,
                  Chase, Welles, Smith, and Blare goinsides with the gentmen from the Modern
                  Aythens. I onderstand, on the uther hand, that sum of the leadin Democrats in your
                  sitty is willin to forego the frutes of thar late suckcess in order to help the
                  President outer his diffickulties. Fernandy Wood is reddy to throw up his seat in
                  Congress ef his well-known finanshil talons is needed in the Treshury; and
                  Benjamin, his paytryit bruther, would be ekwilly magnannymous, ef wanted in the
                  Navy Department—whar his trends think his long eggsperience in the distribushin of
                  prizes mought be bennyfishal to the sarvis. Ime not a Democrat myself, but oney a
                  pollytishin at large, as votes on prenceple; but I kant help regardin them two
                  nobul bruthers with unsofisticated admirashin, and I congratlate the commershill
                  emporium, throo your collumes, on heving put em throo. Ginral Wallbridge is a
                  frend of mine. I regaird him as a brick and a bruther; and ef enny man of smaller
                  calibeer than B. Wood hed beaten him, I should hev felt bad; but Wood was formed
                  by nater for a poplar idle, and I sed so years ago, when he was oney a little
                  shaver.
               Torkin of poplar idles, I spose an admirin and confidin nashin eggspecks the
                  modern Father of his Kentry to take sum decided meshers in consekens of the late
                  eleckshins. Let the kentry keep cool. Its devoted Father is at present in cawcuss
                  with hisself and Me, and we event yet taken a vote on the kwestins at issoo. We
                  want to do things up as smooth as possabul. Wots the use of hevin an all-wulfy row
                  in the ranch, ef we ken arrive at the desired eend without a shindy? We hed an
                  interestin conversashin on the subjeck this mornin, hed the Payter
                     Patry and Me. Ses he:
               "D. V., mebbe Stanton 'll abdikate."
               "Honerd rooler of an enlitend peeple," ses I, "did you ever hunt possums?"
               He nodded aguessence.
               "Bekase ef you hev," I continned, "you must hev notist that the critter's amayzin
                  tenayshus of his holt. I wunst treed wun up a big persimmon, whar he sot perched
                  at his ees, devourin the goldin frute in fancid sekewrity. I shuck that persimmon
                  ontil the persperashin pored off me at evry jerk like water from a shower bath.
                  Wun by wun the varmint's limbs gin out onder the shocks, till finerly he hung by a
                  single leg, and I thort I hed him. I made anuther grand effort, and shuck that leg
                  off too, when darn my picter ef he dident ketch onto a branch by his tail, and
                  thar he swung and grinned at me! Its my bleef that an airthquake wouldent hev
                  shuck down that possum."
               "Wal," ses the gifted Abe, with a moanful attempt at jokelarity, "I spose you
                  summond a possum commitatus of neybers to help you shake."
               "Nary commitatus," I replide.
               "Wot did you do then?" he axed, impayshently.
               "Wal," ses I, significantly, "I jest cut the tree from onder the
                     possum!"
               But we shant take that coarse with the pollytickle possums in the Cabnet persimmon
                  tree ontil milder meens hes ben eggsausted. At present we air tryin to cokes em
                  down with temptin tid-bits, setch as Rushin and Brittish plenipenitentiaryships,
                  Supreme Courtships, and cetery, but they continny to hold on to thar elevated
                  persishins, aperiently considerin a berth in hand wurth two in prospeck. I wunst
                  herd a lecterer on nateral fillosofy say thar was a wunderftl prenceple in nater
                  called the Attrackshin of Coheshin. Gess it pervales to a normus degree in Cabnet
                  offsirs.
               Ef the present incumbrants was oney outer the way, the President and Me could fill
                  thar places in hafe an hour. Our progranmy is allreddy drord out, and contanes the
                  very best the market affords. The bill of fare consests of Dix, Holt, Banks, Reverdy Jonson, Governor Moroton, and a
                  few more of the same sort, and in order to avide invidius distinkshins, we prepose
                  to let em raffle for chice of offises. It is thort boy sum (but not by me) that
                  the present heads of departments will drap gracefully from thar places, afore
                  Congress meets. Most sartainly, ef they don't, the tree oughrter be cut from
                  wonder em. The President is payshent—so am I; but thar air limickss to human
                  eganimity;; and ef the Cabnet won't resign, we may hev to put em out in the
                  cold.
               In spite of thar corns, aggravated by the new brogans, the unconkerable legions of
                  the Union continnees to advance in a parallel line with the countless hosts of the
                  ragged and ravenus foe; but as pairadlel lines never meets, no collushin is likely
                  to occur from this splended strutegic moovment, witch will no dout eggsite the
                  wunder and admirashin of Europe. Whenever ether party make a tack tordls tuther,
                  thar'll be a fight or a foot race; but wether seteh an act of desperashin will
                  ever take place, is at present an open krwestin with

                  ALEXANDRY, VIRGINNY, November 14, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Giding a President as is beseeged without enny let up wotsumdever, by the
                  all-hungreyest, all-selfishest, all-sassiest drove or pollyticle intriggers that
                  ever besot an onest rooler, is, upon the hull, rayther an aggernizin amewsment. I
                  hev lost uppards of twenty pounds of flesh senst I threw the wait of the
                  inflewence inter the eggseggative scale. I wunst red in a little buck call
                  Lacon—rit, ef I am not mistakin, the Prentiss of the Louisvil vil
                     Jernil—that grate men was like torches as consoomed tharselves
                  to enliten mankind. Bnt wots the use of consoomin yerself ef it all eends in
                  smoke? I don't see as the seeds of wisdum, I drap continually inter my
                  distingwished pupil's ears perdooces mutch of a crop. Not as I meen to insinawait
                  that they fall on barrin sile, but Ime afeard the tares and thorns and blamed
                  paristickle plants of this cussed pollytickle jungle chokes em down, and spiles
                  the prospeck of a hulsum harvest. Eenamost all the individyals as gains axess to
                  the President hes axes to sharpin, and menny of the old party hacks suckseeds in
                  perswadin him that thar idees is fust chop for the Union, when thar oney objeck is
                  to block out sumthin cumfurtabul for tharselves. On this ackount, I want to set
                  myself right with my kentrymen throo your collumes. Standin in the persishin I do
                  afore the nashin, my head allreddy kiverd with silvery fibers, and eggspectin to
                  bequeeth the fabric of my fame to the futur as a hairloom from witch poicks and
                  hisstoryuns will weave thar morril responsabul for all the misstakes of my
                  paytriarkal frend and cotrumpery. Not as I distrust for a moment for his good
                  intenshins; but his hart is saft, and his vennabul head symperthises with it.
               Ses I to his Eggslensy, immediently arter the New York eleckshin; We must smash
                  the Cabnet (hear in mind, I sed the Cabnet, not the
                     Constituooshin), and reconstruck. He smiled in the affirmative.
                  Ses I, in continiashin, the Onterrified hes nockt the mencipayshinests cold, and
                  bein masters of the sitiwation, they hev a right to be represented in offis. He
                  agreed to the observashin with a wink. Besides, ses I, the fienanshil meshurs of
                  the Administrashin doosent soot the publick, and evry boddy is as mad as hornets
                  at bein stuck with Blare's all-cussed stickin plasters. He nodded a cent to the
                  propersishin, and added that he hed allus looked on Blare as a square-dealin man;
                  but ef he was of a diffrent stomp, he wouldent adhere to him enny longer. Finerly,
                  we agreed to ship the hull boodle of Constituooshinal advisers, and emply a new
                  set, whoos names I gin you in my last epistol. I sposed it was all settled; but a
                  passel of ultree-Abelishinists got around my nobul payrun, and auuried him util
                  his spinal collume began to saften. Fust, he consented to hev Maclellin remooved.
                  I dont say wether he was right or rong; but I do say, the thing warnt dun in the
                  right way. The act was too suddent. It lucked too mutch like party sperrit; and
                  thar warn't suffishent resins assined for it. I told the Presi- dent so to his face—for Ime squar as a brick, and
                  keer no more for party pollyticks than I do for Jo Smith's Goldin Bible. But he
                  only srugged his sholders, as mutch as to say, needs must wen the devil drives.
                  Translatin the moovment en that light, I couldent help sayin that I wisht we hed a
                  Cheef Madgistrit as keered nuther for man nor devil when he thought he was 0.
                  K.
               Then I axed him about changin the Cabnet; and it peered from wot he sed, that ef
                  the present incumbrants was sacked, he would hev to put the bluest kinder hull-hog
                  mansipayshinists in thar places. I wanted to know why our oridjinal programmy
                  couldent be carrid out. Upon witch, he gin anuther hitch to his sholders, as ef to
                  intermate that the outside preshur onto him was too great. Then I venterd to hint
                  that even in down-trodden England, when the peeple voted agin the administrashin,
                  the ministers resined, and a batch with vews direckly oppersit stept inter thar
                  boots. He replid that he had hinted as mutch to the constitooshinal advisers, but
                  they indignantly remarkt that Great Briton was our nateral enemee, and it would be
                  degradin to the American carrickter to foller Brittish presidents and
                  eggsamples.
               I larn from the papers—for Ime not on speakin terms with the War Department—that
                  simontanusly with Maclellin's remooval, Freemount was orderd to report for dooty.
                  I should a thort we'd hed enuff of that milentary failur in Missoora and the
                  mountin department of Virginny; but I reckin Stanton's goin to giv him and that
                  sellybrated boddy-gard of his'n anuther chanst. Wun thing's sartain, namely: ef
                  thar charges doosent hev mutch effeck on the enemee, they will on the treshury. A
                  more weak and embezzele act than the revival of Freemount & Co. I never heerd
                  on. I gin the amabul Abraham my opinyun on the subjeck, and told him that I
                  considerd it would be a radical error to put the Pathfinder on the war path onder
                  present suckemstances; to witch he replide, with a farseeshus twinkel of his
                  commic eye, that radical errors was so commun that wun or two more or less would
                  skarsly be notist, This mornin I inkwired of him ef enny ondertakin for overtakin
                  the pirit Semmes was onder way; to witch he responded by makin a jester with his
                  right thum over his left sholder; so I spose that godless buckunear will continny
                  to pray upon our commerce onmislested. As to the vessels that hes ben dispatched
                  to ketch him so far, its ben purty mutch like sendin tubs arter a whale.
               Alltogether, I feel discurridged, and hev hed sum thorts of leavin the Father of
                  his Kentry to row his hoe by hisself. But thar's so mutch good inter him, I dont
                  like to do it. Mebbe he'll straiten hisself arter a while, and, with my
                  assistance, giv the pickthanks as besets him a lofty fall. Hopin setch may be the
                  case, I remane, constitooshinally,
               
                  Yours allus,

                  [It is a pleasant tribute to the straightforward honesty of purpose which
                     characterizes our veteran correspondent, that he should have been consulted by
                     the President as to the tenor of the Message. His allusion to the matter in the
                     following communication is marked by the modesty with which he always speaks of

                  ALEXANDRY, VIRGINNY, November 21, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The Prence de John Veal's refleckshins on the conduck of the war, translated from
                  the French langwidge, hes perdooced kwite a sensashin here. My paytryotic paytrun,
                  the President, told me yestday in a confidenshil way, with a rizzable eggspreshin
                  in his high old classick visedge, that he was glad to see John Veal was more
                  inklined to do us justis than John Bull. But the administrashin ginally doosent
                  like the fooliton of the Prence, thar prenceple objeckshin bein
                  that it hints at a dispersishin on thar parts to fool it on the ockashin of
                  Maclellin's late advance acrost the Peninslur.
               Honabul Charles A. Daney, who was regarlarly brort up to the milentary perfeshin
                  in the Triboon offis, and hes jest ben appinted Depity Seckatry of War on that
                  ackount, is perfeckly disgusted with the Prence's stricters. He is sed to be
                  preparin an anser witch will ockapy three to four thousand foolio pages, and may
                  possably appeer arter the conclushin of the war, as a seequill to the New American
                  Ensicklypedy. Mr. Daney hes a fine milentary mind and considabul baird. His wurk
                  will go down to posteriority. It was his misfortin to leve the
                     Triboon, bekase his attacts on Maclellin was rayther too loud
                  for the responsabul eddytur; but that is no disporridgement to his merits in the
                  eyes of most of the Cabnet.
               
               Ginral Freemount hes ben on here, and hes had sevral privit intervews with the
                  distingwished Constitooshinal Adviser at the head of the War Department. Report
                  ses he is to sooperintend the ereckshin of fortyficashins on Coney Island, and
                  uther cummandin pints at the entrance to your harbor, for witch Congress is
                  eggspected to appropriate a few millyuns of the large surplush at present remainin
                  in the Nayshinal Treshery. Ginral Freemount is formed by nater and eggsperience
                  for this importent trust. Bildin is his fort. See wot he dun in the Southwest!
               I larn, semmi-offishusly, that the Honabul Giddyun (familyarly known as the
                  Ainshent Marriner and the Old Man of the Sea) entertains a lively bleef that the
                  pirit steamer Alabammer will be tuck in a few days. Hes the Vanderbilt, witch hes
                  ben layin in wait for her at New York so long, started in pershoot; and is that
                  the ground of his andizzypashins? Ever senst Semmes sent wurd by a capterd
                  skipper, that as sun as his pressing engagements left him leeshur for reckreashin
                  he ment to steam up throo the Narrers, and pitch a few shells from his
                  hunderd-pounder at Trinity Church and the City Hall, the Seckatry of the Navy hes
                  ben on the luckout for him in that kwarter. Feelin bitter at the disappintment of
                  his hops, and becummin sensabul that it was no use keepin the swiftest steamer in
                  the wurld at anker in the North River to entrap the bold buckunear, he hes probly
                  sent her out cruzin in the lower bay, whar she will no doubt giv a good ackount of
                  the privitear when she cums acrost it.
               It is rummerd here that the Honabul Giddyun hes changed his vews in regaird to
                  Stevenses Battery, and that that remarkabul wurk of art is to be finisht without
                  delay and sent up the Conneticut River to defend the City of Hartford, witch, in
                  consekens of its hevin ben formally the residens of the Seckatry of the Navy, and
                  the place whar his marrytime genus was developt and matoored, is sposed to be
                  markt out for speshil vengens by the owdayshus Semmes. It is a butiful trait in
                  the carrickter of Mr. Welles that he is thus regairdful of the place whar his
                  risin talons was fosterd, and that his promoshin from the mail sarvice to the
                  manidgement of the reglar Navy hesent interfeerd with his hum assosiashins.
               The Constitooshinal Advisers, as a ginral thing, is purty bizzy making reddy for
                  the meetin of Congress. Seckatry Chase—when not onavideably engaged in shinning
                  for small loans—is industrusly implide in figgerin out his Annual Report. It will
                  be an abel argument in faver of the idee that a currency cumposed eggscloosively
                  of rags, lampblack and sap green is preferabul abul on ackount of its buty,
                  porterbility, and the small cost of produckshin, to the preshus trash, grubbed at
                  setch a nonnus eggspense outer the bowels of the airth, for finanshil porpuses. It
                  is sed by Mr. Chase's friends that he will make this so clar that all the banks
                  will immediently see it and return at wunst to speshee payments, with the objeck
                  of gettin rid of thar gold and silver as a useless incumbrence. Mr. Chase is a
                  nice man for a small party—the ultra abelishin party, frinstance.
               The President and me hes ben a good deal together lately. We air fixin up the
                  Messidge. It will be a dockyment of sum lenth; fur a state paper, the consekenses
                  of witch air eggspected to reech far inter the futur, kant be skweedged inter a
                  nutshell. Still, we intend, ef possabul, to keep it down to sevin or eight
                  columes; but it may reech nine or ten. Thars oney wun thing cunsarnin the Messidge
                  that me and my lofty-minded coadjewter doosent agree about. He wants to take all
                  the responsability of the dooins of the Constitooshinal Advisers onto his own
                  sholders, while my advice is to let all offishal tubs stand on thar own bottums.
                  We shell crack up the mancipayshin projeck, and giv anuther corjal invitashin to
                  the Rebel States to lay down thar arms, hyst the Flag of the Free, and save thar
                  niggers. The colornizashin skeem will also be agin tutched upon; for when it cums
                  to capterin fore hunderd waggin-loads of "a man and a bruther" at wun hawl, it
                  becums nesessary, in the coarse of human events, to consider serusly wot is to be
                  dun with fore millyuns of our cullerd feller-men and relashins, ef they should
                  happin to be thrown on our hands in a lump, by the conkwest of the South.
               We shell keep the Messidge open to the last moment, in case the capter of
                  Richmound or the Alabammer, or enny uther great event, setch as the army goin
                  inter winter-kwarters; frinstance, should cum off at the leventh hour. I could
                  tell you menny astonishin things in relashin to pollytickle matters here; but it
                  would be a breech of confidens. I may obsarve, howsever, that a crysis is
                  eminent.

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, November 28, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Washingtin is fillin up faster'n a Philadelfy Stashin-house arter a firemen's
                  fight. Publick pickpockits and pollytickle incinderies is as thick as flies in a
                  molasses cask and twiste as lively. The swell mob of corntractors as hev made thar
                  piles, with thar fammalies rigged out arter the latist Payris fashin plates, and
                  jeweld up to the nines, is dooin the peacock and butterfly bizness to an eggstent
                  that takes the shine outer all the furrin Plenipenitentiaries and thar soots; and
                  a new set of paytryotic Jeremy Diddlers, as hungry as seventeen year lowcusses as
                  hes jest chipt thar shells, is huverin around the public offisis in hops of makin
                  a raid on the greenbacks. Judgin from the morril aspeck of the majority of the
                  kumpany arrivin, I should say we air likely to hev a high old swindlin sesshin. Ef
                  the nashin is saved, it will be regairdless of eggspense. It is curius, but true,
                  that the biggest theeves hes the most to say about presarving the integrity of the
                  Union.
               You will hev lamed afore this reeches you that me and the President hes ben
                  rayther too mutch for the Seckatry of War. When I writ last, I hed jest receeved a
                  note from a frend in the war offis statin that the Honabul C. A. Daney, late
                  professor of milentary literatoor in the Tryboon Pollytecnick Academy, was
                  appinted Deppity Seckatry. Shortly arter dispatchin my letter, howsever, I
                  diskivered the informashin was prematoor; but that ef the President dident
                     object, the Honabul C. A. D. would take his place in the Administrashin
                  Line on the follerin day. I seen the modern Sinsinatus in his sanktum at the White
                  House that arternoon, and Mr. Daney hesent ben appinted. He ses he dosent keer
                  about bein Assistant-Seckatry. Mebbe not. Nevertheless you ken put down his
                  elevashin amung the axidents that mought hev happend, ef the Providence as shapes
                  our eends hedn't nockt him eendways. But in sayin that me and the President hed
                  ben rayther too much for the high minded and benevolent funkshinary at the head of
                  the War Department, I referd mainly to the order for the liberashin of State
                  prisners arrested without caws and held contrary to law, justis and humanity
                  inanity. When the thing was sot in the right light afore the Seckatry it was too
                  much for his felines. No dout he is a kindharted man at the bottom, when you git
                  to it. His better natur was apeeled to in this style.
               "Mr. Stanton, you ken librate those onfortnit captyves or rap yourself up in the
                  solitood of your own oridginality and retire, with the thanks of a grateful
                  kentry, to the shades of private life."
               He couldn't stand it. His eye glistend, his baird shuck with emoshin, his genrus
                  spirit relented, and he eggsclamed in axcents of the deepest paythos:
               "I am not made of iron. Open the Barsteels!"
               And he dun it. The prisners hes all ben oncaged, barrin one or twa as hedent
                  payshents to wait for this triump of filanthropy, and died in jail. I hope the
                  Seckatry's clemency will never be forgotten, and as a mark of the gratitood of the
                  peeple, I prepose that two stattoos of him be made outer bronze, at the public
                  cost, and put over the gateways of Fort Warren and Fort Laugheryet. When he
                  retires from the Cabnet—witch he may afore long—he oughter hev a furrin mishin. Ef
                  the President was to nominate him for Austree, the Sennit would, no doubt, confirm
                  the appintment.
               The messidge is compleat all but the figgers and facts from the Honabul Salmon P.,
                  and a brief flurrish at the openin and the tail eend, which will be very pius and
                  affectin. We calkilate to hev the dockyment reddy for the prenter's hands by
                  to-morrer evenin, ef Seckatry Chase ken make up his mind wot the publick det is,
                  atween this and then. He finds, as the statements cum in from the diffrent
                  burrows, that the sum totil is likely to eggseed his late ekinomical estimit of
                  640 millyuns to an all-startlin degree. I persoom, howsever, that the nayshin will
                  be let off purty cheap on paper, as tellin the trooth might create an onnessary
                  panic in the Stock Markit besides razing the premum on gold.
               Welles hes finisht his shippin list, but will keep it opin to the last possabul
                  moment in order to menshin the rival of the Alabammer in port as a prize, ef his
                  sangwinary hops of her immedient capter by the Vanderbilt should be relized. Thar
                  air sevral rummers afloat in naval sirkils here, as to her present warabouts. Wun
                  akount places her off the Coste of Maine, while anuther ses that she's cruzin at
                  the mouth of the Conneticut with the idee of, ketchin the Seckatry of the Navy on
                  his way hum to his Thanksgivin dinner at Hartford. It is the Honabul Giddyun's opinyun howsever, that she's
                  layen off and on sumwhars atwixt Cape May and the Straits of Baffleman.
               The Honabul Edwin B. is understood to hev got as far as Fredericksbug in his
                  report of the sucksesses of the Union arms; but thar he sticks for the present,
                  waitin late advices from Burnside, and positive informashin as to the present
                  latitood and longitood of Stunwall Jackson.
               Seward is throo with his yarn, witch is a State paper highly flatterin to the
                  nayshinal pride; showin how thurrowly we out-ginrald Lord John Russill in the
                  Trent affair, and magnannymously gin up Mason and Slidell, bekase they warn't wuth
                  thar keep, and we was all-fired glad to get rid on 'em. As evrybody is aware that
                  the Honabul William H. twisted Russill round his finger and compleatly got to
                  windward of Pamerstun, this dockyment, abel as it is, will not eggsight much
                  curosity.
               The Inteeryur hes ben dun up neatly and consisely by Mr. Smith, who 'tends
                  strickly to his own bizness, and is tharfore, not considered of mutch ackount by
                  his coadjewters whoos vews is more comprehensive and ginral.
               Mr. Blare, who is a man of no ornary stamp, hes bed his post offis report reddy
                  for sum days. It is said that it reckymends a redempshin of the gumbacks with the
                  greenbacks, but this is not sartin. A delegashin of the New York apple wimmen is
                  on here in relashin to the matter, but I have not heerd whether they hev hed an
                  entervew with the P. M. Ginral.
               I notis it is stated in wun of the New York jernils that the mancipayshin projeck
                  is to be moddified in the Messidge. Please give this report a flat denial. We
                  shall not take back a hiotah of the Proclamashin. The President and me hes but wun
                  idee—"the greatest good of the gratest number", without distinkshin of culler or
                  flavor. Union and Libty, or Union and Slavery, its all the same to us so its
                  Union. Freely and ekwilly,

                     length. Of course, he has not a particularly sharp eye for-its demerits. People

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, December 5, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Wot do you think of the messidge? Does it meet your vews of a Union-savin yarn? Ef
                  so, please give it a fust rate notis, with a few eggstracks from the passidges
                  relatin to the yolk of slavery, onder your "Locul Missellany" head, and oblege the
                  President and Me. The fack is, it hes ben most onriteusly walkt inter by evrybody,
                  evrywhars. The Conservativs say its radical, and the Radicals swar its
                  conservativ. And yet Eddyturs, as troo as Ime a Sojer and a Statesman, we tried to
                  consillyate both. We recognized the ebony speeches as pursenal property to tickle
                  the misgided millyuns in arms agen the Guvernlent, and deklard slavery to be the
                  soul caws of the rebellyun, to satisfy the abelishinists. We proposed to postpony
                  mancipayshin for thirty-seven years, to gratify South Caroliny and Georgy, and we
                  went in wunst more for the abelishin of human bondidge in all the bellyregent
                  States at New Years, to propishiate Conneticut and Massachusetts. It was our
                  honest endevor to make the dockyment like the changeabul picters you see in the
                  prent-shop winders, witch presents a likeness of Wheatfield Bucannon from wun pint
                  of vew and Winfield Scott from anuther—or rather like the Dog and the Lion, in the
                  peep show, whar the specktators as hes douts consarnin the pursenal identity of
                  the animils is perlitely told by the properioter that "they pays thar munney and
                  ken take thar chice."
               Its all-cussed hard, arter tryin to please evryboddy, to find you haint pleased
                  noboddy, and that peers to be our case. We did our purtiest to hit wot the French
                  call the jest millyou, and the conskens is we air pitcht inter
                  from all sides to wunst. "Republics is ongrateful", as the Greek ginral remarkt
                  when they rested him for det, and refused to let him take the bennyfit of the
                  insolvent act. Ef you ever red old Easeup's Fabels, yot kennot fail to reckognise
                  in my illustrus frend and me the "Old Man and his Ass" of the nineteent sentry.
                  The mildest illushun to the Messidge so far, is that it is "remarkabul for its
                  simplesity", which is catamount to pernouncin it an iddyotic perduckshun.
               In my opinyun, the dockyment overfloes with ondeniable trooths. Take frinstance
                  the follerin witch the President rit with his own hand, without any subjestins on
                  my pairt:
                  
                     "It is not so easy to pay something as to pay nothing; but it is easier to
                        pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one; and it is easier to pay any
                        sum when we are able, than it is to pay it before we are able."
                  
               
               Now, thats wot I call a new rinkle in finance, and I hev no dout, when the British
                  Chanseller of the Eggschecker sees it, he will make it the baysis of a
                  propersishin to pay off the British nayshinal det, afore it becums so large as to
                  be onmanidgeable. The buty of the remark is, that it is ekwilly cutable as a motto
                  for a guverment, and as an inskripshin inside a tavern bar whar no trust is
                  given.
               Sum of the enemees of the Modern Father of his Kentry, hevin ackused him of bein a
                  short sighted pollytishin, we detarmined to disabuse the publick mind on that
                  pint, in the Messidge. Consekently, you will obsarve that we hey devoted a
                  considabul amount of stashinary to a considerashin of the affairs of the nayshin
                  from the year 1870 to 1930. I calkilate as the 251,680,914 American peeple as will
                  inhabit the United States in 1930 will feel tharselves flattered by our honabul
                  menshin of em. Our posteriority will hey to pay an all-thunderin big det of our
                  contractin, and the President and Me thort it was the least we could do to
                  soft-sope em a leetle in advance. It mought prevent em from cussin us in our
                  graves.
               Menny of the noosepapers, I notis, is sprised that the President dident compliment
                  the Army and Navy Departments on the vigger with witch the war hes ben waged on
                  land and sea, but I think the subjined sentence cut from the Messidge will
                  suffishintly ackount for the ommishin:
               "In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not
                  willingly be responsable throughout time and eternity."
               The distingwished Head of the Republick, tho a man of polisht manners, never
                  sacrifises his conshense to his perliteness. Mrs. Lincoln, as you are awar, has
                  returnt to the Presidenshil Pallas, and thar is evry prospeck of a brilyant winter
                  onder her fashinabul patternage. The illustrus lady is to Washington wot the
                  Empress Eujinny is to Payris; in fack, as the man ses in the play, "She is the
                  gloss of fashin and the mould of uniform." I may be rong in the kwotashin, but the
                  sentiment is correck.
               The privit theaytrickles I spoke of in a former letter hes not yet cum off, but as
                  the offshal yarns is purty mutch all in, I persoom the Heads of Departments is
                  reddy at enny time to abandon goose kwills and foolscap, for the sock and
                  buckskin. It is now preposed that the first peace shell be "Used Up," and the hull
                  Cabnet is to be inkluded in the cast.
               From the increasin number of army offsirs in the streets and bar rums here, I
                  persoom that a battel on the Rapperhammock may be lookt for at enny moment. Mutch
                  depends, howsever, upon the time it may take for the rebels to finnish thar
                  defenses at Fredericksbug. As sun as Lee and Longstreet is kwite prepard for a
                  shindy we shell probly go in. It is sed that the genrus and jewdishus Stanton
                  wishes em to be fully re-enforced, in order to show em how esily they ken be whipt
                  with all the odds in thar favor. The result—ef it happens—will no doubt be
                  terrably dishartnin, and prehaps eend the war with a blow. Bad wether may
                  interfere and pervent the catastrofy—but the Seckatry in coarse is not responsabul
                  for the wether Thats Heven's bizness and not hisn, as the boy remarkt when his
                  father was killed by the legtrick flewid in consekens of tyin hisself to a
                  lightnin-rod for saifty.
               Hopin you will not konsider it drogatory to your Edditoryal dignity to give the
                  Messidge a favorabul notis, I remain, and so doos the distingwisht Tenant of the

                  [The immediate cause of the sudden dash of the Army of the Potomac across the
                     Rappahannock, is fully explained in the following letter. The order to attack—a
                     positive and peremptory order—appears to have emanated from the President. Our
                     veteran correspondent was his prompter; and whatever may be the final issue of
                     the movement, he will not shirk the responsibility.—EDS.]
               
               
                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, December 12, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               At lenth the tejus paws is over, and we hev pitched inter the enemee hand ovpr
                  hand. The kentry owes the suddent dash acrost the Rapperhammock to the President
                  and me. The leathergy of the War Department (and not the want of shoos as was
                  ginrally sposed) was the sole resin why the Army of the Potomac didn't walk inter the rebels more'n two weeks ago.
                  My Illustrus Patron remonstrated agin the delay. He used the most forceabul
                  arguments he could think of—setch as "Delays is dangerous". "A stitch in time
                  saves nine", "Procrastinashin is the thief of Time", "Nuthin ventur, nuthin win",
                  and uther golden axeums from the mint of wisdum bequeethed to us by the ainshent
                  sages. But his elikwence was like purls cast afore swine. Stanton put him off with
                  invasive answers, and Halleck sent him milentary diegrams on sheets of foolscap,
                  as hed the aperience of bein made by a long-legged spider that hed jest crawled
                  outer an inkbottle.
               Things went on this way ontil last Toosday, when the President writ me a note that
                  he wanted to see me immediently on speshil bizness. He was standin on the frunt
                  door steps when I arrove at the White House, pullin his left whisker as is his
                  wont when his will is disregairded, and conduckted me at wunst to his sanktum. He
                  sed he was wurrid amazinly by the dogged obstinacy of the War Department, upon
                  witch I axed ef he wanted a peace of an honest man's mind.
               "Spit it out Old Fidelity," ses he, his feters lighten up with a hole-sold
                  smild.
               "Wal," ses I, "wot I hev to say in the first place is this. It's not so eesy to
                  lick ennyboddy as it is to lick noboddy, is it?" He remaned for a few minnits
                  absobbed in deep thort and then shuck his hed.
               "But," I continned, "its esier to lick a considabul boddy, then to lick the same
                  boddy when its twiste as considabul, isn't it?"
               Arter a breef intervil for reflexshin he concurd.
               "And," ses I resoomin again, "its esier—isn't it?—to smash horseteal boddies when
                  we air abel, than it is when they air abel to raze Cain with us."
               "D. V.," he rejined, smildin cumpleasantly, "you borrord that sillygism from a
                  remark of mine in the Messidge, and I am proud to say the logic is correck."
               "Ef so," ses I, "why in thunder don't you tell Burnside to go in and win, afore
                  the rebels sets thar airthwurks, and riful pits, and maskt batteries atwixt him
                  and Richmound, thicker'n mink traps in a Western swomp?"
               "My nobel and esteemabul friend" he responded, wipin his nose with visabul
                  emoshin," your sentiments doos honor to your head and hart; but I've gin the
                  Seckatry of War discreshinary powers."
               "Ime right glad to larn it," I remarkt sneerinly, "for its the ginral opinyun that
                  he hesn't enny of his own."
               You should hev seen the Honabul Abe lay back and shake his honest sides. It dun me
                  good to look at him.
               Hevin got him on the larf I detarmined to improov the openin.
               Ses I, solemly, "You air Cummander in Cheef of the Army and Navy of the Land of
                  the Free and the Hum of the Brave, air you not?"
               "Accordin to the Constitooshin, setch is my progative," he replied, takin his leg
                  off the arm of his cheer and drorin hisself up with nateral dignity.
               "Then," ses I, airnestly, "sail in. The Ship of State's in danger. Thar's lubbers
                  at the helium. Pitch em overboard and let you and me take the wheel alone."
               "Ah!" sithed he, in a plaintiff vice, "you want me to take the responsability; but
                  you know wot cum of that in the Macdoill affair."
               "That was onder bad advice," ses I. "Take mine."
               "State your platform and we'll see," he responded, puttin his feet on the
                  mantel-peace, "but a burnt child dreds the fire, and I've ben hauled over the
                  coals so much lately, that I don't want to put my foot in it agin."
               "Its jest this," ses I, impressivly. "Send a perumptry order to Ginral Burnside to
                  cross the Rapperhammock afore the week's over, and ef any resistance is made, to
                  lay Fredericksbug in ashes. Tell him to fight the rebels whatever they make a
                  stand; to kick struttegy to the devil, and make his way to Richmound by the
                  shortest cut at the pint of the bagnet. Tell him to foller the cumpass doo South,
                  at the dubble kwick, without pawsin to palaver on the rout, and never stop till he
                  waters his hoss in Shockoh Crick, and sees the old flag flotin over the rebel
                  capital. Do that," I exclamed, throwen myself inter his arms in a suddent bust of
                  oncontrollabul emoshin, "and you will go down to distant ages with the conshusness
                  of heving fulfilled your sakrid oblegashins to E. P. Unum and the American
                  Egul."
               The grate man was overcum by my firy energee. He sed, ef he hed as menny lives as
                  Plutark, he would be willin to giv em all for his kentry, and sot down and wrote a
                  dispatch to Burnside, arter my dicktashin—bein too mutch agitated by his
                  paytryotick felines to think for hisself.

                     NAYSIHNAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, December 19, 1862.
                     Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkcary:
                  
                  Ive ben sick. I am sick. Its on ackount of takin too mutch
                     responsability. Ime afeard the kentry will hold me ackountabul for the late
                     discomforture at Fredericksburg. Sartainly, I advised the President to order
                     Burnside to sail in; and, in dooin so, he run agin a snag. But wot could I do?
                     Halleck and Stanton bed setteld it that Richmound was to be attacted by the
                     Rapperhammock rout, and hed indooced my magnannymus frend to take a solem oath
                     on Helper's Crysis that he wouldent enterfear. In coarse he couldent perjer
                     hisself, and I was well awar that the longer we delayed goin in, the better
                     prepard the rebels would be to flax us out. It was a chice atwixt two evils,
                     and I tride to chews the leest. Ef the shindy hed ben postponied a fortnit
                     longer as was intended, our army would not oney hev ben severely wooled, but
                     utterly worsted.
                  You will reckolleck that I remarkt in my last epistol that ef it hedent ben for
                     the leathergy of the leatherheads in the War Department, our forces might hev
                     crost the river and bagged or disbursed the rebellyus hoards "weeks ago." But
                     the War Department, witch is allus forgettin sumthin, disrememberd to send the
                     pontoon bridges, and our army bein onabel, as the poick ses, to "walk the
                     waters like a thing of life", was compeld to remane with sinkin harts on the
                     rong side, while the enemee throo up thar airthwurks and prepard to vomit forth
                     a storm of fire and death onto us as sun as we began to operate. Wal, Banks was
                     off on a Quickshotic expedition to the Gulf, so thar warnt no hope of his makin
                     enny divershin to amews the enemee while Burnside pitched inter em in airnest;
                     so I thort it was best, as the mewsick hed to be faced, to face it at wunst.
                     Onder the suckemstances, wot better advice could I hev given? Ef the attact bed
                     ben put off two weeks longer, thar wouldent hev ben a grease pot left of the
                     Army of the Potomac this day.
                  The President takes the disaster with that cherfulness witch belongs to his
                     boyant nater. He thinks it is no more use to cry over spilt blood than it is to
                     cry over spilt milk, so he lucks at the affare from a farseeshus pint of
                     vew.
                  Ses I to him to-day: "Ime afeard the rebels hes got to windard of us for the
                     camppain."
                  "Yes," he replide, "and your remark subjests a cannondrum. What caused the
                     shipreck of our hopes on the Rapperhammock?"
                  "Stanton and Halleck," ses I, swarin innardly.
                  "Oridginally I grant," ses he; "but the immedient caws of the shipreck of our
                     hopes on the Rapperhammock was 'runnin on a Lee shore.'"
                  "Mister President," ses I, frownin, "I kant larf at your humor, redickllus as
                     it is—the larf is all taken outer me. Our troops is receivin checks from the
                     enemee in all direckshins."
                  "Air they?" he responded. "Then all I ken say is, the enemee treats em better'n
                     we do; for they've hed no checks from us for the last five munths."
                  "Head of the nashin," I anserd, "this is no time for puns. It seems to me that
                     your mayjestick intelleck hes gon a wool-gethering."
                  D. V.," ses he, "I spose you meen that as a reproach; but let me tell you that
                     wool-getherin is wun of the great eends and objecks, of this war. Ax the
                     Constitooshinal Advisers ef it isent."
                  "Yes,"I remarkt, "they've gon in for wool, and cum back shorn."
                  "Not alltogether," ses he ; "ef ennyboddy's ben fleeced, I gess its the
                     publick."
                  "Let us change the subjeck, distingwished rooler," was my reply. "Dont you
                     think you hed better resine, and retire, like anuther Sinsinnatus, to the hog
                     and hominy of privit life?"
                  "The kentry would be wuss off with Hamlin," returnt he.
                  
                  "The ainshent Hannabul warnt more attacht to the intrests of Afriky than he
                     is."
                  "Thats troo, too," I replide; "but mebbe ef the virtoous head of the Guverment
                     was to retire, the Vice would be too moddest to axsept the vakinsy."
                  "Will a duck swim?" he responded, stretchin the fingers of his right hand in a
                     farseeshus and fan-like manner, and restin his thum on the most promenent feter
                     of his pursonal carrickter.
                  I felt I was anserd. Thars no Roman virtoo in the dignitories of the present
                     day. Ketch enny of our Curtisses leapin inter the gulf.
                  Arter sittina few minnits in moody silence, reflectin on modern dejennyracy, I
                     axed him abruply ef he wouldent reconstruck his Cabnet.
                  "Cant do it," ses he.
                  "Wharfore cant you?" I interrogerated.
                  "Bekase," ses he, " amung the uther oaths I tuck on 'Helper's Crysis', I swore
                     to keep em in wun and insuperable as long as my own lease of offis lasted."
                  "Ef that's the case," I replide, bluntly, "its my opinyun your lease of offis
                     will be shorter'n you andizzypate."
                  "Wal," he responded, with a sithe, "it kant be helped. Hevin sworn on the
                     sacrid volum of my church, and bein a member in good standin, I musn't resk my
                     salvashin by backin down."
                  "Think of the salvashin of the Union," ses I.
                  "Evry man for hisself, and the devil take the hindmost," he anserd, castin his
                     eyes uppards.
                  "Yes." ses I, with a groan, "I bleeve that is the creed of the present
                     Administrashin."
                  But mebbe he will relent. Let us hop so.
                  As I was about to leve the presence, he tuck me by the button and axed me ef I
                     knew wot was the diffrence atwixt my frend, Honest Abe, and a Seecesh planter.
                     I rekwested him to spit it out, for I was in a hurry, and hed to attend sum to
                     serus bizness.
                  "Why," ses he, " the difference is that one's the slave of prenceple, and the
                     other's the prencepal of slaves."
                  I whistled ironically.
                  "Stop," he continued, "I've got anuther for you. Why is a splendid milentary
                     banner like a black sojer? You'd never gess it, so I'll tell you. Its bekase
                     its wun of the Pomps of war."
                  I jerked back, indignently, leavin the button in his hand, and hastend to the
                     Nayshinal to rite this letter, and subscribe myself, despairinly,

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, December 24, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Burnside may not be wun of these onrepressabul milentary fenixes as nose no setch
                  ward as fail, but he's a morril hero, and no mistake. Ef he kant take brestwurks
                  like a Wellington, he ken take responsability like a brick. He lifts all the blame
                  of the Fredericksbug affair from the sholders of the Administrashin, and offers
                  hisself a willin sacrifice to save the President from censhur. In this respeck he
                  reminds me of the eggsemplary Isick, of Skripter sellebrity, who was willin to hev
                  his throte cut for the benefit of the Father Abraham of ainshent times. The oney
                  difference atwixt the two magnannymus individyals is, that Isick eskaped with a
                  scare, while thar is no let up wotsumdever for the onfortnit Ambrose.
               It must be a wunderful consolashin to the nayshin to larn from the Commnitty on
                  the Conduck of the War, that evrything was dun for the best. The librality of the
                  War Department in placin onbounded confidence in a ginral who declared he hed no
                  confidence in hisself, must allus stand conspickus in history as a pruff of the
                  perfound nollidge of human natur possest by the dubble team of lawyers at present
                  harnest to the war-chariot of the Union. How plesent it must be to the peeple to
                  know that insted of bein onyoked and turnt out to grass, they air to be continned
                  in the traces, and suffered to flounder along the bluddy track ontil they get
                  fairly stuck among heeps of slorterd heroes and further proggress is
                  onpossabul.
               
               The address of the illustrus Abe to the Army of the Potomac (witch is the
                  offspring of his own raity mind, onaded by any hint from me) butiffilly clars away
                  the smoke from the battelfeeld of the Rapperhammock, and shows that the lite
                  checks we receved in buckrin tagin onsirmountable obstickles was merely the result
                  of wun of those trifflin "axidents" that will happen in the best regilated
                  milentary famalies. Ginral Schunk, if you recolleck, met with a simildar misfortin
                  on a small skale, when he butted six or sevin car-loads of sojers, inter a maskt
                  battery at Vienna, in the beginnin of the war. Strange as it may seem to the pius
                  mind, a blind reliance on soopernatral favor doosent seem to pay. The Providence
                  as shapes our eends oney doos, the pollishin off, and ef the blockin out is dun
                  blindfolded, wot is to be eggspected in consekens but "the leetle eend of nuthin
                  whittled down to a pint". The triumfant manner in witch Burnside recrost the river
                  on the sly, is jestly considered a grate explite by the President. It was
                  sartainly nuther an error nor an "axident", but the brilyant idee of a sooperior,
                  intellect witch hevin but one hole to creep out at, hed the saygasity not to be
                  abuv makin use of it.
               The concludin passidge of my nobul frend's address, whar he simperthises with the
                  "severely wounded" is creditabul to his sensabilities. Also it shows the
                  oridginality of his discriminatin mind. An ornary man, in his sitiwashin, would
                  hev simperthised with the onfortnit cripples without distinkshin of pursons, but
                  he benevlently sellecks the wurst cases for his affeckshinit regards, levin the
                  flesh cuts and mild perferashins resultin from the "axident", to derive cumfurt
                  from the reflexshin that it mought hev ben an all-fired sight wurse.
               It is a luvly trait in the modern Father of his Kentry, that he never blames
                  ennyboddy for doonin ennything witch evrybody sees might hev ben avided; nor for
                     not dooin ennything witch was absolutely necessary to prevent
                  "axidents". What a happy thing it is for this glorius nayshin that our Cheef
                  Madgistrit's hed is not of the same saft materyal as his hart. Ef it was we mought
                  find it a hard matter to "ockapy and possess" the rebellyus South doorin his term
                  of offis.
               I hope the North is satisfied that the delay of the pontoons ontil the faverable
                  moment for leadin the army over em to hullsail slorter, wals wun of those
                  onforseen suckemstances over witch noboddy hes enny control. Hanlleck gin the
                  order to hev em sent on; but in coarse it warnt his bizuness to know whether it
                  was attended to. As Blundersby (I think that's his naane) says in the play of
                  Domboy and Son, "if so be they was sent, so, and ef so be as they warnt sent, why
                  so also." Axidentlally it was "so also". Major Ginral Halleck,, I
                  would hev the public to know, hes his place as distinkly defined as ef he was head
                  butler in a privit famaly. Now a head butler you know mought consistently order
                  the footman to tell the housemaid to leave word with the cook to send the
                  errand-boy to desire the ostler to request the coachman to harness up the losses,
                  drive the kerridge to the doctor's, and bring him forthwith to attend the sick
                  master of the establishment. Blut ef the order warnt eggsecuted and the sick boss
                  died in consekens, the butler wouldent be to blame you know. Bein suckemstanced
                  precisely the same, Ginral Halleck must be simildarly eggscused. Its dredful to
                  think that some people should be so onrighteously ignorant of offishal etiket, as
                  to spose the Ginral orter hev seen as his dereckshins was obeyed. Setch things is
                  never dun. I hope you will make this fact clar to the vox populie;
                  for tho you will hardly bleeve it, sum fokes is inconsiderit enuff to lay, the
                  blud of the brave men wiped out in the battel of Fredericksburg at Ginral
                  Halleck's door. As I wunst remarkt on a prevus ockrashin, "Republicksa
                     is ongrateful".
               The Constitooshinal Advisers, bein of a tenasshus nater, intends to stick to the
                  President and thar places. They rallid around him airly in the week and ashoored
                  that imminent Statesman that they would never desert him. I was not present at the
                  affectin intervew, but was informt, that Stanton's spectikles was dim with tears,
                  and that the baird of Welles kwivered with onrepressabul emoshen. Setch is thar
                  devoshin to my high-minded frend, that ef evry city and town, in the Union was to
                  get up mass meetins and petishin for thar retirement, I skarsly think they would
                  hev the hart to tare tharselves away. I should like to see the eggsperiment tried,
                  ef it was oney to test thar patytryitism.
               Christmas past rayther glumily here; the convalessent sojers, howsever, was treted
                  to a first-rate dinner, thanks to the intrest taken in thar welfare by Mrs. Smith,
                  the genrus helpmeat of the Constitoooshinal Adviser of the Interior
                  Department.
               Hopin that the little "axident" on the Rapperhammock will be lucked upon in its
                  troo light by a confidin peeple, I remain confusedly,

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, January 2, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               All the Constitooshinal Advisers, bein now fixt in thar births faster'n they was
                  afore the Fredericksburg miscarriage, the nayshin may luck forrard with chcrful
                  confidens to a new serious of fienancyal, milentary and navel aborshins. Mr.
                  Chase, the distingwisht manyfactorer of paper mashy playthings for
                  groan childern, is preparin a new Treshury Game for the gay seesin, to be called
                  the "Triumps of Trumpery". It consists of picter keards of varus desines, intended
                  for bilden housen arter the pattern of the Shattoes in Spain. The game is simpel
                  and eesily seen throo; and is kept on a slate to witch a spunge is attacht, for
                  wipin out the figgers at the conclushin. I onderstancl it is intended to lustrate
                  the great moneytary prencepul that the saiftest way to raise the wind is to
                  inflate the currency. The Seckatry, of the Treshury hes peculiar idees on the
                  spondoolick kwestin, witch, in his capassity of Constitooshinal Adviser, he
                  yestday onfolded to my strong-minded frend, the President, as follers:
               "Abe," ses he (for he allus addresses the President as a man and a bruther, and
                  not as a high old public funkshinary)—"Abe, my feller citysin," ses he, "gold is
                  the solid, portabul ritches of a kentry, is it not?"
               "I cornseed the pint," replide the seckind Washington.
               "Wal, then," continued the Seckatry, "the more the nayshin's gold is wuth in the
                  hum market, in coarse the richer the nayshin is; you'll not attemp to contrivert
                  that?"
               "Nary contrivert," anserd the Hed of the Guverment, flippin up a nickel and
                  ketchin it in the pam of his hand.
               "Wal," resoomed the custoadyun of the publick pus, "I hev alreddy raised the
                  valley of gold thirty per sent abuv the ornary level, and I intend to keep it a
                  mountin ontil it reeches ninety or a hunderd per sent abuv par, and evry gold
                  dollar in the kentry, incloodin the ror materyal in Californy, is wuth two
                  dollars. What do you think of that, now, my troo American? and yet the
                  conservatives say Ime impoverishin the kentry."
               "But," ses the Eggseggative, runnin his fingers throo his bar, as if he was makin
                  winrows of it, "gold hesent riz abroad, hes it? and if our merchants purchis thar
                  truck whar a gold dollar's oney wuth its face, and hes to sell whar the same
                  coin's wuth two dollars, it peers to me that the commershil intrest will sun go to
                  the—."
               "Let the commershil intrest keep its munny to hum," he rejincd, sharply. "Tuther
                  side of the Atlantick is agin us. Let us inskribe on our banners," ses he, in a
                  bust of paytryotic devoshin, "Let us prent on our Star-Spangled and glory-striped
                  standard, 'No connexshin with the beggars opposit.'"
               "O! that, indeed," remarkt the President, cherfully eggstendin his hand—witch the
                  Seckatry skweeged with emoshin, in token that they understood wunanuther. So the
                  Seckatry's new game receved the Presidenshil sankshin, and ef Congress is willin,
                  the picters will be reddy for delivery purty recently.
               Perfeck repose prevails in the Navy Department. The respecktabul longshoreman as
                  persides over it feels sorry for the Ariel, and thinks the Californy gold hed
                  better be shipt direct by the way of Cape Horn in futur, or at least ontil setch
                  time as the Pacific Railroad is finisht, or the Alabammer capturd, witchever of
                  those two cummin events may chanst to happen first. He considers it an act of
                  creminel keerlessness in the San Francisky nabobs, knowin wot they know, to have
                  resked ennything in the Gulf onder the American flag. "Stupid Old Tops," ses he, "
                  why diddent they ship in English bottoms." He thinks the best way for the American
                  ship oners and shipping merchants to protect tharselves agin loss, is to keep all
                  thar ships in port and let furrin vessels do the carryin trade, ontil the
                  Alabammer, and the Oreter, and the uther rebel priviteers is captered by the San
                  Jasento or the Tuskyroarer, or sum of Wilkes's flyin Squodrun as annilates time
                  and space at the rate of six nots an hour.
               Thar was a gay time at the White House yestday. Evrybody as is ennybody called to
                  wish the illustrus ockipants a happy new year, and offer thar congratilashins on
                  the state of the kentry. Menny large corntractors was on hand and gin thar vews of
                  pollytickle economy, with witch the President was mutch, delited. All the Constitooshinal Advisers
                  paid thar respecks, and Messrs. Halleck and Stanton presented the plan of a new
                  milentary Annie Condy for 1863; but Mr. Lincoln sed he could nuther make head nor
                  tale of it, and Seward remarkt in his sourcaustic way that it reminded him
                  onrepressably of a Gaudyan Not of red tape, and that the best thing the President
                  could do was to cut it.
               Chase was in high sperrits, and arter the bizness conversashin I hev, elsewhar
                  referd too, him and the President hed sum very plesent joaks together. "Torkrin of
                  bonds, Chase," sez the latter, "wot do you think of the bonds of
                  matteromoney?"
               The Seckatry blusht salmon cullur as he remarkt in reply, that he was negoshiattin
                  for sum skrip of that carricktor with a vew to the consolidashin of the Union.
                  Welles, cuming up at the moment, the Cheef Madgistrit axed him why Chase wos like
                  Neckar, a sellybrated French Seckatry of the Treshury. The Venabul Navel
                  funkshinary didn't take—he never doos—and the President eggsplained that "Salmon
                  P. reminded him of Neckar, bekase he pershood a Neck or nuthin pollysee." Skarsly
                  hed the larf at this killin wittyschism, sobsidled, when Mr. Lincoln, with a
                  glistening eye, perpounded anuther. "Why," ses he, "is our esteemable frend from
                  Ohio like a lottery dealer?" Blair thort it was prehaps on ackount of his bein
                  engaged to be marrid, and marridge bein a lottery. But the President informd us,
                  with a wink, that it was "bekase he was the Chance Seller of the Exchecker." Mr.
                  Chase lucked rayther blank at this definishin, and edgin his way outer the crowd
                  around the Eggseggative, went and sot down in the furthest corner of the rum, whar
                  he tuck the Mansipayshin Proclalmaashin outer his pocket, and began to studdy it.
                  Shortly arter that I made my adoos, as the French say, and as I past out he was
                  still porin over that interestin dockyment, with every aperience of a man in the
                  airly stages of morril insanity.
               I spose the publick will expect my opinyun of the Mancipayshin Proclamashin in
                  this letter. The publich will be disappinted. I hav oney hed it in my hands a few
                  hours—for the President made it entirely outer his own head without consultin
                  me—and Ime not sartain that I onderstand it. I think howsever I shall be abel to
                  git it thro my har by the date of my next epistol, and ontil then I remain

                  sprung up atween us, but on Wensdasy he gin me a speshil awjence and we renewed
                  the intent cordial over a glass of the prime old Hennessee, witch he
                  keeps in a privit cubby hole for the use off his troo frends. Altho a Total
                  Obstinant hisself he sor no resin, he sed, why an old wetterun like D. V.
                  shouldn't wet his whissel, with a thimbulful of O. D. V. now and then ef he felt
                  like it.
               This prelimindary bein disposed of he axed me, as a man sirkelatin freely in
                  sosity, wot the publick at large thort of the Edick of the First of January.
               Ses I, "Sum thinks its a big meashure, and uther sum I that youve put your foot in
                  it."
               "And wot do you think of it," he remarkt rayther narvusly.
               "Wal," ses I, "I considder it a new pruff that the pen is mityer'n the swoord; for
                  it peers to me that wot your pen rit in hafe an hour it will take an alltejus long
                  time for the swoord to redooce to practiss.
               "Then I spose you luck upon it as a bad egg," rejined he, "Your idee is that ontil
                  weve whipt the whites its no use torkin about braking the yoke of the blacks."
               "Not eggsackly that," I replied, "but it doos seem to me that pen and ink
                  manyfesters is ridickalus here, without sum moovement in the army stashinery at
                  Falmouth."
               
               "But," subjested the President, "hars a fine openin for the proclamashin in the
                  Sow West. See how Rosencranch hes druv the rebels outer Murphysburrow."
               "My sangwin frend," ses I, "I hevent made up my mind yet whether Rosencranch has
                  wun a victry or barely eskaped a defeet. And besides," I added smutherin a larf,
                  "youve blocked your own game in that kwarter by speshilly eggseptin the darkeys of
                  Tennessee, Kaintucky, and Missoora, from the blessin of bein 'hensforrard and
                  forever free.' Whar you could hev gin Sambo libty and helped him to maintain it,
                  you hev left him in slavery, and whar you hevent a man or a gun to back him, you
                  hev invited him to rise with the sartainty of gettin his throat cut."
               "D. V., I'm afeard you put the case too trooly," he responded, "but it never
                  struck me in that light afore."
               "That's bekase you lent your ear to a passel of asses," ses I "insted of trustin
                  to a faithful old hoss, like me, as never bolts the strait track of common sense
                  and common jestice. You foller the lead of them Constitooshinal Advisers of yourn,
                  and see ef they don't land you on your head in the bottomless pit of pollytickle
                  perdishin," ses I.
               "Wot ken I doo?" he eggsclamed implorinaly. "I'm like Isacur atwixt two
                  burdens—wot ken I do?"
               "Kick," ses I, "send em flyin. Rare up in madjesty of your manhood, and giv em
                  goss. Moove the Army of the Potomac from the banks of the Rapperhammock whar's its
                  no more use than Faro's host at the bottom of the Red Sea. Thar's more roads to
                  Richmound than wun, isent thar?" ses I.
               "But Stanton and Halleck both say—"
               "In coarse they both say," I shouted skornfully, "theyre the greatest sayers out.
                  Wot the Kentry wants is sumboddy that will do."
               "I know it, I feel it," ses he, "but wots to be dun?"
               "Ship em," I replide. "Give em thar walkin papers and try Holt and Butler, or
                  Butler and Maclellin in thar places. I used to think Maclellin was rayther slow,
                  but I don't bleve it would ever take him a fortnit to send a lot of pontoons a
                  hunderd milds."
               "It sartainly wouldn't pay," ses the President musingly, "for that army to remain
                  moshinless in Statue Co all winter. The nayshinal
                  eggspenditoors is uppard of two millyuns a day and not four hunderd thousand
                  cummin in, and the incum tax not due for four munts yet."
               "Payl!" I cried, jumpin onto a cheer in a aggerny of irritashin. "Pay! I tell you
                  it; would break the Nayshin's hart."
               "Wall," ses he, in a husky vice, "wot route do you think Durnside oughter
                  take."
               I sot down, and dippin my finger in the water pitcher, drord a cumpleat map of the
                  seat of war in Virginny on the rosewood table, includin the Rapperhammock, the
                  Rapid Ann, the James, the York, the Chickenhominy, the Pawmonkey, Shocko Crick,
                  Hamton Rodes, Fort Monro and the Rip Raps. That dun I laid down a line of march,
                  witch if follerd up, would land us in Richmound by the middle of February. The
                  President approoved the plan, and ef he hes the firmness to stick to it and ken
                  find ennybody as is competent to carry it out, we may yet dictate turms of peace
                  from the rebel capital, afore our own capital is all eggspended. I am not aloud
                  even to wisper the particklers in confidens; but I rally think that ef the
                  President's vertebray doosent give out, the back bone of the rebellyun will hev to
                  give in. Wishin speedy destruckshin to the latter spinal collume andl more vim and
                  viggor to the former I remain, the President's Right Hand Man and

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, January 23, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               It takes considabul to ruin a great krentry; but the thing ken be dun, ef a jint
                  stock cumpany of loonatisks, and fools, and swindlers, and theves is entrusted
                  with the job, and sleeps at it long enuff. This gloryus republick, Messrs. E
                  dyturs, is now at the marcy of a seleck few from the two first classes, and a
                  multitood as no man ken numuber from the two last; and things looks as favorabul for its goin to everlastin smash
                  as enny enemee of free institooshuns and frend of the devil ken passably desire.
                  Thars obstickles in the way, I admit. We hev a furrin trade as carries our, sales
                  and paddles into evry sea. We hev eenamost onlimited internal resorses. We hev an
                  army of a millyun of the bravest men as ever smoldered ai shootin-iron, in the
                  feeld and a navy of three hundred and fifty ships and thirty-five thousand sailors
                  on the oshin and in harbor. But notwithstandin all this, our merchant vessels is
                  burned by pirits so near our shores that we ken purty nigh smell the smoke; furrin
                  craft runs throo our blockadin skwadrons as easy as fallin off a log; our credit
                  and carrickter amung the nashins of the airth is nix; aud our armies is led into
                  the most convenient places that is to be found on the map for bein slortered
                  without the slightest chanst for victry. It may take some years to rooin the
                  Nayshin, even by this paytent prosess, for it is tuffer'n indy rubber, and twiste
                  as sprinlgy; but with perseverance and the assistance of idyotic currency, tinkers
                  and smart Guverment corntractors, the eend may be ackomplisht, ef our eggsellent
                  President, the seckind edishin of the Father of his Kientry, with all the modern
                  improovements, preserves his Roman firmness, and keeps his foot set down agen all
                  changes in his Cabnet.
               You mustn't spose, Messrs. Eddyturs, that I mean enny disrespeck to that
                  extrornary man. His buzzum is full of paytryotic seniments jest about as good as
                  they make em. Even wen his head misleeds him, he is allus, to use an eggspreshin
                  of his own, "sound on the goose". The diffikulty is this. Sartain members of the
                  Cabnet hev perswarded him that with thar assistance he ken restore the Union, and
                  not otherways. Ef they hed told him that they tharselves, by thar own onassisted
                  talent and genus, could put things strait, his nateral penetrashin would hev seen
                  throo em, and overboard theyd hev went. But by makin hin the hero of the drayma
                  and pretendin to be soopernoomerees, they hev contrived to identify tharselves
                  with hisself on the united-we-stand-divided-we-fall prenceple, and he acktilly
                  thinks that ef he was to dismiss em, the kentry would cullaps and the Guvernment
                  be a goner.
               In coarse I hev labored faithfully to cure him of this onhappy noshin, but I find
                  it onpossabul to make the desired impresshin. He perfesses the same frenship for
                  me as ever. He brings out the Coneyac and Mungoheeler as ushil, and lissens to my
                  eggsposishins with the solemnity of a nainshent Nester, but when I hev sed my say,
                  insted of givin me an approovin nod, as he used to do formally, he signifies his
                  dissent in a brace of shakes. Ime sumtimes inklined to think his head is going.
                  Ken it be that a black cloud is getherin over that wunst fair intelleck? Is it
                  declinin from fair to middlin, and will it finally run emptyins? I say to myself,
                  sumtimes, is this man, wunst considerd so clarsighted, destined to becum a Leer.
                  Will a time cum when like that onfornit monnick he will not know enuff to go in
                  when it rains? It may be so. We know what we air, but we know not wot we shall be.
                  We know wot he is, but the Lord oney knows wot he will
                  be.
               In the meantime—and a very mean time it is—the Constitooshinal Advisers persoos
                  thar ornary line of pollysee. The Seekatry of War and his milentary twin the
                  General in Cheef cotinnes cam and cumpleasant. The dead of Fredericksburg and
                  Vicksbug peers to sit eesy on thar souls. Wot thar futur plans is I dont know.
                  Praps they place thar trust in Providence, praps in the chapter of axedents; a
                  chapter to which thar perceedins hes made so menny horribul addishins. Sartainly
                  thev dont relie on the Arimy of the Potomac, witch, according to the hyferlutin of
                  wun of em, hes "ceast to eggsist". Sum thousands of its oridginal members hes
                  ondoubtedly "ceast to eggsist", thanks to the negleck of the Warr Department, in
                  failin to see to the fulfillment of its own orders, and in buckin brestbones agren
                  brestwurks at Fredericksburg. Ef the epaletted funkshinary as made the remark, and
                  who never was onder fire senst the Lord made him, hed "ceast to eggsist", hafe an
                  hour arter he becum a ginrallssimo at Washinton, it wouldd hev ben a blessed
                  suckemstance. But of individuals of his kidney, "few dies and nun resigns."
               Wal, this army, dead or alive, is now across the Rapperhammock, and between this
                  and Sunday you and me and the public, may hev an opportoonity to know wether
                  Major-ginral Halleck's intimashin that it is a disorganized mob is troo or false.
                  If it onfortnitly proove troo let the blame rest upon him and Stanton, who placed
                  at the head of the flour of the American Army a leder as declared hisself
                  incompetent to command it, and who failed to supply him with the means of crossin
                  the Rapperhammock when he could hev obtaned an eesy victry. Skirmishin, ef not a
                  ginral engagement, is now goin on atwixt a porshin of Burnside's troops and Ginral
                  Lee's rare, and the bleef in Washington is that we hev hed the wurst of it.
               But Ime forgettin that afore this epistol cums to hand youll know the trooth—or at
                  leest as much of it as the milentary
                  blatherskites as rools the roast here, thinks the suverin peeple oughter know.
               Hopin for the best, and trustin that the God of Armies will nooteralize the
                  assanine counsels and projecks of the idyots who hev wasted so much preshus blood,
                  and giv us success in spite of em, I remain, prayin for the Union,
               
                  Yours allus,

                     charges of imbecility made against our excellent Chief Magistrate are in the
                     highest degree indecorous and improper. He scarifies Senator Saulsbury, of
                     Delaware, for denouncing him as incompetent, and manifests the warmest sympathy
                     for him as a ruler, a man, and a brother.—EDS.]
               
               
                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, January 30, 1862.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               A purty state of things we're cummin to, when a Sennitor gits up in his place and
                  charges the Head of the Nashin with imbesillyty. Saulsberry, a copperhead from the
                  humapathic State of Delawar, as you air well awar, a tacted the highest publick
                  funkshinnary in the most vipertuperative langwidge on Tuesday last. He sed, in
                  effeck, that the modern Father of his Kentry was a missabul spoon, for witch he
                  was very properly taken inter custardy, notwithstandin his attemp to inaugerate a
                  revolushin with his revolver. I rite warmly on the subjeck, for I feel riled and
                  put by to think that my illustrus frend should be held up to public contemp as a
                  foo-foo. Ef it hed a ben a Constitooshinal Adviser now, I wouldent hev keered a
                  mite; but to call honest Old Abe a ninnycumpoop right out in meetin, thus givin
                  countenance to the skandalus reports of that nater sirkilatin all over the kentry,
                  peers to me to be sackreligus and onchristrian. Even ef our paytryotic Cheef
                  Madgistrit, insted of bein, as he is, the Solomon of the Western Henaspear,
                     warn't more'n half rocked, would it be right for wun of his own
                  kentrymen, nussed in the same cradle of Libty as hisself, and ockapyin a seat in
                  the Upper House, to call him a nidiot? George the Third acktilly was
                  a nidiot, and yet I never heerd of a member of the Brittish Parleyment throwin
                  it'up to him in a speetch.
               I was on the flore of the Sennit when the Delawar chap pitcht inter the President,
                  and am bound to say that his remarks was extree-venamus; so much so that I felt it
                  to be my dooty to call at the White House and simperthise with its ockypant as I
                  would with a bruther. Ses I to him: "Wot ef you did hold palavers with Burnside's
                  offsirs, onbeknown to him; and wot ef you did encurridge em to pore thar
                  greevances inter your privit ear; and wot ef you did dekline to remoov em when the
                  Ginral ackused em of undermindin, and baring false witness and leaguin together to
                  set the army agin him, hedent you a right to do it? Air you not," ses I, "the
                  Cummander-in-Cheef; and ef you chuse to be gided by back-stair reports in your
                  milentary pollysee, is that enny pruff," ses I, "that your brain's addled? Spose
                  you did pervent Macdoil from jinin Maclellin at the critickle moment, and
                  interfear with Burnside when he thort he hed a shoor thing, thats not to say
                  you're an ignoramus."
               Horris Greely's idees about stoppin the war in May or June, ef we dont lick the
                  rebels and make em sue for a piece by that time, is creatin considabul of a
                  sensashin here, and it is torked around in pollytickle sirkils that him and the
                  French Plenipenitentiary and the French Empror is skeemin to hev France offer
                  mediashin immediently. I gess Nap the III wont ketch us nappin, ef he tries it on.
                  Ef he wants to wake up a hornet's nest and git his comb cut, jest let him thrust
                  his nose inter the Union hive, thats all. Ime sprised that Horris, who hes
                  hertofore starnly refused to countenance ennything in the shape of a divishin of
                  the Union, should kinder turn doe-face now. His vews is gall and wurmwood to the
                  corntracktors here, who are all in faver of carryin on the war to the bitter eend.
                  They think he oughter be rested at wunst for high treason, and brort on here onder
                  a warrant from the Seckatry of State. Sartainly, Boilo, of the Philadelphy
                     Evening Jernil, got inter hot water for a much less matter. But,
                  as the sayin is, sum men ken steel bosses without bein hawld up for it, while
                  uther sum is liable to be hung for hevin a halter about em, In the Supreme Court
                  abuv thars no distinkshin of pursons; but our supreme orthorities not onfrekwently
                  shets thar eyes to the pickadillies of pursons of destinkshin, and takes it out in
                  flaxin out the noboddies. It seems
                  strange to menny that the eddytur of the Triboon, arter promisin
                  nigh onto a millyun of men to the Guverment as sun as the mansipayshin of the
                  blacks and the confisticashin of the property of the rebel whites was proclamed,
                  should be the first to cum forrard in faver of backin out. But pollytickle
                  eddyturs is not like uther men; they air fearfully and wunderfully made, and
                  partake considabul of the nater of that singlar fowl called the wethercock, which
                  allus changes frunt in a storm. I may menshin as a case in pint, that it is
                  whisperd around here amung New Yorkers that Thurlo Weed is goin to form a
                  coalishin with Wood for the porpus of gettin up a great controllin party in your
                  State. It may not be alltogether troo, prehaps, but whar thars so mutch smoke
                  thars shoor to be sum fire, and when setch eggstreams meets, it shows the
                  rottenness of party pollyticks.
               Thars also a rummer here that my destingwished bruther Unionist, the President, is
                  in faver of closin up the war wun way or tuther in ninety days, but I feel
                  satisfied the story is a cunard set aflote by agents of the Brittish Guverment,
                  and Ime inklined to think that the curryspondent of the London Times in your city
                  is at the bottom of it. I onderstand Seckatry Seward hes his eye on the swell, and
                  ef he doosent look out, its not onlikely that he'll git hisself in a tight place
                  sunner'n he andizzypates.
               The trooth is that the issoo of the war is nuther more nor less than a kwestin of
                  endoorance. Ef we dont cave in, the rebels must; and its my bleef that ef they
                  warnt encurridged by a passel of white-liverd Nuthern eddyturs and speetchmakers,
                  they'd cry pigcavi right away.
               With sentiments of perfound contemp for setch reptyles, I remane, with a cuss on
                  all cowards,

                  NASHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, February 5, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Curus, isent it, that jest as we was on the pint of razing Charlestun to the
                  ground, thar should be strong ground for sposin that Charlestun hes razed the
                  blockaid. Making all doo deduckshins for Bowerygard's eggsagerashins and
                  Ingarhum's bolderdash, the tail cummin as it doos ofishally from head kwarters
                  kennot be sot down as altogether a fish story. Grandfather Whitehead, the venabul
                  sumnambulist as holds the portfoolyou of the Navy Department, bleves it I
                  understand. As he was awar that the rebels was gettin reddy two powerful iron rams
                  at Charlestun, and that we hed nuthin fit to tackel em in the harbor, he naterally
                  concloods that they may have bucked inter the squodrun and given us considabul of
                  a muttoning. With his ushil prompness, howsever, he no sunner heerd of the
                  owdashus attact, than he ordered four more gunboats to be sent South from the New
                  York Navy Yard, with immedient dispatch, and I larn on good orthority that ef
                  nuthin onforseen happens, the Nantuckit, the Samgammon, and two uther iron clads
                  may be lucked for on the seen of the late outrage in about two weeks. The
                  Department is beseeched by scores of ankshus inkwirers, and the eggsightment is
                  intens. But the Seckatry is ekwil to the immnerginsea. He strokes his baird
                  self-cumpleasantly, and ses we must be prepard for ockashinal discomforters. Upon
                  the hull, he thinks the Charlestun affair won't turn out to be mutch wurse'n than
                  the Merrimack's flare up in Hamton Roads, or the Galvestun
                     fieasko. It hes ben subjected to him in a mild and frendly
                  wisper, that as luck appeers to be agin him, it wouldent be a bad idee for him to
                  resign; but he intermates that he will sheer the forten of the nayshin as long as
                  Uncle Sam hes a shot in the locker. The slytest hint at desartin the President at
                  the present junkter mooves him to tears. Borroring a metafore from his former line
                  of life he swars he will never give up his post ontil the King of Terrors consines
                  him to the ded letter office. The tenassity of Constitooshinal Advisers is amazin.
                  Ticks clings doggedly to the cuetickle of a tarrier, mussels holds on like grim
                  death to the rocks, and barnickles on ships bottoms sticks closter'n a bruther,
                  but the way a Constitooshinal Adviser adhears to his "coin of vantage", as the
                  poick ses, is a oawshin to Cabnet curosities. You will recolleck that when it was
                  hinted around that the diffydent Stanton and the vidgelant and thortful Halleck
                  was about to retire, I dident goinside with the ginral opinyun eggsprest by
                  outsiders on that subjeck. I new those
                  great men of old. I was awar of thar devoshin to prenceple and that intrest was a
                  seckendary considerashin with em. I was satisfied that there was no sackrifiz they
                  warn't prepard to make, sunner'n shift the responsability to uther sholders. And
                  Ime proud to say I didn't put too low an estimit on thar paytryitism. Look at em.
                  Thar they stand, firm and self-possest, like two Payshenses on a Moneyment smildin
                  at Grief. As for Seckatry Welles I consider him anuther Markus Curtis reddy for a
                  rush inter the Gulf whenever his kentry demands the fatal splurge.
               The Triboon's last propersishin, to eend the war with the present
                  camppain, no matter witch whips, is perdoocin the liveliest emoshins of hope, and
                  gratitood in the buzzums of the seecesh simperthisers here. His bold novel and
                  strikin assershin that "ef our armies do not whip theirn, theirn 'll whip ourn" is
                  univarsally konsiderd a masterpeace of lodgic. Seward allows it is a perfound
                  syllygism, redooced to its simplest form.
               My holesold feller paytryit, the Honabul Abe, is in a perplexin perdickyment. For
                  a long time, as the kentry is awar, he was a kinder shuttlecock atwixt the
                  Democratick and the Radical battle doors, but findin it was onpossabul to carry on
                  the war that way, he finaly sobsided inter the hands of the Radicals, eggspectin
                  in coarse that they would keep him up. And now what doos the file leader of the
                  Radical press doo but fly off the handel, and in effeck advise him to sho the
                  white father and giv up the game. But Ile say this for Abraham Lincoln; he hesn't
                  the most distant noshin of givin up onder enny suckcmstances wotsumdever. On menny
                  subjecks he hes diffrent noshins at diffrent times, but on the kwestin of tighten
                  Rebellyun to the last dollar, the last man, the last ditch, and the last day, ef
                  in the coarse of human events it should becum nessary, he is perfeckly unannymus.
                  Depend upon it A. Lincoln will never desart E P Unum.
               We are lookin for noose from Vicksburg and from Foster's eggspedishin evry hour,
                  and tho hopin for the best air prepard for the wurst. Arter the Charlestun
                  calamity, nuthin ken take us by supprise.
               Washington has ben blue with uniforms senst the cold snap sot in. Heroes with bad
                  colds curms in on furlows evry day kivered with goose pimples, and ankshus for hot
                  whisky-skins. Willard's hed nine hunderd gests the uther day, and the Nayshinal is
                  jest as full as it can cram. Our confirmed bragadear-ginrals is lyin loose around
                  evrywhars in a busted up condishin; and feeld and line ofsifrs that oney want

                  is as thick as sample vials in a liker marchent's rack.
               Trusten that afore this letter gets inter prent, we shall hey sum good tidins to

                  [A queer communication from our cranky correspondent. Verily, he is no
                     respecter of persons or personages. In fact, he has a particular predilection
                     for "shining marks", and nothing suits him better than to take the shine out of
                     them, when it happens to be mere varnish. He cares no more for high
                     functionaries than he does for a frame of ten-pins, and would just a lief bowl
                     them down. In the following letter he makes a ten-strike. Some may think,
                     however, that he rolls his ball with a little too much

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, February 13, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The sore feelin pervalin at the Seat of Guvermnent hes ben considabully aggervated
                  by the owdayshus kicks resently reseved from the rebels at Galvustun Bay and the
                  Sublime Pass-Rare Admiral Ferrygut reports that the "Harriet Lane " surrenderd to
                  the enemee's catamarans in a most pussylanimuss manner. Its troo the wind oney
                  came in cat'spaws, and tharfore she couldent hev clawed off; but ef she'd ben
                  properly handeld, and hed pitched inter the cotton skows tooth and toe-nail, thars
                  no dout she mout hev made thar fur fly. Then thars the "Mornin Light," anuther
                  dark bizness. Her cummander, it seems, gin up the ship without firin the first
                  gun. The Admaril ses he never seen the match of it. Setch conduck is enuff to make
                  the molderin forms of Decaytur and Lorrence start from the supplecur, and to dror
                  tears from the eyes of Cummodore Bainbridge's nevvy, ef that offshoot of a nobul
                  stock still sirvives. The Seckatry of the Navy, howsever, is noways decomposed. He
                  wares his ushil cam and plassid aspeckt, doos Giddy Welles. I persoom soom you will be happy to larn that
                  altho enlistin hes stopt, and desarshins, from the ranks is large and frekwent,
                  the number of paytryits willin to serve thar kentry in the capassity of feeld
                  offsirs increses evry day. My illustrus feller citysin, the acesessible Abe, hes
                  sent fifteen hunderd milentary nominashins, inter the Sennit, and a new swarm of
                  epaletted lowcussess, ankshus for a chanst at the greenbascks, will, no dout,
                  shortly make thar apperience on Pennsylvany avenoo. Whar they air to find room to
                  spred tharselves is more'n I no, onless the perlecce drives the civillians, inter
                  the side streets, in order to give the newly-manyfactered fire-eaters thar full
                  swing. As it is, bragadears, and kwartermasters, and kernalls, and adjetants, and
                  celery, is thicker'n monkeys in the Straits of Baffleman, whar they kant squar the
                  yards without brushin of em off the rocks. And as sun as the hard figtin begins, I
                  dessay it will be an all-scared sight wurse. Its butifuil to see how ankshus sum
                  milentary men air to rally around the President when thars danger abroad. Setch
                  pruffs off devoshin must tutch his hart, onless he is made of stun; witch he
                  isent—but, on the contrary, all softness.
               Congress is as bizzy as the devil in a hurrycain. Senniter Wilson's bill for
                  margin evry mail citysin abel to bare arms for his kentry a sojer, is likely to
                  pass and to be carrid out to the letter. It applies to purty mutch the hull
                  abel-boddied maskaline poppylashin, and gives the President the power to use em by
                  the kwantity as ockashin rekwires. The bill's eenamost sartain to be a lor, and
                  thar'll be a lively time ginrally when it cums to be enforst. Menny thinks it will
                  promote emmigrashin.
               Then thars Senniter Sumner's cullerd ridgement skeem, pervidin for the enrollment
                  of three hunderd thousand darkeys, to be paid sevin dollars a munth. As Mr. Sumner
                  purfesses to considder a nigger a good as a white man, if not more so, I wish to
                  ax him throo the columes of the SUNDAY MERKARY why he wants to hire
                  him at hafe price. Ef white bone and shinner is wurth thirteen dollars a munth to
                  shoot and be shot, at why shouldent a wool-and-ebony-man-and-bruther—ef he is
                  raaly a man and a brother, as the Senniter ses he is—be paid at the same ratte?
                  Why this invidyus pqniary destinkshin atwixt wool a har? Wavin this pint, I would
                  respeckfully ask whar this black force of three hunderd thousand is to be drummed
                  up. In order to carry the war inter Afriky, you must fast ketch your Afrikinus.
                  How air they to be roped in? It seems to nile that this is an important prevus
                  kwestin witch oughter be put afore the bill is past. It onfortnitly happens that
                  my nobul frend Abraham's ham's proclamashin, givin libty to the captive, is a dead
                  letter whar the black race prencepally pervails. In coarse we kant make our
                  cullerd kindred Union sojers in the rejins of the South we dont "ockapy and
                  possess", and in the other rejins—accordin to the proclamashin—the slaves continny
                  to be slaves, and we hev no right to take em from thar masters. The Mancipayshin
                  Edick is an ingeniuS dockyment; it cuts two ways, and both was is ekwilly
                  redickalus. Eggseggative wisdom is sum if not Sumner.
               As this Congress preposes to skwander no eend of munny (in the form of
                  sirkilatin-picters) afore it; dissolves, and as March forth is closte at hand,
                  things will be put throo amazin kwick for the nex two weeks. The nine hunderd
                  millyunn bill will mebbe hev becum a law by the time this reaches yoon, and mebbe
                  not. It is nip and tuck atwixt the Seckatry of the Treshery and the banks, but I
                  think the Seckatry will run em down and the spiles of the Chase be skewerd to the
                  Guverment.
               I begin to be orfully tired of Washington, and long to be wunst more in my old
                  kwarters at file Sanit Nickalas. But it shell never be sed that I turnt my back on
                  Abraham Lincoln at a time when he skailsly knew witch eend of him was uppermost.
                  Diddent I ackumpany him from Illannoy? Diddent I revise his inaugerole? Dident I
                  subjest his—no, I did not subjest his messidge! Hevent I ben his Rock of Refudge?
                  Hevent I stud atwixt him and his Constitooshinal advisers when they were
                  bullyraggin him eenamost to deth? And shell I forsake him now when he stands on
                  the edge of a pressapeace, with wun leg over, and onabul to keep his center of
                  gravity without my help? Never! Perish the idee!

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, February 19,1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               I congratilate the young men of the krentry on the new claws interdooced inter the
                  cornskripshin, by the Conscript Fathers of the Sennit. Accordin to the Sennit's
                  mendment Young America is not liabul to hev his idees taught how to shoot until he
                  reeches the age of twenty years—in uther-wurds, he hennot be took for a privit,
                  ontil jest twelve munths afore he attains his mayjority. The probility is that
                  this benevolent let up for hobbletehoys, as hev not seen twenty summers, will be
                  sankshind by the poplar branch of the nayshinal legislatoor, and the eggsempshin,
                  like Mrs. Winslow's Soothin Serrup, will proove a great blessin to mothers.
                  Eighteen is too jewvenile. The sperrits is boyant at that age, to be shoor, but
                  the bone is not sot, and that self-respeck and manly dignity witch grows outer
                  familyarity with the lather brush and the razor is oney parshilly developt. Ef our
                  youth kennot be aloud to tarry in Jerryco tell thar bairds is grown, let em stay,
                  at least, ontil the fibers sprout and they begin to sho sum sines of a stiff upper
                  lip.
               It kant be denied, I spose, that this new lor will nock the milentary attryboots
                  of the State Guvners inter a cockt hat. Thars nuthin mealy-mouthed in its
                  provishins. It goes, to the root of the matter and makes my heroic frend, the
                  President, an abesalute Dick Tater. Ef carrid out it will enabul him to run the
                  biggest milentary masheen in the hull wurld, with millyuns of men hitched to the
                  ropes all bound to obey wotever orders he chewses to shout throo the fedral
                  trumpet. But Mr. Lincoln is not of a tyrannical dispersishin—on the contrary, mild
                  and gentle and as easily led as a lam, or a kid, or a tame gaysell.
               On this pint I ken speak with confidens, for I was with him when he submitted
                  without a murmumr to put on a disgise and conseal his majestic form in a cloke and
                  cap, in order to presarve his preshus life for the greatest good of the greatest
                  number. The copperhed noosepapers as pretends to think he will take advantidge of
                  the Cornskripshin Act to becum a formidabul despot, nose better. His natur is not
                  that of a Naughtycrat or a Useupper. And besides thars no possibility of
                  prosecuting the war, it seems, without setch a meshur as Sennytur Wilson's. Sum
                  sos its mainly own to the Sennytur's infarnal stewpidity, in stoppin volunteerin
                  when the hull nashin was bilin over with millentry ambishin, that cornskripshin
                  hes to be resarted too; and these misabul grumblers allow that it would be a good
                  idee for the President to put him whar David put the sellybrated Hittite, namely,
                  in the fore frunt of the fust big shindy.
               I am awar setch remarks is oney intended as coarse joaks at the Massachoosetts
                  man's eggspens, but as I sed to the Nayshins Hope the uther day, when he axed
                  little Tom Thumb wot he thort of Hymen, it is no time for waggery when the dogs of
                  war air at our gates.
               The intelligens, from the Army of the Potomac relates eenamost entirely to wun
                     subject—mud. The main boddy on the Rapperhammock is as helpless as
                  a crowd of flies in a lasses cask, and all the Union troops in Virginny and
                  Merryland is in the same waxy predlickyment. A frend of mine who was present at a
                  dress parade at Fallmouth tuther day, informt me that the divishins as they stud
                  in the ranks hed evry appearance of heving ben cut off at the knees, all below
                  that jint bein wonder the serfiz. Menny of the hevvy infantry hed to be
                  eggstricated with ropes arter the drill was over. Obsarvin number of long sticks
                  resemblin shad-poles protroodin throo the slush in varus places, my frend inkwired
                  thar porpus and was informt that they were put, thar to mark the places whar the
                  sege guns hed gon down. They will be dug up as sun as the sakrid sile is hard
                  enuff to be spaded—mebbe about May or airly in June.
               Ime sorry to say that the troops in Virginny is getting clamrus for thar pay. I
                  hed a letter yestday from a member of the Sixt Artillery cumplainin that his
                  corpse, which was organized last August, hedn't yet reseved the first greenbacks.
                  His remarks about the condishin of his wife and fammaly, who it seems is starvin
                  for thar entry while he is fightin for it, mought hev drord tears from the eyes of
                  a sutler. Slim porshins of his epistol is of a carrickter that would make the
                  portly and passhinit Constitooshinzal Adviser at the head of the War Department
                  dance a bolero and tar his har. Its very rong for a privit to blastfeem his
                  superiors, and I shell rite the mutinus feller to that effect; but when a poor
                  sojer is without a dime in his pocket, and his wife and little wuns wants bred, he
                  hes to swar at sumzthin, you know, and ef he is onreasonabul enuff to cuss a high
                  funkshinary or two, we must try as Christians to luck over it.
               It is not so much on ackount of the men, howsever, as for the sake of the
                  goverment that I would urge the administrashin to do the right thing by the armny
                  for Ime afeard ef it doosent pay the
                  old sojers afore it begins cornskriptin the new wuns, the provost marshils will
                  hev an ungodly hard row to hoe in thar milentary deestricks. Heddent the
                  administrashin better square off with the troops now in the feeld, afore it
                  commences a hullsale draft upon thar fellow citysins to hum, who know how they
                  have been humbugged, and air jest that contrary that they would as livs be shot as
                  sarved with the same sarse?
               The bleef prevales to sum eggstent here, that we air goin to hev a muss with Loose
                  Napoleon. He hes made up his mind to hev cotton ef possable, at all hazards. I
                  seen sumthin of the darned old possum when I was in France, doorin the
                     Coo de tar, and I know when he torks the smoothest and the
                  oilyest, that's the very time he's preparin to pitch in. Ime glad, tharfore, as
                  the harbor of New York is to be better fortyfied right away; for its noways
                  onlikely that we'll be inter a furrin war atwixt this and the next presidenshil
                  eleckshin. Seward is of the same opinyun, and so would the amabul Abe be too, if
                  he hed an opinyun of his own.
               In view of the desalooshin of Congress the desaloot carrickters, from a distans,
                  as was attracted to Washington by the prospeck of publick and privit plunder is
                  packin up, ready for a start. Gamblers, free-luv-ladies, pollytickle theeves,
                  pimps, parrysites, and other individyals of eesy virtoo, is preparin for an
                  immedient stampede, and I dessay that by the day arter March forth the fedral
                  Capital won't be mutch wus'n Sodom, arter the Lot fammaly hed left for anuther
                  Latitood.
               With kind regairds to all the destitoot wives, children, mothers, sisters, and
                  cetery of the onpaid sojers of the Union—in which the War Department and the
                  Paymaster—Ginral, kindly jines—I remain as ushil,
               
                  Yours allus,

                  [Our correspondent is hereby notified that the hint of his intention to leave
                     Washington, with which the following letter concludes, has caused us the most
                     profound concern. We trust he will reconsider the matter, and consent to
                     remain. The people cannot conveniently spare from the Federal Capital so
                     vigilant a sentinel over their rights and interests. The President, it seems
                     also, is desirous of retaining him within consulting-distance. Under such
                     circumstances, it seems to us that it is his duty—and we know he regards duty
                     as paramount to all other considerations—to continue at his post. The moral
                     atmosphere of Washington is not, as he truly observes, conducive to the soul's
                     health; but he, like Brutus, is "armed so strong in honesty", that there can be
                     no danger of his being atacked with the prevailing "moral insanity". Besides,
                     after Congress breaks up, the air will be purer.—EDS.]
               
               
                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. 26, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Afore the date of my next epistol the Resembled Wisdum will hev hed its last
                  settin and made itself non nest. The two houses is dooin up thar
                  little chores with neatness and despatch, and as Wensday, the forth prox,
                  aproximates, bills is husseld to thar final reedins with a perfeck rush. The
                  Cornskripshin Bill is a lor, the Bank Bill is a lor, and I predicate as the Lone
                  Bill will hev jined cumpany with the uther past meshurs by the time this appears
                  in prent. Thars a hitch atwixt Chase and the Conference Committee about tacksin
                  Bank sirkilashin, but I gess the Banks will be nailed in the eend, and hev to
                  plank down. When Congress rises, the firm of HONEST ABE & Co. will be wun of
                  the strongest guverments that has blest the airth senst the days of Alegsander,
                  and the Head of the Nashin will predominate to an onlimited eggstent over the
                  middle and the tail. But as I obsarved in a prevus letter, the kentry needent git
                  itself inter a cast iron swet on ackount of its rites and libties bein
                  consolidated in a single pare of hands. My frend, the Illustrus Rooler of the
                  Republick, is a man of eggsqueezit morril senseabilities and the tenderest of
                  harts—in fack fuller of nateral sweetness than a shugger Cain. The swoord and the
                  pus will be as harmless in his keepin as ef the Angel Gaybril hed the latter in
                  his breeches pocket and the former tuckt onder his wing. I meen harmless to troo
                  paytriots like you and me and Horris Greeley and cetery; but a swoord of rath and
                  a root of all evil, prehaps, to the cussed Confedrits. When Charlestun, Savannah,
                  and Mobile is sacked, and Lee's army bagged, and Vicksburg hammered down, and
                  Richmound in a bad box, we shell all feel the properiety of heving made Abe an
                  abesalute monnick tor the time bein. These great events is all on the keards, and
                     when they air wot the French calls
                     fates accomplice the Rebellyun will be played out. Sum
                  thinks as it will rekwire long 'eatrs for the Government to get the assendancy;
                  while uther sum allows that the rebels will be summerilly nocked cold doorin the
                  spring. Ennyhow I think that when all the abel-bodied men in the North hes ben
                  drafted wonder the Cornskripshin Act, and thrurrowly drilled and dizzyplind, and
                  divided up into corpses and put in the feeld, that the eend will not be far
                  distant.
               Thars a loud wisper runnin round Washington to the effeck that sun artery the
                  breaking up of Congress, a spoke will be put in the wheels of sartain
                  Constitooshinal Advisers. I axed Seward thhe other day ef it was so; and he got
                  kwite adjitated on the subjeck. He sed he heerd thar was a conspurracy agin
                     him, and he knew who was at the bottom of it. Let em cum on," ses
                  he, "Ime reddy for em, and they'll find I don't fear the face of Clay." He was
                  evidently riled, and put me in mind of a play I wunst seen, whar an ambishus chap
                  as wanted evrything his own way denounced a sassy revolushinary feller of the name
                  of Cashus as extree dangerus.
               This mornin I called on the President, and put the inderogatory to him plump and
                  square wether he was goin to giv enny of the Constitooshinals thar walkin tickets.
                  His ansern was rayther non-commital, arisin, I reckin, from the ambiggerus state
                  of his own felines. Ses he:
               "It's eesier to dismiss wun or two or three, Constooshinal Advisers, than it is to
                  seleck that number from fifty candydates without all the rest getin up a tree; and
                  its eesier to let bad enuff alone than it is to enjoy cumfort arter runnin yer hed
                  inter a hornet's nest."
               I ackwiest.
               "You remember," he continned, "the fate of the onfortnit man in the skripters, as
                  no sunner got rid of wun devil than he was besot by seven more of the hardest
                  kind."
               "Yaaas," I ses, "the last state of that individual was wuss'n the first. But,"
                  ses, I, "he was a misabul retch as hed no mind of his own and jest gin up to the
                  fust blamed cusses as cum along. Noboddy will ketch the Seckind Washington doin
                  that I persoom.
               "Ipersoom not," he anserd, liffin up his right leg and stompin airnestly, as mutch
                  as to say he hed put his foot down on that pint.
               I left, the presence with the idee that he hed parshilly detarmined to change his
                  Cabnet, but that passably listed of doln so he mought change his mind.
               Thars a tremenjus outside preshur agin Halleck, to witch Ime inklined to bleve
                  that sellybrated pontoonist will hev to suckum. He was considerd an ornyment to
                  the legal perfesshin, I hev onderstud, and it is ginrally thort that he's better
                  calkelated to jine issoo in an ackshin at lor than on the feeld of mortal
                  conflick.
               I hev it from good orthority that Ginral Butler is to go back to the Cresent City,
                  whar the Secesh is fairly spilin for want of a little of his hullsum dizzyplin
                  They air gittin crazy at his absens, and it seems, they hev ben tryin to shoot
                  Ginral Bankrs for useupping his place. Thar ken be no dout that they would receive
                  him with open arms. The opinyun here is that Stanton was jelus of his popalarity
                  at New Orleans, and that he was remooved on that ackount.
               I hev a noshin of returnin to New York arter the Collective Intelligence
                  disburses, onless you particklerly wish me to remane. My frend Abrahamn ses he
                  kant spare me nohow; but I misstrust he flatters. It would sartainly cost me
                  considabul of a pang to tare myself away from him, but then its hard to live in
                  Gomorrow for the sake of enjyin the sosity of wun rightyus purson. The morril
                  atmostfear of this city is so ongodly bad that the prenceples of a saint mought
                  git tainted by inhelling it too long. Hopin to escape the prevalin criminal
                  epidemic witch is daily carryin off thousands (and in fatck tens of thousands), I

                        I ken seze and imprison and shute."
                     
                  
               
               But thars no caws for alarm, notwithstandin the loud crows of the Abelishinists.
                  The Nayshin is not goin to giv up the goste, bekase its Constitooshin is brokin.
                  Abraham the First is no Nero. He wouldn't hurt a fly. It is troo that the
                  cornskripshin Act, the Bank and Lone Acts, the suspenshin of the Heaviest Corpus
                  Act, the Indamnity Act, and cetery, make a reglar Siezer of him, but his Majest—I
                  mean his Eggsellency—is not the man to take advantidge of the late ginral and
                  genrus sirrender of the rights of the States and the peeple. His auntycedents is
                  not of an aristocratick carrickter. Let us glanst at em for a moment.
               Born of tall but modest patients in Kaintucky, he took, at an airly peryud of his
                  carear to the woods, whar he slung a nasty ax and mauled rails with wunderful
                  assidooity. Emergin thence he studded navigashin on board a flat-boat of the
                  largest class, makin hisself thurrowly ackwainted with the theory of the currents
                  and persishin of the poles. Naterally inklined to push ahed—witch is allus the
                  roolin instink of great minds—he abandoned the watery element and took to the bar,
                  and as he grew in wisdum and in stattur gradjally rose to eminence. Finerly that
                  perfound statesman The Honabul Horris Greeley of Chappaquaw, diskivered that my
                  Illustrus Frend was wanted at the head of the Guvernment, and bein put before the
                  peeple, they rode him on a rail inter the Presidenshil Cheer. Kwalified alike by
                  natur and eddicashin to controle the destinees of the most Enlightened Nayshin on
                  the face of the Airth, Congress dun perfeckly right in conferrin on him onlimited
                  power, in this tremenus crysis. Pressing cases reckwires desput remedees—and hens
                  the nesessity for makin Abraham cock of the walk, and placin the Swoord, the Pus
                  and the Press at his disposhal.
               I am awar that sartain fackshus persons pertends not to see the properiety of
                  strong meshurs agin States as isent in rebellyun; but who noes how sun they may be
                  in rebellyun? A stitch in time saves nine, and the saiftest way to pervent peeple
                  from bein seedishus is to sow thar mouths up the moment they begin to grumble.
                  Libty of Speech and Libty of the Press is all very well when the Republick is not
                  in danger, but when it is, ef Oriturs and Eddyturs will pitch inter the
                  Administrashin, in coarse they must eggspect to be shet up. Is it a time I ax, to
                  pertest agin the Constitooshin bein suspended when the Union itself is hangin by
                  ilids? Away with setch Old Fogey thorts, onwurthy of the Age of Progress! While
                  the fight lasts let us submit magnannymously to the Hyer Law.
               Besides as I hev repetedly sed on former ockashins, the Modern Father of his
                  Kentry is of a mild and mutherly nater, and overflowin with the milk of human
                  kindness from his toenails to his top-knot. Altho he hes a jiant's power he is the
                  last man on the footstool to use it like a jiant. Ennyboddy who looks back at his
                  perceedings doorin the last two ears will admit that. But like the sellybrated
                  Blunderbore who went to sleep and bed his Seven Legged boots stole by an owdashus
                  dwarf, thars sum reson to fear that he'll be robbed of his perogatives by a Cabnet
                  thats rayther too mutch inklined to ride ruff-shod over the peeple. I don't see
                  for my pairt wot he wants with Constitooshinal Advisers onder the suckemstances.
                  Ef the Constitooshin is suspended why shouldent the Constitooshinal Advisers be
                  suspended too?
               Wun thing I ken say to my fellow kentrymen in this momentuous epock of the
                  Nayshin's History. Our cheef shall not suffer for want of paytryotic counsel.
                  Fortnitly I hev not lost his confidens and affeckshin. He bleves in me as mutch as
                  I bleve in him. "D. V.," ses he to me yestday as he was signin bills at the
                  Capital, "will you continny to stand by me onder these new responsabilities?"
                  "Will a duck swim?" I replied—"Will a demagog lie? Will a sutler cheat?" 
                     
                        "Will a sunflower turn to her god when he sets,
                        The same look that she turnt when he rose?"
                     
                   He was satisfid, and went on signin with a lively air.
               The Sennit, in extree sesshin, is grindin out extree Bragadear and Major Ginrals,
                  with extrornary dispatch. I spose, howsever, as it will take em a week or ten
                  days, to put the hull batch throo the mill. Sum of the candydates doosent no
                  gunpowder from union seed, nor a howitstir from a hominy mortar; but I reckin
                  they'll all pull throo. A milentary offsir from New York told me tuther day, that
                  a fresh-made Bragadear had applied to him for a reliabul sargent to teech him the wurds of cummand and how to dror up his
                  corpse in order of battle. Ef enny boddy douts this fack I ken furnish the name of
                  the eppyletted ignoramus. He hales from a sartain commershil emporyum that you are
                  tolably well ackwainted with.
               We hev rummers here of a big fight near Savannah, and sevral uther shindies, but
                  they peer to be got up merely to stuff newshungry citysins, and kant be traced to
                  enny vorashus sorce.
               Hopin to hear of unexpected victries, and trustin that Providence will pay no
                  attenshin to the Secesh Fast ordered by that retched Farisee, Jeff Davis, I
                  remain,

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINTON, March 12, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Thars ben a lively shower of sholder-stops senst my last, and the clouds hes
                  vanisht from the brows of menny milentary asspirants nominated by the President,
                  as was afeard thar rain would be cut short by the Sennit; but, with the eggsepshin
                  of a small sprinklin, they have all been snaked throo, as I perdicted they would.
                  The enthuizyasm for the Stars and Stripes is butiful to behold—I mean the stars as
                  denotes Bragadears and Major Ginrals, and the stripes as signifies subordinit
                  offsirs. Ef thar was the same paytryotic competishin for places in the ranks, a
                  millyun of men mought be razed in six weeks without a cornskripshin. As it is
                  ginrally sposed that a fine livin ken be pickt up in the Subsistens Department,
                  the anksity of the citysins nominated for that branch of the comesharit hes ben of
                  the most vilent carrickter; but thar minds is now trankwill, the hull batch hevin
                  ben confirmt. The paytryotic harts of the candydates for places in the
                  Kwartermaster's Department hes also ben sot at rest in the same way, and the bar
                  rums of the prenceple hottels is raidyant with the smilds of the new
                  appintease.
               Ef the guverment wants to make the cornskripshin lor as poplar as setch a
                  stringgent meshur ken be made, let em apint paytryotic sojers as hes ben disabeld
                  in battle, as provost-marshils. Ef they set a passel of misabul pollytickle
                  lowcusses, as would fly from powder and steal like a theef from a perleecemen, to
                  wurk cornskriptin the bone and sinner, thar'll be trubble in the wigwam as shoor
                  as the President's a cannondrummist. I told him so this very mornin. Ses I, "may
                  it please your Eggsellency, ef you want to put the cornskipshin throo, you must
                  take your provost marshils from the Bang-whangers of the Army and not
                  from the Slang-whangers of party cabawls. With a jester intended to
                  convey the idee that thar was nuthin green in his eye, he remarkt in reply that
                  "retches whoos oney objeck in hevin a hand in the draft was to raze the wind,
                  would be keerfully left out in the cold." He thort, howsever, that it wouldent be
                  a good plan to employ crippeld heroes in the cornskripshin bizness, "Bekase", ses
                  he, "the site of a feller-critter that hes lost an arm or a leg on the battle
                  feeld is not calkilated to put down the too prevailing predjewdice agin balls and
                  bagnets."
               His Eggsellency onderstands sum fazes of the human mind remarkabul well; but ef he
                  thinks setch trifuls as that can repress the nayshinal arder, he onderates the
                  grit of the American peeple.
               In my opinyun the cornskipts will be more afeard of not getten thar pay reglar and
                  bein compeld to eat hard tack, than of the horsteal foe. I hev advised the
                  President to see that the entire army now in the field is paid in full, afore he
                  issoos his proclamashin for bringing anuther batch up to the bull-ring. "Send the
                  paymasters round to evry brigade", ses I, "and pay evry sojer up to the last dime,
                  and the letters they'll rite hum to thar frends will reckonsile em to the
                  approachin raffel for recrutes. The det of gratitood witch the kentry owes the
                  army, ken never be paid," ses I, "but the munny ken. Ef the greenbacks hes run
                  out," I added," let the guverment presses be sot to wurk and a stack of em
                  suffishent for the porpus be ground out without delay. "My argyment on this pint
                  head the desired effeck. His Eggsellency drew forth his wallet and took a solem
                  oath onto it that evry bluecoat should hev his greenbacks right away. So if the
                  hull army is paid off within a munt, which I think it will be, that act of justis will be doo to
                  my intersesshin with my eggsalted frend.
               Arter torkrin this meshunr inter him, I shode him a peace of hard tack, presented
                  to me by a pickit who hed broke three of his teeth in attempttnn to crack it, and
                  axed ef that was the kinder provender to mkee the cornskipshin poplar amung
                  abel-bodded men. His Eggsellency took a snap at it, but with all the leverage he
                  could put onto his mastercaterers, he dident perdooce a dent in its surfiz. Wot
                  the geologists calls "puddin stone" would be saft chamin and a cumfurt to the
                  teeth in caparison with that speciment of hard tack, and arter seein it I ken
                  eesily bleeve the airtickrle is used by the sojers for playin at coits in
                  preference to horseshoes.
               "Now," ses I, takin the addermantin fragment from the President's hands and shyin
                  it at the marbel mantle in his sanktum without splenterin it—I mean without
                  splenterin the biskit—"jest replace this granit grub with sumnthin that doosent
                  distress the jaws and lasserate the gums, and skrape the throte and tare the linin
                  of the stummick, and you will find it like bred cast upon the waters that is found
                  arter menny days."
               "Well," ses he, "as hard tack doosent seem to be the rite tack, Ile go on another
                  tack. Stanton shall see to it that the sojers is furnisht with crisp hulsumn
                  crackers, ef thars honest bakers to be found in the kentry thatt'll supply em at a
                  fare price." I hope it will be dun. I no the Presidlent doosent wish the
                  abel-bodided men of the republick, atwixt the ages of twenty and forty-five, to be
                  redooced to a few snaggs apeace when the war is conclooded; but I hev no confidens
                  in the war department.
               "Punktual Pay" and "No Hard Tack" is now the watchwurds in evry camp, and ef the
                  evils complained of is remedid,, I feel sartain that the Army will rite so
                  incurredgingly to thar relashuns and frends to hum, as to prevent all trouble, in
                  carryin out the cumming Proclamashin. How present it would be to see the Provost.
                  Marshils reseved evrywhars with opin arms, and crownt with lorils, and serenaded,
                  and presented with sarvices of plate in evry city and town of the North. Betch a
                  result ken oney be accomplisht by reglar payments and saft biskit. Let us hope the
                  jint eggsperiment will be tried.
               Bleven you will goinside with me in the abuv hastily written vews on grub and
                  greenbacks, I remain, as formerly,

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, March 19, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The kentry will larn with astonishment that the distingwished Treason-tamer as
                  recently rooled like a Grand Turk in the Cressent City, and eggspected the warm
                  birth of Cornskripter-Ginral, hes ben left out in the cold by an ongratefool
                  Administrashin. In uther words, 
                     
                        To Butler, of the droopin eye,
                        Our fat frend Stanton, he warnt parshil,
                        And as he's dished, and Kernil Fry
                        Will rool the roast as Provost-Marshil.
                     
                  
               
               Fry is a good man, howsever, and will endeavor to eggsersize his stewpendus
                  progatives in such a way as not to embrile the milentary with the civil
                  orthoritles. I dont bleve Ginral Butler is match disappinted. They do say he
                  kinder hankers arter the Presidenshil Cheer, and ef so he must be awar that in
                  consekens of the depravity of human nater, compellin the masses to go a sojerin
                  agen thar will is not the shoorest way to enlist thar affeckshins. The Deestrick
                  Marshils is to be appointed immediently, and the first great milentary
                  raffel—witch will probly be for hafe a millyun or six hunderd thousand of the
                  abelbodded—will cum off, it is thort, about the last of April. Atwixt this and
                  then I calkrilate as the popalashin of Canady will increese in a most onrighteus
                  raysho. In coarse sentinels will be stashind on the frontear, to stop the tide of
                  emigrashin, but the Saint Lorrence is a long river, and American enterprize is
                  proverbyal. Menny would rayther paddle acrost that broad and rapid streem on a
                  stick of timber, than attempt the passidge of the smooth and narrer Rapperhammock with all the
                  fasilitles of transportashin afforded by a wise and saygashus guvermant. I hope
                  you will do your best to discurridge this idee of crossing the frontear, and that
                  even the scariest will sun git over it. Let the American peeple imitate the valor
                  of their annsisters in this momentuous crysis. The tremenjus shindy drors to a
                  close. Gold is at six hundred per cent premum in Richmound, while we hev enny
                  kwantity of the preshus mettle witch lends strenth to the sinners of war. The
                  rebels is alreddy like reeds shaken by the wind, and with the new draft we ken
                  blow em to thunder. O! that I was a poick. Then would I strike the lyre with a
                  vigger that should rouse all troo men. Even as it is, onfamilyar as I am with the
                  Mewses, I must run my tumultyus felines inter a standsir: 
                     
                        Paytryits! when summent from your houses,
                        Go gladly to the rendezvouses,
                        And ef you dror a fightin ticket
                        Go in agen Secesh and lick it.
                        Too long in doubt weve sithed and sorrerd,
                        But now we'll put our best foot forrard.

                        Shell stop this everlatstin brile.
                        Our kentry is a blessed stake,
                        And we'll resk pepper for its sake.
                        Eggscuse my rimes—ef false I tune em,
                        And here's God bless Old E. P. Unum.
                     
                  
               
               The capter of wun of our bully Bragadears and his staff at Fairfacts tuther: day,
                  created considabul sensashin here. The gravest vetrans smiled, and not a few was
                  mooved to tears by thar oncontrolabul larfter. The Father of his Kentry got off a
                  godd thing on the occashin; for setch is his happy temperament that he ken turn
                  enny calamity inter a joak. (Not as this was a calamity, tho; far from it.) His
                  eggsellency, on heering of the raid, remarkt that carryin off our Stoughton was a
                  pruff that the rebels intended to carry on the war to the bitter eend. I notis the
                  papers state that the rebels gin the Bragadear time to dress. Thie is a cunard
                  invented by the modest tellagrafter who was ashamed to tell the naked truth. The
                  night was wunderful cold for setch a nary costoom, but he was acktilly placed onto
                  a hard trottin hog-backt cornfederit mule, with nuthin atwixt his delicut
                  cuetickle. and the vertebry of the animil. Naterally he was greatly chafed at this
                  kinder treatment, but remonsterance was in vain. And this warnt his obey
                  mortificashin; for arter they hed sot him astride, Miss Ford, the fair Delily as
                  betrayed him, cum up in full dress, hangin on the arm of a Secesh catptin, and
                  axed him how he fanasid, the South Caroliny uniform, and wether he would like to
                  complealt it by puttin on a par of spurs! They rode him twenty-five milds strait
                  ahed without enny intermishin for refreshments, and arter that splendid act of
                  horsemanship on a bare-backed steed, his condishin may be more eesily imadjined
                  than described. I gess that midnight ride onder setch melancolly awespices will be
                  a sore spot for him all the rest of his life; for he's sartain never to hear the
                  last of it. In coarse it is nuts to the she rebel, who hes ben made a kernil in
                  consekens. Seward, who isent alltogether as dull a purson as you would spose from
                  some of his dispatches, allows that Stoughtons capter was the greatest Misstake of
                  the war.
               We hev a new batch of rummers evry day from all pints of the cumpass, and as they
                  air all prented, you pays your munney and you takes your chice. Upon the hull,
                  howsever, the American Egul peers to be lookin up. It is ginally bleved that
                  Vicksburg is on the pint of bein evacyated, end I hev no doubt we shall soon hev
                  noose that Ferrygurt hes opened a passidge below. The nex things on the keards is
                  the fall of Charlestun, and then wont we all sing Tedium?
               Awaiting impayshently the airliest intelligens of the abuvmenshint events, I

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, March 26, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The President looks ankshus. When I called on him this mornin I found him lost in
                  thort and fancid I observed a new
                  rinkel. As I enterd the sanktumu he inklinedl his head with his ushil swervety,
                  but his mind was evidently utherwhars.
               "How air you Hilton Hed," ses he; "do you think it will be the wisest coarse for
                  you and Bufort to sail on the First of April?"
               "Your eggsellency's intelleck is rayther at sea," I remarkt, "but I perceeve how
                  the land lays; your paytryotic slissitood about Charlestun hes upset your organ of
                  lowcality."
               "Blame these Hemlocks," he continued, makin moshins with his hands as ef he was
                  pullin down and choppin off the lims of trees; "we've got to a purty pass here in
                  the Yazoo, and ef the Sunflower Branch is as snaggy as the Yaller Bushy, Porter'll
                  rip no lorils in that kwarter, I'm afeard. He thinks he ken redooce the Bluff, but
                  it isent on the keards, onless Quimby goes like thunder and lightning throo the
                  Cold Water."
               "Father of your kentry," ses I, pinchin his arm respeckfully, "you labor wonder a
                  lucynashin; mutch wurryin about the war hes made you flighty."
               But he took no notis, so puttin my mouth closte to his ear I shouted,
                  "Villaindigham!" He started as ef he'd ben bit by a copperhed, and turnt to ring
                  the bell for help, but seeing who it was, he grasped my hand insted of the bell
                  pull, and as ef thar was eelecktrissity in the tutch, immediently becum himself
                  agen.
               "D. V.," ses he confidenshally, "I've ben studdyin maps and plans of the varyus
                  seats of war ontil my crannyum feels like a teerestral globe rong side out, and it
                  peers to me as ef all the seeports and ismusses, and peninslurs, and crooked
                  rivers, and cetery, hed got loose and was dancing quaydrills in the intellectooal
                  region. I am suffering from an attack of milentary jografy on thie brain.
               "It doosent do, my illustrus frend," I replide, "to pore over setch matters too
                  clostely; I cum purty nigh becummin at loonatick myself, with tryin to understand
                  the Herald's diegramss of Admaril Porter's operashins. I hed to call in a
                  fizzishin, and he pernounst the disorder to be a rush of Mussysippi to the
                  cerebedlam. He sed ef I didn't stop takin the paper I would purty sun have Yazoo
                  on the oxiput, and mought never live to see Vicksburg demolisht."
               "Ah!" refined the Peeple's Chice, "the strongest mind may be overtaskt. I no by
                  paneful eggsperience, as well as A. Pope, that 
                     "Great wit to madness nearly is a lied."
                  
               
               "In the words of the poick Rodgers," he continned,
                     
                        "Lost in the muzzy chambers of the brain,
                        The thorts lie husht like sleepers on a train.
                        Awake but one, and lo! what myriads rise,
                        To buzz around like bumble-bees and flies."
                     
                  
               
               "From wot pome is that butiful standsir kwoted," I axed.
               "From the 'Pleshurs of Memry,'" anserd his Eggsellency.
               "And let me tell you, D. V.," he added, with a self-contented smild, "thar's no
                  Pleshurs on airth like the Pleshurs of Memry, when a man can look back on his past
                  life without bein conshus of evor hevin committed a blunder."
               Our conversashin then turnt upon perlite literatoor ginally, and arter enjoyin "a
                  feast of resin and a flow of sole" for about hafe an hour, I left the White House
                  with the convickshin that what President Lincoln dident no, warnt wuth knowin to
                  the past or to futur sentries.
               On my way from the Presidenshil Manshin to the Nayshinal, I met the paytryotic
                  William H. of the State Department, and told him wot our beloved Cheef Madgistrit
                  hed sed about "jografy on the brain", upon witch the Seckatry remarkt that it was
                  not strange Mr. Lincoln was bothered with maps runnin in his head, when he'd the
                  burden of Atlas restin on his sholders. I dident see it at first; but W. H was
                  kind enuff to eggsplain that a feller of the name of Atlas, who acted as a kinder
                  tickret porter to Jewpter, was sposed by the Ainshents to tote the wurld around on
                  his backr. As sun as I got the joak throo my har I larfed perlitely, and the
                  Seckatry went off more perfeckly satisified with hisself than the nashin at large
                  is with his offishal dispatches.
               The Coonstitooshinal Advisers, with the eggsepshin of the abuv, and Mr. Chase, who
                  is jestly elated with his resent Wall street victries, looks haggard and perplext.
                  The figger-hed of the Seckatry of the Navy doosent ware that trim and ship-shape
                  aperience that his frends would wish io see. His mane-top is not all-a-taunto as
                  it used to be, and his chin-halliards hangs as loose and limpy as a peace of sail
                  that hes ben blowed outer the boltropes and got cort in the riggin wonder the
                  lubber's hole. His deshrivelled aspeck is doo, pairtly, I persoom, to the late
                  axidents on the Suthern coast, and pairtly to the faller of his skreems for
                  ketchin the letters of mark witch at present infests the mail rout to Californy.
                  When Charlestun is ourn, and the Alabammer, Florida, and Retribushin blown to
                  thunder, I dessay he'll brush up and be as good as new. He's a wurthy man, but
                  rayther too drowsy ef ennything for navel porpuses in stormy times. Its a pity he doosent retire, and return to
                  Hartford to enjoy his ocean cum digitalis. The Seckatry of War
                  is wun of the most curus specktickles you ever seen. His countenance seems as ef
                  it wanted to be jolly, but warn't kwite sartin wether the time had arrived for the
                  larf to cum in. He hes the aspeck of a man looking throo a glass darkly at futur
                  events, with a mind distracted atwixt his hopes and his fears.
               I hope, however, that within the next fortnight we shell hev noose that'll make
                  both the Cabnet and the Peeple jump for joy, and bring back the old familiar
                  twinkel intel the ankshus eyes of my nobul friend Abraham Lincoln.
               Wishin as evry Nuthern man had as lyal a hart as him and me, I remain, with a cuss
                  for all Copperheds,
               
                  Yours allus,

                     bear twice readin—once for its sarcasm, and again for the fervent patriotism

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, April 2, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The doste of bad noose we hev hed doorin the past week hes operated onfavorable
                  here. The Seckatry of War is on the ankhus seat, and the evacyashin of Vicksburg
                  would be a great releef to him. Ef Porter hed ben abel to git throo the narrer gut
                  that seperates Lake Sunflower from the Yazoo, it would hey ben more encurredgin;
                  but it seems the obstruckshins is too formadouble for him to push throo. This, in
                  coarse, is a bitter pill, and it is purty hard to stummick it, but ef by the
                  blessing of Hevin our troops ken go in transports throo the Providence Canawl
                  inter the enemee's rare, they must sun be redooced to thar last shifts. Water is
                  also lowin freely throo the canawl in frunt it seems, and ef wunst we begin to let
                  it fly at em both from the frunt and rare, I should spose they would speedily be
                  overwhelmed. By consultin the latest diegrams it will be seen that they air in a
                  tight fix—cort, as it ware, atwixt Silly and Charibadibs—and I raaly dont see enny
                  caws for the melancolly aspeck witch the Cabnet hes worn for sum days past. But
                  Public Funkshinaries is eesily deprest.
               No dout we shell hev stirrin intelligents from the Suthern Coste afore long; tho
                  sum of the spooneys in the Navy Department peers to be afeard that Dupont's iron
                  plates will be smasht by the Charlestun batterees. By the way, it isent by no
                  means sartain as Charlestun is to be the pint of a tack. Menny think as our iron
                  screws will first hammer down Savanner. But noboddy actilly nose whar the bolt
                  will fall. Anuther week at furthest will tell the story. In the meentime, let us
                  put our trust in the Lord, ef not in Giddyun.
               In Kaintucky things look promisin. Peagrim hes ben shelled outer his persishin.
                  The turn-up took place near Summerset, whar our brave Ginral Gilmore gin him a
                  lofty fall. Onless the telagram lies—witch it sumtimes doos like thunder and
                  lightnin Peagrim's raid inter Old Kaintuck is nockt eendways by the Union forces a
                  raid agin him.
               On tuther hand, howsever, Ginral Bragstun Brag reports to Richmound that Ginral
                  Forrest hes made a dash at Brentwood in West Tenassee, and bagged eight hunderd of
                  our men and thirty-five offsirs. Brag is remarkabul for mendashus statements, so
                  mebbe the reported capter is a misstake. Ef troop, I persoom the detachtment was
                  supprised in thar night-gownds, takin a refreshin snooze with thar heads pillerd
                  on thar nap sacks. Setch oneggspected and ongenerus visits from the enemee
                  frekwently occurs in our camps, and sarves to sho that they hev no respeck for the
                  rools and regalashins of civileysed warfare. To attack our milentary boddies when
                  asleep, is a knockturnal outrage on the manors and custums of an enlightend
                  age.
               A startlin report from Yorktown hes jest flasht over the wires. It is stated that
                  the seecesh is pitchin inter us at Williamsburg like a thousand of bricks, or
                  rayther like twenty thousand bricks, for that is sed to be thar numbers. Ginral
                  Keys, who cummands our forces at Yorktown, was at Fortress Monro when the ball
                  opent, and it is sed he tore his locks when he heerd the noose and vamosed
                  immediently in a steamboat for the seen of the shindy. I sor him on Pennsylvany
                  avenoo oney day before yestday, and Washington not bein more'n a hunderd milds
                  from his head-kwarters, it was kinder nateral, you no, for him to be here when the
                  enemee was moovin to a tack his persishin, Warnt Wellington at Brussils when the
                  fightin began in the neybrood brood of
                  Waterloo, and dont our ginrals all take pattern arter the Iron Dook. Ef you should
                  happen to here afore Sunday that Williamsburg hes ben tuck, be sure to menshin
                  that Ginral Keys was at his post in time to pardizzypate in the defeet.
               The reports about the enemee retreatin from the Rapperhammock is all bolderdash.
                  Ginral Hooker nose better, and jest as sun as the sile on the banks will support
                  his legins, he will order the bugles to sound and go in like a trump. Hooker is
                  all grit and grissel from his corns to his coconut. Sum thinks he's not up to the
                  fancy dodges of a brilyant retreat, and I think its likely, for he's not of a
                  retirin dispersishin. Ef the Gardin of Edin was behint him and the infernal

               The pollytishins here is considabully eggsersized about the cummin eleckshin in

                  Seckatry Welles is dubyus. Howsever, he doosent no the State as well as the State
                  nose him, so he may be rong. For my own pairt, Ime willin to bet high—say Guvner

                  to vote. Wouldn't they aim thar ballots whar they allus aim thar bullets, right at
                  the face and eyes of treason! Wal, I reckin they would! Its too bad, while the
                  brave fellers is smashin Seceshinists in the feeld, that the Concesshinists should be helpin Jeff Davis to hum; but I kant bleve but wot the

                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The Copperhed collaps in Conneticut hes cut the combs of concesshinist cusses in
                  the Capital considabully, and ef Hunter and Dupont suckseeds in the hard brush
                  cummin off on the Suthern coste, it will leve nuther bar nor hide of the
                  Cumproimmis party in these diggins.
               I notis as the old rats of the New York World is allreddy puttin off from the
                  sinkin Secesh raft, "wun eend of witch," as the eddytur navely obsarves, "is onder
                  water in Conneticut." As WOOD was on that eend of the timber, together with all
                  his fuglemen and the Eggspress agent of the consarn, I spose they may be considerd
                  as heving all gon to Davis Locker. Honabul Thomas Henry Seemore the blind pilot of
                  the onfortnit castaways, is sartainly "down among the ded men." Findin it was no
                  use to struggle agen destiny, he threw up his hands, and sirrenderd hisself to his
                  fate, eggsclaiming as he went onder, So much for BUCKINGHAM!"
               Ef ennything was wantin to give the deth blo to the "Nuthern men with Suthern
                  principals", the mistake they made in holdin entervews with Lions, the British
                  Plenipenitentiary, would do the job. Lions ses they told him thar mane hope was in
                  British mediashin; in uther wurds, they wanted Victory to interfear to save thar
                  Suthern frends from defeat. You oughterprent the letter of the British Envy on the
                  subjeck, in the collumes of the SUNDAY MERKARY, for it prooves beyant all kwestin,
                  that the feeders of the Peace Party in New York is the meanest set of bootlicks that ever glued thar dirty
                  tungs to British lether.
               Judgin from the resent wimmins riot in Richmound, things is tendin to a crysis in
                  Jeffland. The Amazins, it seems, was wedded by a lady in independent
                  suckemstances, and as might naterally be sirmised, they attacted the millindary
                  establishments and dry goods stores with desput fury. They hysted a banner baring
                  the inskripshin, "Bunnets or Blood", and went inter the fray with horrid hoops and
                  hidyus yells. Arter takin the dry goods establishments by storm, they dressed thar
                  ranks, and assailed the skeart factories, exposin thar pursons in the most
                  fearless manner, and carryin all before em. Crossin Shockoh Crick, they marched
                  agin the modests in the fashinabul pairt of the city, and tho an attemp was made
                  to barricade the streets, the breslworks did not for a moment impede thar
                  progress. Thar crownin feet was to mount all the tallest stiles in French hats,
                  arter witch they consented to listen to a speetch from Jeff Davis, who gin his
                  word of honor to supply em with French rolls and omlets evry mornin for brekfast,
                  at his own expens; arter witch they kwitely disburst. Altho thar skellinton forms
                  bore witness to thar destitooshin, it is an astonishin fack that as sun as the
                  rampage among the silks and ribbins and cetery began, they entirely forgot thar
                  stummicks, and it was not ontil Jeff began to tork to em about provishins that
                  they remembered thar famalies was starvin. Thar wardrubs bein now thurrowly
                  replenisht, it is thort that they will not feel inklined to fly to arms agin afore
                  the Fall Fashins is advertised.
               The report of the Committee on the Conduck of the War is mutch disgust in
                  pollytickle sirkles here. Maclellin is denounst, as a Ginral thing. Menny thinks
                  he was a leetle mite overcawshus. He seems to hev ied a great respeck for the
                  milentary rool that a Cummander-in-chief shouldn't resk his life onnessarily. Sum
                  allows that he rayther run the idee inter the ground, and was so ankshus not to
                  hev his plans deranged by any axdent to hisself, that it made him peer ridickalus.
                  Uthers represents that altho brave as a lion, he is of a narvous temperament, and
                  consekently doosent like to go inter the noise and turmoil of an engagement for
                  fear of loosin his hed and bein onabul to give his orders clarly. For my own pairt
                  I regaird him as a fine man in an onfortnit persishin; but as the report of the
                  Committee is a breef dockyment of oney seven thousand pages, in coarse evry man
                  will read it for hisself and form his own opinyun. I raaly wouldn't hev bleved
                  that it could hev ben cumprest inter nearly the same space as Bancroft's History
                  of the United States, witch it doosent eggseed more'n two or three vollums.
               The Guvernment is in hourly eggspectashin of larnin that Charlestun is an ash
                  heap; but I am not kwite so sangwinary. After all the time the rebels hes hed for
                  obstructin the channels, to say nuthin of all the forts bein cased with pig iron,
                  they must be poor shoats ef they cant keep us at bay for sum time to cum. Thars no
                  dout, I spose, that our Monitors will giv em a lessin in the eend, but theyve got
                  a tuff rod in pickle for us, and our gunboats will get menny a hard spank afore
                  the shindy's over.

                  as sum of our offishal foo-foos sposed, hes ben moanfully foolfilled, and our
                  false profits air considabully taken down by the ackounts from that kwarter.
                  Seckatry Welles looks bewilderd, like a man suddently awoke from a plesent vishin
                  by a cry of fire. It is roomered that his intelleck is givin way, but I don't
                  think thars enny solid foundashin for the report. In reply to those who condole
                  with him on the misfortin, he merely ses he "eggspected the reverse", witch is a
                  fack or a fickshin accordin to the sense in witch you take the anser. The truth is
                  that the Illustrus Minister and Mariner hed an idee that the Charlestun forts would cave in
                  arter hafe a duzzen rounds or so, and it was oney when he heard of the sinkin of
                  the Keocuck that he reelized the rebels was reddy for the Tug of War. Ginrall
                  Halleck, whenever the subjeck is menshint in his hearin, assooms the attitood of
                  Ajacks defyin the lighthin, and ef tall torkin could conker the Secesh strongholt,
                  huthin more would be reckwisit than to send that distingwisht speshil pleeder to
                  the Charlestun Bar. It is sed that sumboddy axed him tuther day why them I seven
                  thousand men was hurrid off on a fool's eratt to Folly Island, and wot they was
                  eggspected to do agin five milds of forts mounted with a thousand cannon and
                  fifty-five thousand rebel bagnets reddy to give it to em hot and heavy at the
                  uther eend of the cool de sack, I dont no wot reply the
                  galliant Atturney-Ginral—I call him so bekase he was an Atturney prevus to bein a
                  Ginral—made to this important kwestin, but I onderstand the troops was sent on to
                  see how almity kwick thirty-two guns could smash a line of works stronger'n
                  Sebasterpull, onder a corncentrickle fire from three hundred rifled peaces at a
                  distans of seven hunderd yerds. It was thort the spectickle would be encurridging
                  to the land forces, and inspire em with no eend of ardor and devoshin; but as it
                  turnt out, they went back reflectin serously on the onsartinty of accomplishin
                  onpossabilities.
               The modern Father of his Kentry is cam and composed wonder the late dispensashin.
                  He says it was "not a repulse—oney a check". Prehaps he means a
                     check-mate, for my nobul frend offen conseals sumthin redickalus
                  wonder his gravest remarks. Happenin to ketch his egul eye as he stood on the
                  stare-way of the War Department to-day, he beckont, me too him, when the follerin
                  dialog ensood:
               "Honabul Abe," ses I, "wot do you think of the problem of iron-clad
                  involnerability?"
               "Disbanded," he replied, "it is a problem no longer—the rebels hes riddled
                  it."
               "But accordin to Ericson," I remarkt, "the new fightin masheens wurkt percisely as
                  intended. He considders em a sucksessful eggsperiment."
               "That's nateral," rejoined the President, "I dessay the three navigaters of Gotham
                  as went on a crews in a bowl, crackt up their craft as a first rate speciment of
                  navel holler-ware."
               "He ses," I continued, "that our attact on Sumter was 'fraught with incalkalable
                  benefit.'"
               "Assalting to no porpus, and gettin an orful pepperin in return, doosent seem to
                  me like getting the best of the brile," he anserd.
               "That's troo," ses, "and I think you hed better rite to the Gentman from Denmark,
                  and ax himn ef he wont dane to eggsplane his meanin. He's a skyentific feller," I
                  added, "no kwestin about that; but he was ekwilly confident about his atmusferic
                  ship, witch howsever proved a thing of air and arter a few puffs from the press
                  sobsided with an asmlatic wheeze inter oblivyun."
               "I remember it, D. V., I remember it," remarkt the President thortfully, "and that
                  affair oughter have ben a monitor to the nashin, caushinin us not to put too much
                  faith in new projecks from the same kwarter."
               "Now you go too fur," I subjested, "the new stile of ironclads is ondoutedly good
                  things in thar way, and ef thar imperfeckshins ken be remooved they will do good
                  service under sartain contingenseas. Wot I objeck to is the assershin of the
                  inventor that 'not a single change of plan is called for.'"
               Our saygasheus Cheef Madgistrit agreed with me, as ushil, and the upshot of the
                  matter is that the armor of the new Monitors is to be made thick enuff to stand
                  enny kwantity of hits from the biggest kind of missills, and ef the addishunal
                  weight carries em down at thar moorins, we must let the invenshin slide, and
                  charge the expens to the sinkin fund. Ef we sink the hull thars more whar that
                  cums from, and we know rall thunderin well thars ten times as mutch whar it will
                  go to.
               We air ankshusly lookin for intellegens from North Caroliny, and I rather imadgin
                  that when it arrives it will be of the illstarred South Caroliny stripe—in uther
                  words onfavorabul to the Stripes and Stars. Ef the sevin thousand Union troops
                  that was despatched from Hilton Hed to chaw up the fifty-five thousand rebels at
                  Charlestun, had ben sent to Ginral Foster, he mought hev licked his assailants,
                  instead of bein as he is at present, cooped up on a tung of land, and in the jaws
                  of destruckshin. I persoom he will meet with what my illustrus paytrun would call
                  a "check "—on the banks of the Tar.
               But notwithstandin the imbesillyty that prevails at head kwarters, the good caws
                  is bound to cum out right in the eend. With strong faith in the kentry, but not a

               Things looks a leetle brighter for our blessed old Unkel E. P. Unum, this week,
                  dont they? Ginral Foster got outer his skrape better'n thar was enny resin to
                  andissipate, and the public mind here, arter bein wurked up to a tearable pitch,
                  hes at lenth been sot at rest by the result of the late hevvy brush on the Tar.
                  The intelligens from the Blackwater, that Peck hed carrid his pint was also
                  receved with onmeshered satisfackshin at Head Kwarters. Peck is a wurthy sun of
                  the Empire State and like her'n his notto is Excel Sir. A better sojer never drawd
                  a swoord, and Old Onadagger hes a right to brag on him. I hope the way he salted
                  Longstreet's advance will be apresheated in Syracuse. The fact is when Longstreet
                  crost the Blackwater, and D. H. Hill started from tuther side of the Dismal Swomp
                  to meet him, they thort they hed Suffolk shoor. The two together hed sixty
                  thousand of the very flour of the Cornfedrit troops, enuff to suffokate Peck's
                  small corpse by that mere weight, ef they could hev throwd tharselves onto both
                  his flanks at wunst. But he gin Longstreet his grewill mity kwick, and Hill bein
                  onabul onder the suckemstances to advance to his sucker, our victry was complete.
                  About the same time too the secesh was gettin a lanmin from Ginral Getty and
                  Levetenant Lamsen, who stormed thar Nancy Mond brestworks with great ardor and
                  entire suckcess.
               Right on the heals of this good noose cum wurd that Admaril Porter hed run the
                  Vicksburg batterees with six iron-clads and some troops in transports, and
                  astonisht the Butternuts in the woods around Warrenton with a shower of ten-inch
                  shells.
               Simultants with the abuv arrove a short electree-magnetic epistol from the
                  Corinthians, announcing that Ginral Dodge hed ben lettin daylight inter the rebel
                  gentiles near Corinth, and that they hed fled from the rath to cum.
               Even that warnt all, for we heerd the same day from New Orleans per George
                  Washington, that Ginral Emory hed gin the enemy a severe rub in frunt, and that
                  Ginral Weasel bed made a strong demonstrashin on thar rare afore they got scent of
                  his moovements. The probility is they hev ben skunkt. A black detachment likewise
                  peers to hev ben dooin good sarvice in that kwarter. Four hunderd and fifty
                  secesh, consistin of horse foot and dragons, it seems attacted wun hunderd and
                  eighty nigs, eggspectin to chaw em up right away. But the Shiverally as went out
                  for wool cum back shorn, with a loss of twenty killed, menny wounded and three
                  snaked off as prisners, and leavin thar cullers in the hands of the cullerd
                  pursons.
               All this is encurridgin and I feel in fussrate sperrits, and so doos my steamed
                  frend His Eggsellency the President of the United States. Indeed I never seen that
                  great Pollytickle and Milentary Loominary more full of enthusiastick fire, and ef
                  he hedn't gin vent to his felines by admittin Western Virginny into the Union
                  sixty days arter date, I dunno but his senses mought hev ben endangered by a
                  suddent rush of victry to the head. Good tidins from the seat of war is so
                  onfrekwent, that when our troops make a successful dash, the inseargeants ken
                  skarsly be more taken by supprise than we air.
               The sakrid sile, I am happy to say, will soon hev suffishent consistency to allow
                  us to operate with artillery. An a decamp from the Rapperhammock informs me that
                  most of the cannon as sunk inter the moreasses when Burnside boggled in his last
                  attempt, hes ben dug out, and that the river kentry, with the eggsepshin of the
                  fishers opened in the road by heat of the sun, will be in putty good condishun for
                  a march by the last of April. The Army of the Potomac hevin jest ben paid off, is
                  in a happy frame of mind, and the men, though a good deal engaged in brag, air
                  ankshus to face the bullets of the enemy. Thar'll be an everlastin big funeral or
                  a mity rapid foot race in them diggins putty resently. The rebel ginrals eggspect
                  a shindy thar immediently, and Fightin Jo is not the man to disappint thar
                  resinable tho tresinable longins. Ef he doosent warm the wax in thar ears afore
                  the first of May, I think it will be the folt of the struttygists at
                  Washington.
               My heroick paytrun, the nashin's cheef, was delited, doorin his late visit to
                  Ginral Hooker, with the sojerly aperience of the sojers. He witnessed the
                  artillery's shell practis with much satisfackshin, remarkin, in his farseeshus
                  way, that it was ekquil to Oysterlitz. I bleve he intermated a wish at wun time,
                  to take command in purson, and seezin a flag, waved it tords the enemy: but on its bein subjested by sumboddy
                  that "Deth loves a shinin mark", he waved the subjeck. It would be a gloryus sight
                  to see the galliant cheef chargin at the head of the Highland Regiment, in the
                  same Scotch uniform he wore doorin his sellybrated forced march from Philadelphy
                  to Washington. The story about his hevin his rains seezed by insubordinit sojers,
                  who demanded his munny or his life, is altogether ontroo. They simply stopt his
                  carridge, and respeckfully axed him ef he would like to hear em sing, "How air
                  you, Greenbacks?"—a beautiful solow, witch, as yon air awar, was sung with great
                  applause by Bryant of the Evenin Post, at the Minstrel Hall in Broadway, jest
                  arter his troupe got thar fat Guverment offices.
               In referrin to the Presidenshil visit to the Rapperhammock, I oughter menshin that
                  Mrs. Lincoln, like her honnerd husband, was much pleased with the milentary
                  aperience of the milentary. This important fack hes never ben allooded to by the
                  Washington correspondents of your leaden daylies, but I am satisfide it is
                  awethentick.
               Hevin nuthin further of intrest to commoonicate, I send you my blessin, in which
                  the President and the heads of the War and Navy Departments condesendinly concurs,
                  and remain as ushil,

                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Judgin from the way the slashes around Washington is dryin up, the varus army
                  corpses will sun be able to moove without dannger of bein berrid alive in mud.
                  Spring is a breef and summary seesin in these diggins, and altho this is oney the
                  first of May, it is warm enuff to take wuns dejuner in the open
                  air. Yestday I mounted my charger—a butiful dun brown animal persented to me by
                  Ginral Maclellin arter his sevin days retreat from the White House to Hairassin
                  Landin—and tuck a ride inter Prence Georges County, as far as Slygo Crick, a
                  seekwestard sareem as runs a little to the eastard of the Deestrick line. On
                  arrivin at Carols Mill I found the birds singin gaily in the old fields, and
                  evrything lookin peaceful and plesent. Ah! thort I, as I notist a gang of feeld
                  hands standin eatin thar lunch in the corner of a corn patch, how diffrent is this
                  fete shampeter from the fete saltpeter that is goin on on tuther side of the
                  Potomac. Here, I solilykwised, the blacks is plantin corn—thar the whites is
                  plantin cannon—here the slaves is kwietly tendin to thar craps—thar, freemen, in
                  the wurds of the poick, "like rippers descend to the harvest of Deth; here, the
                  coo of the turkle is heerd in the land—thar, evrything is preparin for a
                     coo de main; here, the grass blades is greenly
                  springin—thar, the swoord blades is redly wavin; here, hunderds of fetherd
                  songsters pores forth grateful mewsick—thar, the ear is deefend by the thunderin
                  Parrots; here, man's labor hes a blessed aim—thar, his pershoots is of a holey
                  opposit nater. The corntrast was too affectin to be dwelt on, so wipin away a tear
                  with my hankercher, and at the same time givin my hoss a wipe with the cowskin, I
                  dasht inter the woods at a slappin pace. Hevin resided in Prence Georges for a
                  wile, about thirty years ago, I new the names of a good menny of the old settlers,
                  incloodin the Martens, wun of hoom hes jest ben caged for indulgin in a bit of a
                  crow over Charlestun. I called on sum of the small planters fammalies, and found
                  em rayther poorer'n I left em a score and a hafe years ago; for the sile of the
                  kentry is the ongratefoolest and meenest kinder sand that mullins and broomsedge
                  ever growd on, and the longer a man lives onto it, the more lieabul he is to die
                  of starvashin. The arabul land is so ongodly barren it isent wuth a cuss, and the
                  pastors is all garlick. The inhabitans is a herrin-gutted, slab-sided race, as
                  subsists alltogether on salt shad, salt pork, beans and homany, and Merryland
                  terbacker. In coarse, I dont refer to the big planters, like the Calverts, and
                  Cramplins, and setch, who hev hunderds of niggers of evry shade and culler and
                  stile of feter, and emung the rest, quoderoons as favers thar owners as mutch as
                  wun musheroon favers enuther. Them fellers live like fightin cox, and looks down
                  upon the wun-hoss farmers as skratches for a livin in the barren sand with as
                  mutch contemp as a pecock would onto a tumble-bug. Most all the popalashin,
                     howsever, rich and poor, is of the
                  Rebel perswashin, and would be delited to see Washington in flams, and to ride my
                  lustrus frend Abe on a rail by the light of em. But Ime kinder wanderin off into
                  ginralties. To return. As I was perseedin throo the woods I cum acrost a
                  remarkabul yaller-lookin white man sittin on the stump of a tree he hed jest cut
                  down, and amusin hisself with spittin at a mark he bed blazed onto an old chesnut
                  oak about ten feet off.
               "Wot mought you pay for that cretur of yourn?" ses he, as I rode up.
               "I dident buy him, my yaller flower of the forrest," ses I.
               "You look to me considabul like a Nuthern Mudsill," he remarkt throo his nose, at
                  the same time takin a lickwid shot at his terbacker-juice target.
               "You call yourself a Buckskin, I spose," I replide.
               "Umn-umn," he responded, spittin and noddin at the same moment.
               "Doos that mean yes, in Buckskin dialeck?" I inkwired.
               "Umn-umn!" he rejined.
               "Wal," ses I, "youre kwite right to call yourself a Buckskin, for your peltry
                  peers to be purty near the culler of my old Californy huntin shirt, eggsept whar
                  its warigated with the juce of the weed."
               "Umn-umn!" he ejacklated, fiercely, eggspectoratin like a hose pipe.
               "Have you heerd that we've givin the infarnal Secesh fits at all pints?" I
                  shouted.
               "Umn-umn?" ses he, inderogativly.
               "Darn your 'Umn-umn!'" ses I. "Why don't you utter articklit sounds, insted of
                  makin a noise like a bumble-bee with a bad catar?"
               "Umn-umn!" ses he agin, throwin away his kwid and spittin at it on the wing.
               And that was all I could git outer the interestin young Prence Georgian. I warnt
                  surprised, becase I new by eggsperiens the natur of the Prence George variety of
                  the human speeches, "Umn-umn" is the leadin frays of thar langwidge. It hes
                  twenty-five diffrent meanins, accordin to the way it is pernounst, and the oney
                  wunder to me is that they dont destroy the mewcuss membrains of thar noses, with
                  playin the variashins on it from mornin till night. Thar edicashin, upon the hull,
                  is not pollisht. Sum ken read, sum ken rite, and sum ken doo nuther; but as a
                  ginral thing oney the aristockracy ken doo both. They considder publick skools a
                  poplar error, and that the wisdom got outer books is all a follysee. The males
                  take to chawin immediently arter they hev dun teething, and parsevere in the
                  practis arter all thar teeth is gon. In thar fudes and kwarls they make it a rool
                  never to let a man up ef they ken help it, and air so fond of gouging that they
                  will amuse tharselves all day long with skoopin out the eyes of potaters, ef they
                  kant find ennything else to oprate upon. Sum of em, arter takin out the opticks of
                  an enemee, hev a plesent way of fillin the orifizzes up with sand, or, ef
                  convenient, with old sojers. I wunst seen this feet performt on Washington Race
                  Coarse.
               Takin it alltogether, I must say that my eggscurshin inter Prence George's County
                  diddent giv me a faverabul impresshin of the trooth and lyalty of the peeple of
                  that regin.
               In fack, ef ennyboddy in the North sposes that enny argyment short of hard nocks
                  and short commons will indooce our waywurd bruthers in the South to frayternize
                  with us, he must be a purson whoom it would be a foolsom complement to call a
                  foo-foo.
               Hopin that we may sun suckseed in convincin em of thar misstake by setch mild
                  perswashins, I remane,

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, May 7, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               As you will hear no more of the tearabil serees of runcounters on the
                  Rapperhammock, afore this reaches you then ennyboddy here doos now, I shall not
                  attemp in the ushil stile of newspaper curryspondents to make matters clar to the
                  public witch I hev no means of seein throo myself. Insted of graffic deskripshins,
                  I refer you to the tellagraffic statements. At best I could oney giv you the heads
                  of the noose, and by Saturday you will hev details.
               
               All day yestday I was sirkilatin among a number of wownded cumpany ofsirs and
                  rebel prisners, sent in from our lines, and endevorin from thar conflicktin
                  ackounts to form sum idee of the conflick. But it was onpossabul. Our own tellers
                  unannymusly disagreed in thar stories and the rebels dident agree with, enny of
                  em. The fact is that suppleturn offsirs nose very littel of the ginral moovements
                  of a fight. They air too apt to dror thar inferences from wot occurs within thar
                  own feeld of observashin, and the premises bein narrer the conclushins is
                  laterally wide of the mark. Consekently wile a wownded captin belongin to the
                  force witch bed ockapied the ridges at Fredericksburg was sartain that we heed
                  nockt Ginral Lee inter a cockt hat, a leftenant from the right wing was of a
                  pinion that Ginral Hooker bed ben kickt higher'n a kite. Howsever as the leftenant
                  was a shiftless Dutchman from Ginral Shirtz divishin, and bed a bullet hole in the
                  sole of his foot, I let him run on without payin much attenshin to his
                  gabble-merely remarkin that as he appeered to hev ben in a bad persishin for seein
                  wot was goin on in frunt, I should prefer waitin for Ginral Slowcum's report. He
                  warnt awar I spose that I bed alreddy heerd of the grand stampede of the Dutch
                  under Shirtz, a feet as will proove to all cummin ages that altho clumsy to look
                  at, thar is wunderful fleetness in the German Race. A wownded offsir of Best's
                  Artillery, who arrove here this mornin, ses he never seen the crack runners of the
                  Turn Veerin make setch time as all hans did arter Stunwall's Jackson's gang gin
                  thar battel yell and made thar rush. "Ive heern tell," ses he darfin in spite of
                  his wownd, "of the Flyin Dutchman of the Sea, but seven thousand flyin Dutchmen on
                  the land, with a volley of musketry plumpen inter thar starns, is a mutch sublimer
                  specktickle." By all ackounts, ef they hedn't ben brort up all standin by the
                  bagnets of Sykeses Reglars, they would hev kept on to the day of thar deth, like
                  thar sellybrated kentryman with the clockwurk leg.
               As to the rebel prisoners, thar ginral asspeck is skallywaggish, and sum of em
                  smells like old cannon swobs, in consekens of hevin ben primed with a mens
                  kwantities of rum and gunpowder prevus to goin inter ackshin. In coarse the
                  reackshin is tremenjus, now the effecks of the steamin is goin off, and not a few
                  of em is in a condishin borderin on wot the doctors call many a pot you. Thar
                  wardrubs air mostly light and well adopted to porpuses of ventilashin; and judgin
                  from thar thredbar apperience, you would say setch men must sun be worsted. But
                  thar frames air well knit and wiry, and they hev a rattlesnaky snaky eggspreshin
                  about the eyes that is by no means engagin. As to fitin, most of em is born with a
                  nateral taste for it, wile with us Nutherners it is ackwired. Howsever, kwite a
                  number of those I hev converst with complains of the shortness of grub in the
                  rebel ranks, and seems ankshus for a speedy piece. "At first," ses wun of em to
                  me, yestday, "I thort it was a jam up thing to be a sojer; but toting a muskit on
                  an emty stummick is alarmin hard work, Il be gaul darned ef it isent!" Anuther
                  told me he bed "drord no pay for leven munths, and ben down with the billus
                  remittance besides, and he wisht he mought go ded if he dident think it was bout
                  time for both sides to stop butting and gouging, and rest on thar lorils." Several
                  that I torked to declard they hed no desire to be "traded off for Yankees," but
                  would rayther stay here and take the oath of a legions than be sent back to the
                  Secesh army.
               The Secesh simperthisers here is in an agerny about Ginral Lee's extree-hazardus
                  persishin, and the presents of two thousand five hunderd captivated rebels in the
                  city, with four or five thousand more to foller, sours the milk of human kindness
                  in thar coco nuts considabul. But they think it best to cork up the vials of thar
                  rath, and let consealment like a wurm in the bud pray on thar dammask cheeks, for
                  fear they should sheer the fait of Villaindigham, who, in consekens of shoin his
                  hand in Ohio, hes put his foot in it.
               The noose in town to-day is that the Monitors is preparin wunst more to enter the
                  narrer channil ef the Edisto and giv the Charlestun forts another broadside. I
                  gess taint so. Giddyun Wells is a man that may as a ginral thing be depended on
                  for doin jest what he oughtent, when he oughtent, in the way it
                     oughtent to be dun, but Ime not prepard to bleve that his embesillyty
                  will carry him far enuff to poke his finger a seckind time inter the fire afore
                  the blisters of the first skorchin hes fairly heeld. But wot a pity it is we
                  should hev setch a Giddy Goose at the head of a Department whar the cunnin and
                  forecast of the Fox should be the guvernin principal.
               My indummytable friend, the President, presarves his ushil trankwil asspeck. He
                  seems to reelize the responsabilities that attach to the Eggseggative cheer, and
                  rises with the ockashin. As it is now mail-time I must foiler his illustrus

                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Bad warnt it? Jest as we was beginnin to holler Victry, and hed got to the eend of
                  the first sellabul, to hev to change the wurd inter victimized! The
                  rout to the Capital of the Slave States peers to be rayther harder to travil than
                  the road to the sorces of the Niger, witch I remember readin about when a
                  youngstir, in Mungo Park. Hooker's dash, howsever, is sartainly an improovement on
                  the Burnside smash, tho the result of the fray is percisely the same, and was
                  announst by eye-witnesses in the same frayseology, namely "Our Army hes recrost
                  the river in saifty." It is satisfactory to no that our survivin collumes hes
                  returnt saift. The return of killed and wownded is onavoidably postponed, for the
                  present, in consekens of thar bein left on the right bank of the Rapperhammock,
                  reposin on the bed of glory. That collume, when it cums to be footed up, will be a
                  hevvy wun Ime afeard.
               The most cumfurtin fetor of the bluddy affair is the large number of rebels slain.
                  Bein more'n hafe slewed with rum and gunpowder, they rusht blindly on thar doom
                  and was tumbled over in heeps by our staggerin showers of grape. The sum totil as
                  bit the dust is onknown, as it warnt conveenyent to stay long enuffon the ground
                  to count em up; but when our army goes back to finish up the job, that dooty will
                  be performt, and the fishal ackount publisht. As to prisners we hev stacks of em,
                  and capterd rebel flags is so plenty in the market that they may be called a drug
                  rayther than a standard airtickle.
               The reports from the Theayter of War clash so orfully, that it is difficult for
                  enny wun not behind the seens to assertain the origin of our discomforter. Sum ses
                  it was the wether. Uther sum allows we sheuld hey hed to back down wether or no.
                  Distingwisht milentary men thinks the enemee outflankt us; sum thinks they
                  outspankt us. Who nose? Wun thing is shoor. The story of thar flite from the line
                  of the Rapperhammock, was a flite of fancy. In coarse you hey red Fitin Joes
                  flamming address, congratalatin our army on its defeet. Ginral Lees manyfester
                  claimin a complete sucksess is in a simildar vain. As far as Bunkum is consarned
                  it is about a tie atwixt em, but our Ginral is on the rong side of the river,
                  witch is a serus drawhack.
               Onder the suckemstances, it's wunderful consolin to refleck that Stunman inflicted
                  a stunner on the rebs by cuttin thar railroads when they hed no more sojers in
                  Richmound to send over em. Also we oughter to be thankful to no that ef Hooker hed
                  larnt that important fack in time, he would hev "delivered battle" with his hull
                  army, in place of deliverin the army itself, with immedient despatch, on the North
                  bank of the Rapperhammock. It is likewise a proud thort that the sight of our
                  troopers throo sevral old wimmin in the secesh Capital inter sreekin hisstearicks,
                  and set the fashinabul belles to ringinthar hands, and the church-bells to ringin
                  thar clappers, creatin a universal perricksism of oncontrollabul emoshin. The
                  onhappy females eggspected the ushil outrages, and nuthin shorter; but to the
                  honor of our sojery be it sed, they merely flourished thar weepins in full vew of
                  the city, and then rode on, disdainin to use em on nun-cumbertents.
               Wot the necks dodge will be the latest noose from head-kwarters doosent indickate.
                  It mebbe backards, or forrards, or tryangler from Eely's Ford, or parrybolical or
                  parrydoxical—the last menshind bein upon the hull the most probably. Mutch depends
                  upon the struttygests of the War Department. The late trip over the Rapperhammock
                  and the Rapid Ann, is sed to hev ben figgerd out in that interestin branch of the
                  public servis, and I onderstand it is oney the first moove of a serious destined
                  to giv the Confedrates setch shocks in the feeld as will compel em to acknolledge
                  the corn afore harvest time cums round. The ridgnater of the skeem is the smooth
                  and polisht Ginral Halleck, and it is wisperd that he will assoom the cummand of
                  the Army of the Potomac and carry the diegram out in purson. The vetran offsirs,
                  in the feeld air kwite agreeable, for as he frekwently hauls them over the coals,
                  they think it no more'n right that he should hev a chanst to take a hand at
                  manooverin onder fire hisself. I dessay he will do wunders, for he hes hed the
                  advantidge of a West Pint eddicashin tho onfortnitly he dident carry his pint in
                  the West. Ef thar is enny bridging to be dun he will be sartain to hev the
                  pontoons on the spot by the time the enemee is prepard to receeve em.
               You will notis that thar is a triflin disagreement atwixt the bellygerents, in
                  relashin to the rebel loss in the late shindy. Hooker ses eighteen thousand; Lee ses seventeen
                  hundred. The trooth is sposed to lie sumwhars atween the two, but noboddy eggsept
                  the Recordin Angel ken tell percisely whar, and he's ben kep so etarnal bizzy
                  lately that its ten to wun ef his books is posted up. Thars no dout, howsever,
                  that we bagged four or five thousand of thar rank and file, and tharfore Lee's
                  statement must be as rank a fib as ever was put on file by a Ginral ankshus to
                  make the best of an aukard skrape.
               Stunwall Jackson's deth will be a bad thing for the rebels, as his energetick
                  sperrit was the life and soul of the corpse to witch he belonged. They could
                  better hev spard forty ridgements of thar ornary butternuts, Kernils and all, then
                  that crack namesake of Old Hickory's. Thar's not an offsir hafe as kwick on the
                  trigger left in the Cornfecdrit Army. His charge on Shirtz divishin was a suprisin
                  feet. It beat the Dutch. Thar never lived a braver sojer than Stunwall, and I gess
                  he thort he was right, tho in coarse he found out that he was in the rong box as
                  sun as he had kickt the bucket. The Richmound Inkwirer ses he was shot by his own
                  men, who misstook him for a mudsill. Setch axdents will happen in the best
                  reglated milentary fammalees. It is ginally bleved that Kernil Miles, of Bull Run
                  and Harper's Ferry sellebraty, was plugged by a Union sojer, who took him for a
                  traitor. Prehaps the sojer was right. Menny thinks so.
               Congratalashins bein the Order of the Day, I congratalate the kentry on the fack
                  that Grant holds the door to Vicksburg. Lord grant that he may walk in! But Ime
                  afeard thar'll hev to be considabul knockin dun afore the chaps as hangs onto the
                  door on tuther side lets go thar holt. Vicksburg is of a thunderin sight more
                  importence to us then Richmound, bekase ef we git the Mussysippi, the rebels can
                  eggsport no more supplies from Texas and Western Louseanna to the uther Suthern
                  States, and a state of starvashin will ensoo.
               We don't get mutch intelligens from Murphy's Burrow, but as Mr. Adams, in anser to
                  Lord Russell's cumplaints about enlisten Brittish subjects, ses the emigrants from
                  Ireland is bound for the West, I persoom Rosincranch is awaitin re-inforcements
                  from the Emrald Ile.
               Washington is tolably helthy, altho a good menny visiters is sufferin severely
                  from Tape Worm, a lingerin disease which is prevalent here at all seesins of the
                  year. The Modern Father of his Kentry and his Constitooshinal advisers is
                  salubrus, and unites with me in remainin,

                     have been expected from so staunch an advocate of Constitutional Liberty. He is

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, May 21, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               The Constitooshinal Advisers is far from eesy in thar minds, and the great
                  Springfieldian who holds the rains of pour is a leetle afeard that he hes gone
                  beyant the pail of his orthority in heving Villaindigham jugged. Noboddy keers a
                  red for Villaindighan, for it's well onderstood that he's a mere gas-bag; but it's
                  the idee of overridin the Constitushin and acts of Congress with SOJER LAW that
                  riles the public temper—it's the BAGONET that sticks in the gullets of the Peepul.
                  Sum of the most airnest members of the Republican Party is as mutch agen milentary
                  sezers in the free States as Guvner Seemore is, and wun of the most uncumpromissin
                  Unionists in Washington told me, this very mornin, that he thort the SWOORD was
                  makin altogether too free with the STATOOTS. The Nayshinal Intelligensir has
                  prooved beyant all kwestin that the perseedins in Ohio was in flagrant vilashin of
                  an eggspress act of the last sesshin; and I don't spose thar is twenty jernils in
                  the Union that'll jestify the grave afence. We hev noose here to-day that the
                  Press of New York, without distinkshin of party, hes agreed to take up the cudgels
                  agen supersedin legal processes with MUSKET LOR in the Paytryotic North, and
                  onless the Administrashin drors in its horns on this pint, the Cabnet will purty
                  sun hev the noosepapers in thar bar, and thar'll be hot wurk in the wigwarm.
               Ime inklined to bleve that the saygashus statesman onto whoos sholders the mantel
                  of Washington hes drifted, begins to feel like Richloo, in the play, when he found
                  the Weepin of Desputism rayther too hevvy for a weak old man to fence with; and
                  hens he hes detarmined to let the Ohio Humbug up and send him to make out his case
                  in Dixie, insted of boxing him up in a
                  Barsteel. But arter all, this is oney a hafe way meshur, and the ginral pinion
                  amung thortfull men in this regin is, that onless the right of their Guverment to
                  makre its charges agin citysins of the lyal States with cold steel in the place of
                  paper instrooments, and to try them by drum-head court-marshils insted of leevin
                  them to letherhed jewries, is disavowed in the plainest terms, thar will be an
                  all-thunderin row wun of these days.
               Belevin that sartatin parties who hed the ear of the President was endevorin to
                  pull the wool over his eyes in relashin to public sentiment on this ticklish
                  subjick, I called at the White House on Toosday and hed a long palaver with him.
                  As no "ginral order" agin the publickashin of the conversashin hes ben issood by
                  the Cheef Maunderin of the War Department, I venter to send you a diejest of the
                  dielog. The President was remarkably curshus and condesendin.
               "D. V.," ses he when I entered the sanktum, "I bleve its now seven weeks senst you
                  honnerd me with at call."
               "Six, benine Ruler," I replide, correctin his misstake.
               "I hev stept in," ses I, "in my sufferin capassity as wun of the peepul, to ax you
                  to put a stop to millenary arrests of civil individuals, in States whar the civil
                  lor hes not ben suspended. If you don't you'll put your foot in it."
               "Sir!" he retorted, with an impeeryal jester of his right hand, while he pulled
                  his whisker with the left, "you air too free."
               "No Abraham," I rejoined with kwiet dignity, "I am not free enuff,
                  when my libty is at the marcy of enny Ginral as chooses to trampel on the lors of
                  the land."
               "But," ses he, "you peered to rejice over the downfall of Villaindigham."
               He tort he had me thar.
               "Yes," I anserd, "that's troo, for I sposed at first he had ben took onder the act
                  of the last seshin of Congress, and would hev a legal trial afore a civil
                  tryboonal. But it seems he was seized, tried and condemnd by Sojer Lor alone, in
                  defians of the statoot. Thaars nuthin wus'n that dun in Rooshee or Austree."
               "What air you drivin at? Do I look like a man capabil of establishin and
                  maintainin a milentary desputism?" ses he, takin a stick of sweet flag outer his
                  pocket, and bitin off the eend of it. "Not at all, my mild and much beluved
                  frend," I responded, "ef ever thar was a coco nut full of the milk of human
                  kindness it is yourn. But 'Evil commoonicashins corrupt good manners.' Your amabul
                  weakness and vassalatin dispersishin, is took advantage of by desinin
                  demmygogs."
               "Oney to think," ses he, puttin his handkercher to his eyes, "that my pollytickle
                  enemees should endevor to raze a storm about my ears by representing that I want
                  to redooce my kentrymen to the condishin of surfs."
               "Wall," I observed kindly, "I don't think that of you; and ef you want the hull
                  North to entertain the same felines tords you as I do, jest dismiss wun member of
                  your Cabnet, and issoo a Proclamashin announcing that the SWOORD POWER is no
                  longer to be allowed to throttle down free speech in the LAND OF THE FREE."
               He sithed deeply, and muttered sumthin about callin a Cabnet Counsil, and dooin
                  all he could to satisfy the peepul; but alas! wots the use of good intenshins
                  without a stiff morril backbone.
               I think, howsever, that the change in Villaindigham's duynashin
                  is doo to my representashins; but I don't ask enny thanks from that pollytickle
                  chunk-head or his snake-in-the-grass assoshits. The Administrashin is a darned
                  sight better frend to the Ohio foo-foo than I am, for it is dooin its best to make
                  nateral insignificance conspickuous, by outragin a great prenceple for the sake of
                  chokin him down.
               All is as quiet as a churchyard on the Rapperhammock, and likely to be. Thar's
                  about as mutch chanst of Hooker re-crossin that interestin streemn at present, as
                  thar is of Stunwall Jackson's goste cumming back to giv us anuther bastin, from
                  tuther side of Jordin.
               Hopin for the best, but not expectin it very confidently, I remain, for Law,
                  Liberty, and the Union,

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, May 27, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               "I wunder ef Vickrsburg is took?" is the prevalin fizzyonomical eggspreshin in
                  Washington to-day. Ever senst we hed the noose that the enemee hed retreted from
                  the Big Black, a neger desire to no the final issoo hes ben manyfestedl here. A
                  Cabnet meetin was held this forenoon, to disgust the pros and
                     cons of the subjeck, at which my frend, the President, devoted
                  hisself to the cons, as ushil. I hev larnt sum of the particklers of
                  wot occurd at the meetin, throo a privit channil as commoonicates with the back
                  stars of the Counsel Chamber, and I bleve the follerlin draymatic sketch of the
                  percedins is as near the trooth as the fasillyties afforded by an ornery keyhole
                  will permit.
               Seen.—A rum in the War OffiS.
               Carrickters present.—Messers. A. Lincoln, W. H. Seward, E. Stanton, G. Welles,
                  and S. P. Chase.
               A. L. (risin and openin the palaver).—"Feller-Citysins and Constitooshinal
                  Advisers, bein in a state of suspense on ackount of the suspension of intelligents
                  from the Sown-west, witch you will agree with me is a great boar, I hev summount
                  you for the porpus of gettin your enlightend v ws, of the situashin at Vicksburg,
                  about witch I am sorry to say we air all ekwilly in the dark."
               W. H. S.—"Mr. President, my opinyun is that an onrepressabul conflick is now goin
                  on between Grant and Porter on the wun hand, and Pemberton and Johnston on the
                  uther hand, and regardin the distant strugrgel with the cam and thortfull eye of a
                  statesman and filossafer, I deem it premactoor to predick the issoo ontil I see
                  the offshal report of the result. The bitterest thing a man ken swaller is his own
                  wurds, and hevin tasted that kinder diet more'n wunst, I dekline venterin on enny
                  foregon conclushins for the futur. I ken oney say, that as a relijus man, with a
                  firm reliance on Providence, I hope my kentry will allus find a Helper in evry
                  Crisis."
               E. S. (sourcaustically)—"I respeck the Honabul gentman's diplomatick cawshin,
                  witch we air all awar is the frutes of sad and solemn experience, but as Cannon
                  Lor is esier to onderstand then Internayshinal Lor, Ime willin to bet him the
                  price of a milentary substitoot agin his chance for the Presidenshil Cheer, that
                  Vickrsburg is ourn at this moment."
               A. L. (with that remarkabul wink of his). "Bet him William Henry, my boy; you cant
                  loose nuthin, no how!"
               G. W. (Rip-van-winkellishly).—"I doo spose, now, we shall bag em. Porter's post,
                  now, it appeers to me, decidedly puts wots-his-name in the rong box; and as our
                  files envelop him on the either side and Johnston hes probly mistaken the
                  direckshin, it doos seem to me now, espeshelly senst that carryer was taken with
                  the rebel despatches, that if Furygut, in the Hartford sticks to the letter of
                  his—"
               A. L. (mildly interruptin).—Giddyun, Giddyun, shetup. As a postmaster you adorned
                  your modest stashin, but in setch matters as mastering fortified posts you air not
                  well posted, Welles. Its a pity upon the hull, that you was ever taken outer the
                  postoffis, and put inter anuther post, whar I am afeard you will allus be a ded
                  letter."
               [Here I must brake inter the dielog for a minit, jest to say that I entirely
                  goinside with the abuv astoot observashin, and that the suverin people also
                  goinsides, and that we all wish the venabul old gentman with the top-not would see
                  it in that light.]
               G. W. (seemingly onconshus of the President's remarks].—Yes, as I was sayin, ef my
                  instruckshins is carrid out, the stronghold of the rebels will be took, and thar
                  bullyin purty effectuallly put down."
               S. P. C. (suddently lookin tip from the last page of hafe a kwire of paper on
                  witch he hed ben calkilatin the compound interest on ten thousand millyuns of
                  greenbacks for two hunderd years).—"Bulliun is down, Sir; it fell
                  over six per cent in wun day."
               A. L. (impayshently).—"Let us cum to the pint. The kwestin afore the meetin is
                  this—'Is the mayjority of us in favor of blevin that the flag of the free flotes
                  over the Sebasterpull of the Mussysippi? Salmon P. will please put it to the vote,
                  and giv us the net prosseeds."
               S. P. C.—(arter collectin the sentimens of the Counsil)—"Ed., Gid. and me votes in
                  the firmative, Abe in the niggertive, and William H. both ways, and wishes both
                  opinyuns to be sot down in blacks and white, for futur reference. The Kwestin is
                  carrid."
               A. L.—"Yes, but Ime afeard Vickburg aint. Howsever, Grant is sartainly the right
                  sort of a boy to push on the colume, and it may be that for wunst; the Rooler of
                  Mankind has caused our lines to fall in present places. Ef on the contrary the
                  rebels hes ben too mutch for us, we ken oney say, with the poick, 'thar is a
                  Providence that shapes thar eends, ruff hew em how we will.' And now, the publick
                  bizness hevin ben put throo, lets hev a little hulsum privit recreashin. Gid, why
                  is conkerin Vicksburg by bumbardment like fryin slapjacks?"
               
               G. W. (with a sleepy smild).—"Is it bekase its dun brown?"
               A. L.—"No, you old hoss-mareen; its bekase its a batter-y
                  bizness."
               The Entire Awedience.—"Ha! ha!" "Ho! ho!" "He! he!" "Hi! hi! hi!"
               A. L. (resumin).—"My jolly frends, why is your larfter like a dispatch announcing
                  the captor of rebel prisners?"
               E. S.—"Rayther too eggstravagant to be genwine—is that it?"
               A. L. (dookin riled).—"Bah! you old Bellona saucedge. Cant you see its bekase its
                  a catchy-nater-y report."
               (Anuther intermisshin for risable refreshment).
               A. L. (resumin agin).—Wot game of skill doos the proposed Cornskripshin
                  resemble?"
               W. H. S.—Dubble Shuffle, mebbe."
               S. P. C.—I call it the sortin of the pack previous to a game at
                     Water-loo—onlimited."
               A. L.—"Purty good for you, Old Five-Twenties, but thats not the troo solushih of
                  the problem. The game witch the Cornskripshin most resembles, is the game of
                     drafts; and my objeck is to play it accordin to the old rool, and
                  force the back men out as kwick as possabul."
               [Applause by the Cabnet, who rise from thar cheers, shake hands with the
                  President, and exhunt omnibuss]
               Thar, you and the public hev it as I hed it; and hopin evryboddy will appreshiate
                  the mixter of wit and wisdom with witch affairs of State air disgust by the

                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Wunst more the oncommon smartness of the man called by Providence, throo the
                  Ballet Box, to rool over the most enlightened ened nayshin out, hes ben made
                  palpabul to the meanest comprehensin. I informt you in my last that he stud alone
                  amidst the assembeld wisdunm of his Cabnet, with reports of the capter of
                  Vicksburg thunderin in his ears, and eggsprest the bleef that it had not been
                  captivated. He prayed that it mought hey ben, but he was shoor it hedent; and
                  Hevin, ankshus to oblige the kentry with a noo pruff of his penetrashin, thort it
                  best to disregaird his prayers in order to vindicate his judgment. Bein onwilling
                  to place Hevin in setch an embarrassin predickyment a seckind time, he preposes to
                  remain abeslootly non-commital dooring the remainder of the sege. I hey axed him
                  repetidly within the last few days wot he sposed would be the isoo, and his
                  uniform anser hes ben "I look for the best that ken possably happen, and also for
                  the wurst that ken possably occur, and shell cherfully ackquiess in either." He
                  hes given the same reply I understand to all inkwirin frends, and may now be sed,
                  figgeratively speakin, to be standin nooter afore the peepul, with his eyes shet
                  and his mouth opin, waitin for wot Providence may send him. From the present
                  asspeck of affairs he will probly hev to remain in that attitood for sum time
                  afore ennything draps.
               Yestday thar was a report in town that Ginral Pemberton was hung, but on tracin it
                  to the War Offis I found it arose from the mistake of a clerk as dident no the
                  ropes, who hed red in a Richmound paper that he was sed to hev ben suspended. The
                  noose was too good to be troo. Auger, I notis, hes given the rebels a round turn
                  at Port Hudson, and the prospect of his speedily puttin the screws to that
                  important post air, upon the hull, encurridging. Ginral Sexton hes jest ben on
                  from Port Ryal, and he intermated, I orderstand, that Hunter and the Cummander at
                  Newbern hes berrid the hatchet and smoked the calamus, like Foster-bruthers.
                  Gammon! Hunter, in coarse, hes the warm sport of Chase, but he's bound to be
                  releaved, witch will be a great releaf to Foster, who luvs him rayther wurse than
                  Satan luvs Saint Peter.
               Ginral Sexton speaks highly of the condishin of our cullerd brethren in arms in
                  South Caroliny. He ses thar soles air in the cause, and if they git a chanst at
                  thar late masters, the wool will be apt to fly. As a body he considers them ekwil
                  to enny race in the wurld; and feels sartain that all the charges made agin em
                  will be rebutted in thar first collushin with the enemee. I don't see myself why
                  they should be more afeard to risk thar carcasses than us Carcassians; and as they
                  hev ben Cuffed all thar lives, its oney
                  human natur for em to Cuff back, now thar's a fair openin.
               On the banks of the Rapperhammock, a deth-like kwiet prevales. Sum sposes as
                  Ginral Hooker is ritin a full report of the Union cashualities in the late
                  splurge, and doosent want to be annoyed and put out. Bein a slow penman it may
                  prehaps take him ontil the middle of July to get throo, and then ef the wether is
                  considerd warm enuff he may possably wunst more open fire upon the enemee. In the
                  intrim the Army of the Potomac picknicks in peace in the midst of the most
                  pickteresk senery, and is serenaded evry night by hunderds of birds of the
                  whip-her-well speeches, who air thort by sum of the sojers to be the sperrits of
                  thar ded comraids, disguysed in fethers, offerin a frendly subjestin as to what
                  oughter be dun to evry wayward sister of the Sutherin Cornfedracy.
               Torkin of sperrits, hev you heerd that sartain members of the Cabnet, as hev
                  desarvedly lost all confidens in tharselves, hes commenst consultin the sperrits
                  of just men made perfeck. They doo say as meetins hey been held at the White House
                  at witch the presense of sum distingwisht members of the underground frayternity
                  was respeckfully reckwested, in order to obtain thar vews on the conduct of the
                  war. Ef flyin rummers is to be bleved, several deceast worriers sent wurd by the
                  subtrainyan tellagraft that they considerd the kentry goin to the dogs. Ginral
                  Jackson is reported to hev rapt out his opinyun on the hed of the Seckatry of War
                  in the most emfatic terms to be found in the ded langwidges. Seckatry Welles is
                  also stated to have ben sarved in the same way by the gostes of Perry and Decatur.
                  I don't like to repeat the eggspreshins sed to hey ben addrest to the Seckatries
                  by the departed heroes, bekase I event mutch faith in the story; but ef they did
                  make the remarks attribitted to em, I honor thar judgment and respeck thar
                  candor.
               The minds of the Constitooshinal Advisers is considabully eggsersised jest now
                  about the Cornskripshin. To borrer a metafor, from a high sorce, witch you may hev
                  possibly met afore in the noosepapeers, every thing is reddy to "run the masheen";
                  but it is thort that it mought run eesier ef the wheels was greazed witch a leetle
                  of the ile of victory. As sun as the Gibberalter of the Mussysippi is took, the
                  President will call for three or four hunderd thousand men to finish up the war,
                  and it is hoped the draft will be cherfully honered. "Oney let us open the river,"
                  ses Stanton, "and thar'll be no difficulty about gettin the peeple to fall in."
                  And Halleck allows that when setch is the case, evryboddy abul to bare arms will
                  be willin to roll up thar shirt sleeves and do thar purtyest. On the uther hand,
                  ef Grant should go to pot the masses wont be kwite so eger to be musterd. The
                  plain trooth is—and its well onderstood here—that we've cum to the turnin pint of
                  the great shindy. Queer noshins will occur to the best regulated fammalies, and
                  sumhow a large number of the suns of Columby hes got it inter thar obstinit heds
                  that ******* (you can gess at the name by the number of stars) nose rayther less
                  about plannin campains than the Man in the Moon nose about the state of publick
                  morrills in the planit Venus. Its a deplorabul thing that an idee of this nater
                  should hev sezed upon the poplar mind; but the peeple hes ben so frekwently
                  disappinted in consekens of leanin on brokin reeds, that wun ken hardly blame em
                  of they pine for a seckind edishin of Old Hickory.
               The wether here is tolabul warm, and the kitchen gardins is fill of airly

                  peas and plenty.

                  [The Disbanded's lucubrations for this week are of a somewhat desultory
                     character. All sorts of rumors were afloat in Washington; and it is evident
                     that he had very little faith in any of them. It is pretty clear that the
                     Father of Fibs has a good deal to do with Union telegraph lines.—EDS.]
               
               
                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, June 10, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               "Vicksburg hes caved in." "Bet a V it haint." "Rebels confess it." "Gas and
                  gammon." "Sure's you liv." "Whar did the noose cum from?" "Murphy's Burrow." "Sum
                  small potater blower, I spose." "Perticklers in the Richmound papers." "That be
                  gaul-darned, now! shet up." "They hed to kullaps. Offsir's critters
                  all gon, hides and all. Dogs gin out Monday week; finisht the last o' the cats
                  Wensday follerin. Hed to srender or perish in the attemp. Consekently
                     didsrender der." "Who
                  ses so?" "Respectabul, lady from Shelbyville reports that the rebels acknolledge
                  the corn, and 'a purson' sor it in the rebel jernils." "Stockjobbin lie!" "Cork
                  up, you copperhead cuss!" "Here's the extree Republicken! Capter o'
                  Vicksburg!" "Hurrah! three cheers for Grant."
               Setch is about an averidge sample of the bar rum gabble in Washington this mornin,
                  and Ime afeard the dispatch from Murphy's Burrow is of the same nater—all
                  balderdash. We've hed bushels of idol stories from that pint, and Ide be eenamoost
                  willin to go baal that this is epochryfull like all the rest. Vicksburg is
                  compleatly infested, and is shoor to be ourn sunner or later—but Ime inklined to
                  think it will be later, and that the gratifyin informashin receved from "a lady"
                  and "a purson" is primatoor.
               Howsever, thars a report in town of a cavalry shindly nearder hum, witch must be
                  troo, bekase the wownded is arrivin at Alexandry, witch is a kinder bulletin that
                  speaks for itself. It seems that the rebel Ginral Stuart meditated a rush inter
                  Merryland and hed mustered his collumes of a salt in the neyborhood of
                  Crullpepper, hopin to cross the Potomac afore we could ketch up with him. It was a
                  spicy project, but Hooker put his finger in the dish and spylt it. Yestdtay,
                  Ginral Plesenton pitcht inter Stuart with cavalry, infantry, and artillery, on the
                  Rapperhammock, sumwhars near Sulfur Springs, and wuul of the wownded ses we gin
                  him ——, while uthers allow he gin us an ekwilly warm resepshin. The
                  Constitooshinal Adviser at the head of the War Department nose all about it, but
                  he ses nuthin, and as he is ushilly ready enuff to shoot with a lonmg bow when
                  thars the slitest ground to go upon, menny considders his silence aquiverlent to a
                  defeet. I hope its not so this time, tho when I axed him for the latest
                  awethentick informnashin, he sirveyed me contempshusly over the rims of his
                  spectickles, and sed he hed too mutch foursight to entrust importent farels to
                  mussenary skribblers. Onwillin to take offence whar, prehaps, nun was intended, I
                  shuck him corjally by the hand, and remarkin in a friendly way that he was a
                  "bully boy with a glass eye", or, ef he preferd the frays, "a big thing in
                  perryfocals". I started for the Navy Department, to pump the ruth outer Welles.
                  But accordin to that distingwisht marriner's invariabul custom, he knew nuthin. He
                  heddent even heerd that the Alabammer hed taken four more ships, and that Captin
                  Semmes hed rekwested the skippers to giv his complements to the Honoabul Rip Van
                  Winkel, at Washington. Thinkin to please and flatter the venabul man by a
                  naughtical illushin, I inkwired ef he was fond of boxin the windlass; to witlch he
                  replide, "very mutch so," and that when a boy nuthin sooted him better than to put
                  his capstan-bar inter the binnacle and help to heave the anker. As I was levin,
                  lie told me confidenshally that he eggspected to diskiver the longtitood in a day
                  or two. I persoom he ment the longtitood of the Alabammer, but I gess she's hed
                  too mutch latitood gin her to render setch an explite possabul.
               Senst the foregoin parrygraft was endited, I hed a short cornference with the head
                  of the nashin. He sed he hed a dispatch of the utmost moment from Vicksburg, witch
                  led him to bleve that sumthin sirprisin (he laid an emfasis on the wurd sirprisin)
                  mought happin at enny minit; and that he was lookin for it from hour to hour. I
                  venterd to interrogate him as to the compleckshin of the noose he andizzypated,
                  upon witch he gin me a playfull poke in the rebs, and anserd that we would probly
                  "lick the enemee as ushil". I sed, "May it please your Eggsllency, thats nuther
                  here nor thar; kant you be more definit?"
               "Wots the kweery?" he responded.
               "Is the Mollycoff" of the Mussysippy doomed?" I asked.
               "Thats accordin as it falls" he replide.
               At this pint he shet down onto me, and I could git no further satisfackshin on the
                  subjeck. About the affairs atwixt Plesenton and Stuart he was more commoonicativ.
                  He showed me, sum dispatches he hed jest received, and, on readin em, I sed, "Its
                  a brilyant victry on our side ef these ackounts air troo, and they may be
                  air."
               "May be air," he sithed, repeatin my wurds like an eccho. I dunno as he ment
                  ennything, tho he hes ben deseved so offenn that I shouldent wundler ef he
                  intended it as a joak—wun of his solem 'ums.
               But Ime oney wastin time, and forgetting that afore this meets the publick gays
                  the Nell of Vicksburg may hev ben rung and the Rapperhammock clard of the islent
                  fo. So be it; for ef we dont make amens for lost time purty sun, evrybody'll begin
                  to think the Union's past prayin for.
               It peers from the tellagrams and cetery from Louseanna and South Caroliny that our
                  cullerd brethrrin in arms is makin a purty strong fight out thar. No dout they go
                  inter the confick with thar feelins strung up to the hyst pitch, bein well awar
                  that ef capterd they will swing from the neardest trees, in cunformity with a
                  neckspress, order to that effect from Jeff Davis. But its nuthin to us wot promps
                  thar deeds of curridge, s'long as they
                  go in like bull-dogs. Black worriers ansers the porpus jest as well as white; in
                  fack, thar was wunst a black prence of Wales as gn the French and Germanas a most
                  onlorful whalin. So, honor to the cullerd brave! Render onto Sezer the things that
                  air Sezer's, and to Pomp the things witch air Pomp's.
               Airnestly hopin that the same MERKARY as contains this letter will
                  set all douts about Vicksbug at rest, by announcin that all its re-douts is in our

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, June 18, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               We air preparin for a combat. Ginral Hindshellman cummands the milentary, and
                  Ginral Panic the civillains. Ginral Abraham Lincoln cummands hisself (witch is
                  more'n ken be sed of evryboddy here), and tharfore oughter cummand universal sport
                  and simperthy. He is a trump, and ekwill to the crysis. So am I. I dont think
                  Halleck is. Nor Stanton. Hooker may or he may not. Time will tell. What time I
                  cant say; but probly sum time atween this and Saterday night. We air on the eve of
                  great events, and shell be evry evening ontil further notis. Our defenses in frunt
                  is bein made stronger by wurkin parties of contrabans. But we are weak in the
                  rare, and thar, sum thinks, the rebels will endevor to plug us. Nuthin ken eggseed
                  the eggsightment of our kullerd brethren. You ken see it in the whites of their
                  eyes and thar ginral demeaner. Evry contraban is wedded to the Union eaws, and
                  will die in the last ditch ef Washington falls. So will myself and Mr. Lincoln. We
                  swore it in his sanktum to-day, with our hands on his admirabul treaties on
                  arbitrary arrests, witch hes ben printed in pamflit form and is as troo as
                  Gosapel. Thar is a ditch near Bladensburg that will jest fit us. It is seven foot
                  long by eight inches acrost, and as purty a bed of glory as ever you seen. Stanton
                  kant cum in—it isent wide enuff. In this emerginsea the President feels whoos his
                  frend. We will sink or swim together. Ef ennything happens, speak of us as we
                  deserve. Nuthin exterminate nor 0 set down in mallis. Say
                  Orestus sleeps with his Pieladies; Demon with his Pithyass. And so no msore! These
                  is my last instruckshins ef Washington falls. We will never be capterd alive. Ef
                  it comes to that we shall fall on our swoords. I hed a very hansum silver-handeld
                  wun presented to me at Harrassin Landlin, with a neat speetch, by the Duck de
                  Chatters. The President will use it first, on ackount of pryority of rank, and I
                  shell compleat the sacrifiz. But Washington wont fall. It will see Ginral Lee
                  darned first. Ef I was an enshoorance kumpany Ide enshoor it for sevral per cent
                  onder the extree hazardous premium. We air fortifyin Rock Crick, and air about to
                  cut a canawl throo Gorgetown Heights, in order to unite it with the Potomac and
                  bring the gunboats round inter the slashes. Slygo Crick and the Norwest, two
                  streams remarbal for catfish and lampree eels (of witch Ginral Longstreet is sed
                  to be be very fond), is also bein put in a good state of defens, and the
                  broomsedge on the plantashins in Prence Georges bounty is to be lined with
                  sharpshooters. The Tiber is also to be dug out to the dept of thirty fathums, so
                  as to allow ship's of the line to lie at anchor there and purteck the market.
                  Finerly both wings of the capitol is to be pearst for flyin Artillery, and a
                  Dollgrin fifteen-inch smooth-bore mounted on the top of the central doom. In
                  short, nuthin will be left undun to render the city impregnant, and the women will
                  all be sent to a place of saifty as a precawshin agin the wurst. It takes
                  considabul time to tell all this, but it will be accomplisht by our accomplisht
                  milentary orthorities in less'n six weeks.
               In the meantime tellagratft despatches of the most alarmin carrickter is cummin in
                  insessantly from all pints of the cumpiss at wunst. From these we larn that Ginral
                  Lee bein detarmined to go the hull hog in the way of invashin, is en
                     root with a hunderd and fifty thousand men for Philadelfy—also, that
                  he is makin forced marches for Western Virginny—futhermore, that he is mlakin for
                  Manasses and Bull Run. He peers to be ubequitus, and his plan is sposed to be to
                  pitch inter us with the same troops from all kwarters at the same moment. He is a
                  wunderfull man, is this Lee—a kinder "litle joker" on a grand skale, and noboddy ken tell cept hisself and
                  Bellsbub onder witch thimble he will turn up. All that we ken say with sartainty
                  is that he's sumwhars, and that ef "Fightin Joe" and the rest of em is wuth shucks
                  he'll all-thunderin sun be nowhars.
               The present warabouts of the Nashins Hope, Ginral Hooker, I am forbidden to
                  disclose. He is not on the Rapperhammock, but I trust I vilate no confidens in
                  sayin that he's on the Alert. We larn here to-day that Ginral George B. Maclellin
                  hes left New York for Albany, witch is encurredgin. When Ginral G. B. M. changes
                  his base, sumthins shoor to happen. It did, you know, when he changed his base
                  from the White House. Sum thinks he eggspects to change his base to
                  the White House wun of these days. Mebbe! In the interim he is waiting on
                  Providence. Let him wait. If ever thar was a hero as knowed how to wait, he doos.
                  Whenever he was ordered to advance at dubbel-kwick, he allus waited for the
                  waggins. Wunst he waited three weeks. Ef he was a waiter at a hottel, thar
                  wouldent be much hurryin up the cakes at that shop, I gess.
               I dont pretend to know all the secrets of Abrahams buzzum; but I will say this for
                  our grayshus cheef—he keeps a stiff upper lip. Not a har in his whiskers kwivers,
                  and his pulse (I made an eggscuse to feel it yestday) beats precisely sixty-eight
                  and a hafe in a minit, railrode time. His brow is onruffled, his temper even. Ef
                  he hes enny new rinkels they air in his capayshus mind. I looked him strait in the
                  eye this mornin, and he axed me, in his ushil commick way, ef I obsarved ennything
                  green thar. I dident. On the contrary, it was full of fire. He thinks a good deal
                  of Stanton—bout as much as I do. Ditto of Halleck. Welles the same. He's very kind
                  to me—Heaven bless him. He ses I may say wot I like of him and his'n. By "his'n"
                  he means the Constitooshinal Advisers. Ime not to be subjeck to arbitary arrests
                  nor sent to Fort Laugheryet, nor made a present to Jeff Davis, nor utherwised
                  snubbed nor disannulled. I carry a mennyrandum to that effeck in my watch-pocket,
                  anuther of similider tenner pasted to the crown of my hat, and a third of a like
                  nater sowed to the back of my shirt, all signed "A. L. Respect this." Consekently
                  I am pursenally garanteed "freedom of speetch and of the Press". Would you like to
                  hev a dockyment or two of the same carrickter? Ef you would, jest say so, and Ile
                  get his His Eggsellency to scratch em off and send em on. They air useful in these
                  Villaindighammering times.
               All that Ive told you in this letter about army moovements will, of coarse, be
                  stale news by the time it reeches you, as a great battle may hev ben fit afore
                  then. It is important to know "the situashin" prevus to the impendin shindy. As to
                  "our situashin" arter it, enny thick-hedded tellagraft operator ken tell you
                  that.

                  [The following letter appears to us to lack in some degree the perspicuity and
                     precision which usually characterize the communications of the Disbanded; but
                     it must be remembered that it was penned in the midst of a chaos of reports,
                     and rumors, and surmises, well calculated to reduce the strongest mind to a
                     state of hopeless imbecility. It will be seen that our correspondent is
                     prevented, by a commendable regard for his word and for his country's cause,
                     from telling all he knows. In this respect he differs from most Washington
                     letter-writers, who make it a rule to tell more than they know, and whose sins
                     of commission, omission, and addition, accumulate without intermission. Where
                     they expert to go to when they die, it is not for us to say.—EDS.]
               
               
                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, June 24, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Lee and Ewill hes ben spotted at last; but they may hev changed thar spots afore
                  this reeches you, for they cumbine the eelasstisity of the flee with the suttelty
                  of the sarpint. At present they air in the Shunadoor Valley smokin thar pipes in
                  cumparative kwiet. They thretten to make Washington smoke shortly, but a relieble
                  contraban who hes jest cum in from Fort Tobacco ses this is a meer sham. Hill is
                  also in the Valley, and sed to be very much deprest. Lee on the other hand is
                  reported jolly, and boasts that he hes got the wether gage of Hooker. Time will
                  tell wether he hes or no.
               Our cavilry is doin things up brown. The rebel dragons air evrywhar flyin afore
                  em, and Stuart's posishin will sun be far from a plesant 'un. Buford hes gin the
                  rebels at Snigger's Gap caws for sorrer, Grigg hes druv the mane body of thar boss
                     merrily rily afore him more'n ten
                  milds, and another strong detachment of Secesh cavilry hes ben out-manovered in a
                  forridgin eggspedishin, by a moovement of Stall's. Ef our men was oney as, well
                  mounted as the enemee, they could ride over em. ruff-shod; but one-hafe of the
                  losses furinisht by the Guverment corntractors look as ef they hed jest cum outer
                  veteranarius horspitals, and is as weak in the knees as a peace-preachin
                  Unionist.
               Hafe an hour hes elapst senst I writ the abuv, and the tellagraft hes developt a
                  new fetor in the enemees plans, witch entirely changes the face of affares. Ginral
                  Skunk announces that insted of Ginral Ewill bein in the Shunadoor Valley, he hes
                  crost the Potomac at the hed of forty thousand men, and "gobbled" our forces in
                  the neybrood of Auntyeatem. Thars a slite oder of eggsagerashin about Skunk's
                  report, but it may be troo. Wot givs it an air of orthentissity, is the deshartnin
                  statement that the enemee is hard at work bildin bridges over the
                     canawl. This seems so nateral that everyboddy here is inclined to credit
                  the story. We all know that nuthin forms setch an empediment to the proggress of
                  an army as a canawl. Ef it hed ben a river now, like the Potomac, it would hev ben
                  different; but a canawl is always locked, and it is probabul that our sojers, when
                  they saw the horsteal fo approachin, immediently hid away the key to the
                  persishin. It was a thortful act of theirn, and cackelated to do good, as
                  Sinsinnatus reinarkt when he was told that a passel of geese hed yawped till they
                  alarmed the Capital. The ragin abiss will be crost I spose afore this reeches you,
                  and ef so I tremble for Pennsylvany and New Jarsey. Men capabul of bridgin a
                  canawl wont hesitate, I recken, to wade the Susquehannah and Delawar.
               But it's useless to speckilate when new convickshins flash on the bewilderd mind
                  evry moment. The wires is eenamuost red hot with contradickshins, and whether the
                  rebel army is in the State of Pennsilvany or not, it is kwite sartain that
                  evrybody here is in a state of muddle. Howsever, things will clarup mebbe, by the
                  eend of the week, and prehaps wot is confushin wus confounded now, may be made
                  perspickuous to the meanest intelleck in the next SUNDAY MERKARY.
               
               Hooker was here on Tuesday, and hed a long privit conversashin with the President.
                  By the kind permishin of the Father of his Kentry—who will please accept my thanks
                  for the favor, throo your widely serkilated collumes—I sot behind a skreen in the
                  sanktum and took notes. I send you the dialog jest as it occurd, 'cept whar his
                  Eggsellency droo his pen throo a passidge or two that he thort calkelated to giv
                  aid and cumfort to the Copperheds and Jeffites.
               A. L.—Well, Hooker, how's the Army of the Potomac? They've hed a lonng march. How
                  is thar poor feet ?"
               J. H.—Blistered sum; and a few is suffrin from coop de
                  soleheal.
               A. L. (kindly).—That's bad. Shell I tell Stanton to send on a few thousand gross
                  of silk umbrellers?
               J. H.—No, thank you. We may be hot-headed, but we don't reckwire parrysoles.
               A. L.—No offence, my brave friend. Hevin the welfare of the army at hart, its oney
                  nateral, you know, that I should wish it to keep shady.
               J. H.—Keep shady! We've ben keepin shady too long. We want to go right out inter
                  the open, and pitch inter the enemee wharever we ken find em.
               A. L.—But Washington must be defended, Hooker. Stanton ses so, and Halleck, and
                  likewise Welles. How menny live men hev you, all tolled?
               J. H.———thousand infantry,——thousand cavalry, and——batteries.
               A. L.—My Constitooshinal Advisers allows we want em all, and more too, to defend
                  Washington agen the ruthless invaders.
               J.—Doos your Eggsellency spose you ken "ockapy and possess" the rebel strongholts,
                  and carry out the Mancipayshin Act, by fendin off insted of goin in.
               A. L.—No, you thurrow-goin old fire-eater, I don't, and I confess Ime in favor of
                  vigrus meshurs myself, but Stanton and Halleck.
               J. H.—Sir, you air Commander-In-Chief. You ken cut the tether that keeps the
                  finest army on the planet flutterin around the capital like a hen tied to a
                  chicken-coop. Jest you pass the word to fowler up the fo, and we'll
                  giv Lee sumthin else to think of besides threttenin Bawtltomore and
                  Washington.
               A. L.—You're right—I feel you're right.
               D. V. (peepin over the skreen in oncontrollabul emoshin)—He is, Abraham! He is!
                  Foller the instinks of your own lofty intellect, and let the Constitooshinal
                  Advisers go—whar glory awaits em.
               A. L. (with mayjestick gravity).—Major-Ginral Hooker, receive from me your
                  instruckshins. You will start immediently for the Head Kwarters, of the Army of
                  the Potomac, and on atrrivin thar you will, et cetery, et cetery, et
                  cetery, et cetery
               
               [The foregoin et ceteries represents milentary direckshins of the
                  hyst importance, skratched out by the President for resins of state. Thar tenner
                  will be obvius to all mankind atween this and the Fourth. In the meantime, public
                  opinyun is reckwested to suspend itself.]
               J. H. (foldin up the instruckshins and puttin em in his hat). —Thanks, Mr.
                  President—-thanks. Depend upon old Joe Hooker.
               A. L. (dryly).—Sum of my frends ses Ime a good deal given to dependin on Old Joes,
                  Ginral (a larf from behind the skreen), and that puts me in mind of a story about
                  Jo King of Springfield. You see—
               J. H.—Eggscuse me, Mr. President. Ide be delighted to hear the little narrytiv,
                  but you know my motto—Bizness afore pleshure. Adoo! Adoo!
               And so the intervew eended.
               Let the public keep its eyes skinned. Within ten days thar'll be the most
                  tremenjus—but no, my lips is sealed, and I ken oney say, look out for hard whacks
                  shortly. Hopin that Hooker'll giv the rebel airthquakes, and confidently awaitin
                  the concussion, I remain, for self and Abraham,
               
                  Yours, allus,
                  A DISBANDED VOLUNTEER.
               
            
            
               No. CVII.
               
                  [We feel that we are only putting into words the heartfelt prayer of every
                     reader of the SUNDAY MERCURY, when we say, solemnly and

                     WASHINGTON, Tuesday Noon, June 30, 1863.
                     Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
                  
                  I rite airly this week, bekase I am goin out on a reckanuisance (desguysed as a
                     rebel to that degree that my own boss wont no me), and shell not be back from
                     the frunt for sum days. My misshin is strickly privit, and, by rekwest of the
                     President, I omit to state whar Ime bound, as he thinks it mought cumpromis mis
                     the saifty of his dearest and brayvest frend. I may state, howsever, without
                     vialatin instruckshins, that, in the wurds of Duglas in the play, it is my
                     objeck to "huvver about the enemee". Ef tuck up as a spy, I shell probly be
                     hung; ef not, I hop to elevate myself in the estimashin of my kentrymen. I
                     shell start in wun hour from the abuv date, and ef suckcessful, will send you
                     the minnits of my eggspedishin as sun as I return. I am allreddy a raid in
                     desguys, and will giv you sum idee of my secesh rig, witch I prechest
                     seckind-handed of a poor white trash that was brort in prisner this mornin. A
                     more seckind-handed soot hes seldum ben seen in civileyesd sosity. It consests
                     of a butter-nut coat cut down to a jacket by the thorn-bushes in the slashes,
                     and a pair of breaches to match; the hull bein satterated with all the juce
                     that the oner hed in him when he listed in the rebel sarvis. Also a slap-jack
                     hat, witch hes the aperience—and the aroamer currysponds—of hevin ben soked in
                     castor-ile for a cupple of years or so. Likewise a pair of ventilatin boots,
                     the soles of witch is tide to the uppers with ropeyarn legaments at the toes,
                     and in setch a wownded condishin at the opposit eends as to be past healin. In
                     this elegant costoom, with my pistils stuck in a belt, considder myself "the
                     yaller flower of the forrest." My idee is to be mistuck for a secesh gorilla,
                     on his way to Pennsylvany to plunder the Nuthern slop shops. It seems to me
                     that in setch duds as these the rebel offsirs will never mistrust that Ime not
                     wun of thar own vermin. The oridginal oner of the wardrub is a well nit man,
                     about my own bild. He hails from Louseanna, and I shell try to imitate his
                     dirty and sluvenly asspeck, and ef kwestined, shell swar that I was born and
                     brort up in that state. I dessay you will think it rayther a pokerish bizness
                     Ime goin on, but Ive saved my har in menny a wuss skrape. Ef Washington,
                     Bawltomore, and Philadelphy falls inter the hands of the Cornfedrits while Ime
                     on the skout, I intend to make my way to New York by way of Vicksburg. By that
                     time the Mollycoff of the Mussysippi will be ourn, and I ken bring Grant and
                     his army along, so as to take Lee on his west flank, and turn the tide of
                     victry in faver of the Army of the Potomac, and the lively, enterprisin,
                     prompt, and paytryotic citysins of the Keystone State.
                  The President, tho sumwot cast down, is in faver of a firm stand at the Seat of
                     Guverment. The Slashes is to be fortyfide, and the cavalry stashind as
                     look-outs on Georgetown Heights; men on hossback bein abel to see further than
                     a-foot, and high pints of land bein particklerly faverabul for the moovements
                        of redgements of boss. (See
                     "Camppains of the Duck of Marlburrow", and uther wurks.) Sharpshooters with
                     Minie rifuls are to be posted in the poplars of Pennsylvany avenoo, in the
                     manner reckommended by Joe Minie and uther poplar milentary riters. Stanton
                     will take charge of these matters, assisted by Halleck. Nether of em is as much
                     skairt as they mought be. Welles hes ben rekwired by the President to furnish a
                     force from the Navy Department and hes sent a messidge to the Maireens. The
                     Father of his Kentry is attendin to the deepenin of Tiber Crick, so as to bring
                     up the gunboat flowtiller, but he ses the mud is so thick that it is difficult
                     to run the masheen. The canawl throo the Heights, witch I spoke of in my last,
                     is not yet cumpleated, but as sun as it is the cavalry in that rejin will be
                     re-enforst with friggits and ships-of-the-line. Stanton calls for volunteers,
                     and Chase is on hand with the sinners of war. Seward doosent say mutch, but is
                     presoomed to be prepard for the onrepressabul conflick, and Blare is reddy to
                     cum forth when the trumpit sounds. In short, all the Constitooshinal Advisers
                     is in a state of eggsightment, witch, if not sublime, is within a step of
                     it.
                  The Adamantine Abraham is as cool and capabul as ever I seen him. No catastrofy
                     ken shake him enny more'n you could shake Mount Airyrat. He feels a little
                     ankshus about New York tho, and thinks it mought be well to hev a Monitor or
                     two in Spitendevil Crick.
                  "D. V.," ses he to me this mornin, "the Commershil Emporium must be defended to
                     the last gasp."
                  Ses I, "Troo, your Eggsellency; and when the New Yorkers see it
                        must, they will immediently muster."
                  He was satisfide. But he is onesy, tho he desdains to sho it, about
                     Philadelphy. I told him New York would rush to the reskew of her sister city
                     when the crysis came. He replide that he sposed so, and added, with his
                     customery beamin smild, that it was differcult for a city to stand firm when
                     thar was so menny Quakers in it.
                  The modern Patter Pattery and myself both thinks that the fate of
                     the kentry will be setteld within three weeks or a munth at furdest.
                  It that time it will ether be up, with us or down
                     with the rebels. Ef the men of the North air men, and ef the Army of the
                     Potomac, or rayther its offsirs, is wurth shucks, Lee and his murmurduns is
                     gonners. His invashin is the act of a madman, and onless our Ginrals is
                     downright idyots, his doom is sealt.
                  But it is now wun o'clock, post meriden, and I must mount and away. Ef I am
                     sezed and eggsecuted as a spy, send for my boddy—it ken be of no use to
                     ennyboddy in Jeffland—and berry me desently in sum kwiet spot oninfested by
                     Copperheds. Dont inter me, howsever, in these butternut rags; for I should
                     prefer to hev a desent coat put on me afore my Hic Jacket, is
                     ritten. Lay my swoord by my side, ef the rebs dont steel it, and put a slab
                     over it, with a neat inscripshin. I dont want enny flurrish about the
                     monnyment—a plain stun, not a stunner.
                  I oney menshin these things in case of the wurst. When a man dies, setch little
                     attenshins is agreeabul. But I persoonl thars no pertickler danger.
                  Wishin you a merry Forth of July, and myself and entry menny happy returns of

                  NAYSHINAL HOTTEL, WASHINGTON, July 9, 1863.
                  Eddyturs of the Sunday MerKary:
               
               When I rit last, on the thirtet ult., I was bound on a mishin, the ultimit result
                  of witch was onsartain. I was about to resk my neck on a neckscurshin of a neckstree hazardus
                  nater. It will giv you pleshur to larn that it was a cumpleat suckcess. I past
                  throo the rebel lines, got all the noose I wanted, and, in fack, hed my full swing
                  amung em without bein hauled up, or even suspishend. My dirty ragged soot, and a
                  peace of an old wig, daubed with red oker, witch I pertended to hev scalpt off a
                  mudsill's coconut, inspired confidens, and I was evrywhars wellcombed by the rebs
                  as a frend and cumraid. As I purfest to hev privit and speshil informashin as to
                  the moovements of the Army of the Potomac, I was took afore Ginral Lee, and hed
                  the pleshur of leadin him off on the false cent witch subsekwently enabled Ginral
                  Meade to put him throo the mill. The same night I made my eskape to Ginral Meade's
                  hed-kwarters, and posted him up as to the persishin of the enemee; arter witch I
                  started for Washington, by way of Philadelphy, and arrove here simultanus with the
                  intelligens that Lee was demoralised and Pemberton demolisht. Immediently on my
                  arrival I shed my Secesh habillyments, made my ablueshins, put on a clean shirt,
                  and reported at the White House. The President receved me with mutch feline. When
                  I enterd the sanktum, he opend his arms, and the next moment I was in Abraham's
                  buzzum. "Allbeat unused to the meltin mood", as the More of Venus ses, I thort I
                  should hev catterpillerd. Ine conshus that we both behaved like loonaticks, but
                  thar air moments when the emoshins of the human sole sets eteket at defiance. In
                  the midst of the tutchin seen, a messindger tapt at the door to say that the
                  Cabnet was waitin for Abraham in the East Room.
               "Tell the Cabnet they may go to—work, and Ile be thar presently," sed he, modifyin
                  his first idee as he finisht the sentence.
               Then turnin to me, he added, with a grayshus smild:
               "A frend reckognised by the hart takes preseedence of advisers appinted onder the
                  Constitooshin."
               "Yes," ses I, "solid meat first, and then bring in the flummery."
               We then sot down for a few minits to enjye a feast of resin, and, to mysten it, he
                  brort out the Mungoheeler and a gobblet, for my accommydashin. I say for my
                  accommydashin, bekase the President, bein strick temprance, drinkt to me oney with
                  his eyes.
               "How's the Potomac?" ses I, porin out a dram.
               "Brim-full, and runnin over," he replide.
               "Let her run!" I eggsclamed, takin a long swaller; "the harder she runs, the
                  longer Lee'll hev to stop on tuther side. Here's to the freshit," ses I, imbibin
                  agin.
               "Ditto," replide his eggsellency, larfin, "and may thar be no a-bridge-ment of the
                  current for the next forty-eight hours."
               "Is thar nary ford that'll afford him a chanst to cross?" I axed.
               "Nary—not ef evry traytor was as tall as I am," he responded, stretchin his lofty
                  bigger to its full altitood.
               "Ef thats the case," ses I, "they 'll be gobbled, and we shant need anuther draft.
                  Here's may we git along without wun!" I added, wunst more wettin my wissel.
               "Amen!" cried the Father of his Kentry. "Ef the Sutherners will oney lay down thar
                  arms and smoak the pipe of peace, we'll light it with the Cornskripshin act, berry
                  the hatchit, and giv all the provost-marshals births in the custom-house."
               At this junkter thar was anuther nock at the sanktum door, and the messindger
                  announst that the Constitooshinal Advisers was gittin the fidgits.
               "Bind my wedge!" sed the President, "Ide forgot all about em. Hedn't you, D. V.?
                  Split my mall! Wot do they want?"
               The page as brort the messidge sed he onderstood the honabul gentlemen wisht to
                  hold a consultashin with his Eggsellency the President on the affairs of the
                  nayshin.
               "I'd a nayshin rayther they'd let me pole the boat alone," remarkt the illustrus
                  cheef. "Howsever we air born to trubble, as the sparks fly uppards, so tell em to
                  cum in and fire away."
               In a few minnits arterwards they enterd the sanktum in single file—Seward the
                  Sentenshus at the head of the percesshin, and Welles the Witless at the tail eend.
                  They mooved with mesherd steps, as ef marchin to the music of the Union, and thar
                  toot in shamble was imposin. A Cabnet, takin it by and large, is an imposin
                  specktickle, and this pqliarly so, and allus hes ben. The Honabul Seckatry of
                  State, as your readers are awar, is a small man; but like most diminutiv
                  individyals is fond of makin hisself conspickuous and bein cock of the walk, and
                  hens, he led the van. Welles at the opposit eend, looked remarkably picteresk,
                  with a baird like a mounting goat and a crest like a cockytoo. Halleck had the
                  aperience of a gentman as felt his oats tryin to look moddest onder the pressher
                  of grate victories and Seckatry Stanton, the wether bein warm and muggy, looked
                  like bellygerent Mars in a perfuse prespirashin. The Seckatry of the Interior was
                  cool and kwiet, and Chase, as ushil, cam, dignified, and self-possesst. Blare
                  wouldn't be took by common white folks for a Cabnet Minister, but sum of our men
                  of letters consider him well fitted for the post. I spose you no he's the orthur of a work called Blare's
                  Retoric, of witch he gives illustrashins ockashinally at Aunty-Slavery meetins.
                  But why should I dwell on the asspecks and carrickters of these distingwisht men.
                  Thar fotagruffs air in evry winder, and thar prented dockments and speetches are
                  the best evidences of thar saygasity.
               As this enlitened boddy filed in, they (with the eggsepshin of the Treshury and
                  the Interior) regairded me with a witherin skowl of hatred and contemp. But it
                  dident wither me. Taint my natur to wilt onder the human eye. I stiffent up my
                  optickle narves, and gin em as good as they sent, ef not more so. But I seen they
                  wanted me outer the way, so I shuck hands with the President and left. What
                  happent at the intervew I dont know, as I hev not seen the Nayshin's Hope senst;
                  but I persoom they bullyragged him considabul.
               The city is full of sensashin rummers to-day. Sum ses that with the onpassabul
                  Potomac River on one side, and the invincibul Potomac Army on the uther, Lee will
                  not resk anuther battle, but like a prudent man, give in and cry pigavi. I don't
                  think so; but as all speckelashin on the subjeck will be at an eend afore this
                  letter is prented, I shant go inter the whys and warfores of the matter. In the
                  meantime, confidently awaitin the final victory, I remain, plassidly,

                  [The solicitude of our indefatigable correspondent for the peace and quiet of
                     New York appears to have monopolized his entire attention; but, like a good
                     many other equally distinguished people at Washington, he does not appear to
                     realize the true state of the case. The resistance to conscription in this city
                     did not originate through sympathy with the Southern Rebellion, but because of
                     the exercise of a despotic power to which our people were unused. If D. V. will
                     convince his distinguished friend, Abraham L., that conscription at the present
                     time is injudicious, unwise, and unnecessary, as it is, he will be doing the
                     country as much service as did Gen. Grant in the capture of
                     Vicksburg.—EDS.]

                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               Hes New York sold itself to the Devil, and hes pay-day cum round, or wot? Spose
                  the cornskripshin Lor was obnockshus, is that enny resin for seens that would
                  disgrace the Seeyou Injuns. The Cornskripshin Act is no faverite of mine, as you
                  and the readers of the Sunday Merkary is well aware, but is encinderism, robbery,
                  and uther crimes that cannybuls would be ashamed of, a mannyfestashin of
                  hosstility to the Draft Lor. No, they air the acts of atroshus misscreants,
                  opposed to all lors of God and man, and the oney way to meet em is with grape and
                  canister, riful balls and bagnets. I hevent a shadder of a dout that afore this
                  letter is put in prent, the mob in New York will hev reseved setch a lessin as
                  will be a warnin to all rioters for fifty years to cum. The ring-leaders, I
                  persoom, will be diskivered, and ef they air, I trust they will get thar
                  desarts.
               It is the ginral opinyun here that the row was got up in the hope of helpin the
                  South by a divershin in its faver at the very moment when the Union armies was
                  evrywar victoryus. It hes ben known for sum time by the Fedral orthorities that
                  thar was a sekrit conspurracy agen the Guverment in New York. It was also known
                  that rebel emiseries was at work thar, and that ef Vicksburg was took, and Lee was
                  whipt, thar was to be a traiter outbrake in the North. This was Jeff Davises
                  forlorn hope—the last keard of the rebellyun. Well Vicksburg is ourn, Port Hudson
                  is ourn, Lee is licked, Bragg is floored, Jo Johnston is flyin from the rath to
                  cum, Price is discomforted, Charlestun is as good as gon, Mobile is spoken for,
                  and the last keard of Treason is played in New York. But the dern yer resort will
                  fail. In spite of the simperthisers the rebellyun is a goner. Nearly two-thirds of
                  Jeffdom is conkerd, and the rest is cavin in. This infarnal riot may giv the rebel
                  leaders a little encurridgement, but it wont be of enny substanshil bennyfit. Let
                  the cornskripshin be gin up. We don't need it. We ken finish up the biziness with
                  the forces we hev now in the field, and freewill recrutes. Four hunderd and fifty
                  peaces of artillery and a hunderd and fifty thousand stands of small arms hev
                  fallen into our hands within the last twenty days, and about one hunderd thousand
                  rebel sojers hes ben put horse de combat. Our land forces outnumbers theirn, full
                  two to wun, to say nuthin of the Navy. I say we've got em. Salt won't save em. The
                  last ditch is closte at hand, and they won't die in it, depend on that. Didn't Pemberton say he'd die sooner'n
                  yield, and hesent he caved, and all his major-ginrals and bragadears with him.
                  Human nater's human nater. When Shiverally kant fight enny longer, it cries enuff
                  jest as kwick as enny uther man. Oney think of it, we took four thousand
                  offsirs—"the best blud ot the South" —at Vicksburg, and another big batch of the
                  high cockalorum fellers of the "superur race" at Port Hudson. I tell you theyre
                  played out. I giv em credit for pluck and parseverance, but they kant save
                  tharselves. They'd hev gon onder long ago, ef thar'd ben wun forth as mutch branes
                  in the heds of our roolers as thar was pluck in the harts of our sojers. But
                  better late than never.
               Ime sorry New York has disgraced itself jest in the hour of triump; but I am
                  confident that afore this letter sees the light lor and order will wunst more hev
                  ben restored.
               Lookin for that result as confidently as I do for Sunday mornin's sun, I remain,

                  Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:
               
               We air amazin jolly here. Halleck looks as ef he'd hed a legasy left him, and the
                  President ses he feels esier in his boots evry time the tellagraft brings wurd
                  that the rebels hes got anuther weltin. You never seen a man fuller of fun than he
                  is. It breaks out spontanus in the midst of the gravest bizness, and shakes the
                  hull Cabnet, from Wellses top-not down to the saft corns on Stanton's toes. He ses
                  he doosent see why a man should look as solem as an ondertaker bekase he happens
                  to be in the President's cheer. I gess he's right; Bucannon, you no, was an
                  everlastin solem un, and see what he cum to. By the way, whar's that book of his'n
                  that Judge Black was to rite, to put him throo with posteriority?
               Sartainly ef ever thar was a time when the fiends of E P Unum hed a rite to rejice
                  its now. He's mounted the Secesh bird to sum porpus at last, and why shouldn't he
                  flop his wings and cro.
               Charlestun's goin to git goss this time, and no mistake. Wagner whips em, and that
                  fort may possably be ourn afore you receve this letter. When the Dollgrins begin
                  to tork to Fort Sumter, I rayther think the smildin villidge of Charlestun will be
                  apt to larf on the rong side of its mouth. I want that deliteful poplar
                  institooshin leveled down as smooth as the back of yer hand, and sum salt
                  keerfeelly sowed over its ruins.
               Lee hesent got back to Richmound yet, and accordin to the Cabnet program he's to
                  be "gobbled" this week. But I hevent much faith in Cabnet programs—hev you? When
                  the Constitooshinal advisers put thar hand to ennything, as a ginral thing they
                  put thar foot in it. Evryboddy knows that ef Richmound hed ben in the Mussysippi
                  Valley it would hev suckumbed to our arms long ago. Ef the War Department hedent
                  aloud Meade a cart blench in that last shindy I dessay he'd a
                  ben knockt eendways. Youve heerd wot old Jo Hooker sed, I spose. "The Army of the
                  Potomac," ses he, "fights the enemee two hours outer the twenty-four and the rest
                  of the time is spent in tellagraffic skirmishin with Washington." Thar never was a
                  trooer bit of sourchasm.
               The Richmound papers is plesent readin about these days. Epitaffs is cheerful in
                  caparison. But wot I pertickerly admire is the meet ax stile in which the
                  Richmound Wig gets inter Jeff Davises har. His speshil organ, it seems, goes in
                  for givin Jeff a Digtatership, and argews that in the present desput strait of the
                  Suthern Cornfedracy, thars nuthen for it but desputism. The Wig on the other hand,
                  intimates in the pianist kinder langwidge, that it hes no confidens wotsumdever
                  either in the honesty or the abilities of the Suthern rooler, and respeckfully
                  objecks to his bein an abesalute monnick. The North hes made Lincoln wun, it ses,
                  and it pertests agin heving setch a foo-foo as Jeff Davis to play tyrant over the
                  Shiverally. Its a very nice quarl, but as the hull consarn is on its last legs,
                  its very foolish in em to pitch inter wun anuther as they go to the devil.
               I notis in the ackounts from Vicksburg that not a single nigger prisner was found
                  in the wurks. The inferens is that they was all massacreed as sun as capterd, for
                  its well known that a good menny was took. Like thar speshil and partickler
                  frends, the New York mob, the rebel sujers murderd the onfortnit critters in cold blud. This is
                  the Nineteent Sentry I bleve, and we live in a Christian land. Sartain—speshilly
                  the Christian. Sum Nuthern demagogs allows that this war of ourn is a war for the
                  elivashin of the Nigger. Ef it is, I ken oney say that I hope Sambo likes it; but
                  ef I belonged to the black resarves of Shinbone Alley, I should resine immedient.
                  This gettin no kwarter ether in milentary service or in civil sosity is more
                  eggsitin than hulsum.
               The Presedent and me has ben torkin over the ginral prospecks of the camppain
                  to-day, and we hev cum to the conclushin that the beginnin of the eend is more
                  than three parts throo. Prehaps, when Mobile, Charlestun, Savannah and Richmound
                  hes hung out the white flag, we may be magnannymus, and offer the messgided
                  retches terms that they will jump at. The great stumblin-block is our
                  woolly-hedded bruther. We've promist that he shell be forever free, but mebbe
                  onder all the suckemstances he wouldn't mind postponyin the matter a wile and
                  takin his libty in periodical doses. Ennyhow there'd be no harm in axin him, and
                  ef he agreed it mought save afewshin of blud.
               John Bull's a remarkabul saygashus feller, isent he? How well he guest the fate of
                  Lee's host in Pennsylvany. The London Times proffersied that Jeff
                  Davis would dicktate turms of peace from Washington. How air you Thunderer? Ime
                  curus to see how the British oriculs is goin to crawl out. Wun thing's shure,
                  they've got to stop fittin out Rebel men-of-war. My friend Abraham is good-naterd
                  to a folt; but as he remarkt to me when we last disgust the subjeck, thar is a
                  pint at witch piracy ceses to be a virtoo. That pint has been reeched, and John
                  Bull may confidently eggspect kicks ef he continners to countnance free booting.
                  Whiting hes gone over to giv him fare warnin, and he's either got to fall back or
                  fite. A joak's a joak, but this prayin on our commerce in British bottoms, is a
                  bellygerent act, and kan't be tolerated enny longer. Hoping that Whiting will do
                  the matter up brown, and indooce John Bull to do wot he hates to when it
                  interfears with his intrests, and that's justice. I remain, as ushil,
               
                  Yours allus,
                  A DISBANDED VOLUNTEER.
               
            
            THE END.
