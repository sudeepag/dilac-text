               ENTERED, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1862, by FANNY BARROW, In
                  the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern
                  District of New York.
            
         
         
            TO MRS. JOHN A. DIX, THE LOVELY WOMAN, THE GOOD FRIEND, AND THE TRUE
               CHRISTIAN, THIS BOOK IS MOST RESPECTFULLY AND AFFECTIONATELY
               Dedicated.
         
         
            
            INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.
            TO MESSIEURS THE CRITICS—ALSO, THE DEAR PUBLIC.
            CRITICS are fearfully and wonderfully made. They are congestive, as to their livers;
               they are supernaturally bilious; their brains are incessantly stirred up by wildly
               incongruous doses, such as a quarto volume on "Morphological Development," and the
               thrilling tale of "The Yankee Schoolmistress, or the Fatal Pistol." They must digest
               both as they can at the same time. They must review these diverse books at the rate
               of fifty a week; they must burn the midnight oil; they neglect to put coals on the
               dying fire, and by consequence they are in a chronic condition of headache, earache,
               toothache, and sore throat all at once. How then, in the name of that Common Sense
               which has no respect for circumstances or the abuser of Nature's laws, can a critic
               do other than hate or despise his tormentors—the books.
            And yet there is nothing more valuable to an author than a kindly criticism. If mixed
               with praise, it is accepted by the public as letters patent of merit.
            
            A good writer says that criticism frequently "lacks imagination, as well as charity
               and humility." The critic persists in "commenting upon the works of others from his
               own peculiar ground and point of view." He will not look at what is done "with a due
               regard to the doer's drift and conception." He has the dyspepsia, nine times out of
               ten; and thus he breaks a poor little butterfly like mine upon his inquisitorial
               wheel without benefit of jury.
            I have tried, by special request, this new, not higher flight; for
               children "are of the kingdom of Heaven," while we grown folks are to be divided—some
               taken, others left.
            Now one kind word (if in the least deserved) is a matter of no small solicitude. One
               drop of sympathy to a beginner, sensitive to discouragement, would be like water to
               the solitary traveller thirsting in the desert.
            Quite dissatisfied with my work, I am certain that if you try me, even by what the
               lawyers call "a Court of Equity," and Clients "purgatory," it will be my epitaph, and
               utterly disarrange and drive to sixes and sevens the ideas I am cultivating for my
               next much-better-book. Instead of endeavoring only to amuse, my despairing gray
               goose-quill will be tempted to perpetrate a numskullical didactic fiction, which,
               like that dreadful creature, "a perfect pattern of a woman," will be running over
               with pernicious excellences, with a "sharp, horny toe of a moral sticking out at the
               end," instead of being a gentle, invisible leading-string from the beginning; and my
               reader, my dear, lovable reader, will make up a horrible face, as the little boy did
               when he was feloniously induced to shut his eyes and open his mouth to receive the
               spoonful of jam which had a dose of pills in the middle of it.
            Consider, dear critic (you are not dyspeptic), while you
               are discussing your matutinal toast and me, that my stories, save two, are simple
               accounts of events happening to veritable men and women within the past year. Yes,
               they are all alive at this moment! Some will laugh at their pen-portrait; others will
               come and pinch me black and blue for telling. "Cousin Miranda" is much
               longer and stronger than I. She will probably shake the breath out of my body; or, to
               use her own words, shake me into "conniptions," and most likely exclaim, "What on
               airth do you mean printing of me? It beats all natur! It don't square with my idees
               at all, and then she'll shake me again.
            As to "Little Mrs. Bell" (that's not her name; but she'll find me out, nevertheless),
               I have given orders to be particularly engaged for a month or two, when she calls. Of
               the rest of the good people, I am not afraid. "Little Sister," truth compels me to
               own, is as Mantilini says, "a demnition reality;" though I declare and protest that
               all I said and did, served the parties just right. "Enfant terrible" indeed! How much
               more terrible it would be if an innocent child
               did not speak the truth, and shame the d with a dash. This estimable
               quality of my childhood has developed in my womanhood into a highly improving
               "faculty," as Miss Ophelia calls it, for asking questions, one of the consequences of
               which I have given in "The yard of black silk elastic."
            The absurdity of "Corsets" was suggested by a French story, as one might surmise; and
               I have adapted it to the needs of a certain finical fashionable fribbler of my
               acquaintance, who is lacing her daughters into their very genteel graves; after which
               event the mother's consoling thought will be "Alas! we must be genteel
               or die—or genteel and die." The "Marble Bust" is a translation, very
               much altered; but for which, when we poor abused authors get our national and
               international rights, I shall offer to pay. "Buzz! buzz! buzz!" say the publishers
               who do a little of this thing; "change the subject! It is getting personal!"
            There is so much, dear critic (I am coaxing you now), in name—good, bad, or assorted.
               Even the great Shakespeare was loveable and human, because he made mistakes. A name
                  is life or death to many things. Let me tell an anecdote to
               illustrate:
            A certain great man, you will know who by the text, announced a lecture. The people,
               well primed by foregone conclusions, gotten from all his previous books and lectures,
               thronged the place with many dozen of gallons of laugh, bottled up, and were all
               eyes, ears, attention and irresistible chuckle. The Dr. is a small man, of quick
               nervous movements. He jumped up like Jack in the box and commenced by gravely
               announcing that this was going to be a very serious sort of thing. They all yelled
               with laughter! Somewhat discomposed he proceeded to read the first line. Screams,
               shrieks of laughter!! By-and-by they found that it was not intended to be funny at
               all; and the whole thing fell as flat as a pancake.
            So much for a name!!
            P.S.—Simply and earnestly, if one soul heavy with care, whirling along in a railroad
               car, or sitting by the winter fire, is beguiled out of its brooding grief, for an
               hour, by reading these stories, as mine—God be thanked!—has been out of many by
               writing them; then shall I have a grateful and thankful heart, for the loving and
               lovable part of my intention will have been accomplished.
            Adieu, or au revoir, as you please.

            THE WIFE'S STRATAGEM.
            
               CHAPTER I
               AS PROLOGUE, IF YOU PLEASE, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE
                  BOOK.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Give me a bowl of wine:
                           I have not that alacrity of spirit,
                           Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have."
                        
                     
                     SHAKESPEARE.
                  
               
               
                  Feb. 7, 1862.—IT was half after ten at night. Snow and sleet were
                  dashing past the window's and the angry wind howled like a wild animal.
               Within, all was warm, bright, cosy. Two young persons, husband and wife, sat on
                  either side of the fire. A small silver teakettle on the table was piping
                  tunefully to the, potent suasion of an alcohol lamp which burned beneath. A
                  cut-glass decanter, half full of rum, a silver sugar bowl, a lemon—Halt!!! Did I
                  say all was warm, bright, and cosy?
               
               There was a sound of a hiccup, followed by a deep, sobbing sigh.
               "Take a night-cap, dear," said the husband. "It will make you sleep well. I sleep
                  like a top now, thank Heaven."
               He held toward his wife the thing which Mr. Joseph Miller tells us the lawyers use
                  when they "warm up with the subject;" "a glass concern with a spoon in it, holding
                  about half a pint."
               "I am not sympathetic with that sort of article," quoth she, glancing shrewishly
                  at the spoon.
               The husband understood, and felt thundery for a moment; then, remembering in time
                  the admirable distinction which the profound and amiable Dr. Watts had impressed
                  upon his infant mind "of the line of conduct which good Christians should follow,
                  and that excusable, if not commendable, in bears and lions," swallowed the coming
                  growl and sighed again.
               Presently he remonstrated—"When a fellow has lost all he is worth by those deuced
                  Southern fellows, just as a fellow felt so comfortable! I should like to know how
                  a fellow can help taking to nightcaps, pocket pistols, and chain lightning, and
                  let them cheat him out of his tormenting regrets grets with a note-shaver's usury.
                  I'll be hanged!" he continued, jerking himself up out of his chair, and plunging
                  his hands so deep in his pockets that it made him hunch up his shoulders; "I'll be
                  hanged if I know in six months from now where I am to get the money for dinner,"
                  and he strode to the bell, rang it violently, and ordered Betty to tell Bridget to
                  broil the roast beef bones and devil the turkey's legs, "with plenty of red
                  pepper, mind!" and send them up immediately.
               The superstitious little wife shuddered. Broiled bones! and the devil! dear me how
                  horrible! quite a foreshadowing of what he was coming to, if he went on in this
                  way much longer; for the nightcaps, pocket pistols, &c., nightly became longer
                  and stronger, and the frizzling and sizzling of the broiled bones, with the
                  frequent conjunction of that other red peppered, if not horned and cloven
                  arrangement, was a brace of facts, the taking in of which, in a different way, was
                  quite as stimulating to her as the edibles and drinkables to him, and would, she
                  declared, soon drive her as crazy as a coot.
               What to do. Take advice? Ask it at any rate. So the next morning the little
                  troubled heart came to me, kissed me,
                  deliberately took out a clean pocket handkerchief perfumed with my favorite
                  Marechal, and fell a-crying.
               Without the faintest idea what it was all about, but determined to fulfil my duty
                  as set, forth by St. Paul, of being all things to, &c., I took out
                     my clean pocket handkerchief, and sniffed in concert quite
                  tunefully.
               Presently and inevitably she blew her nose.
               Pray let me ask, why, in the name of all that's high-flying, can't women cry as
                  they do in romances? Who ever heard of these sorrowing beauties, three fourths
                  angels, blowing their noses? Nine times out of ten they have none; at least no,
                  mention is made of them. When a lover is bending over his angel, whispering his
                  vows, her happy tears are quietly dropping like pearls.
               When my Fitz-Clarence offered himself, I was so glad I cried for joy;
                  and with secret rage at the necessity, sounded a horn, which was also a deathblow
                  as far as the romance went.
               Well, then, the little wife rubbed her eyes, &c., and sighed out: "Aunt, I've
                  come to you for help and comfort."
               "And you shall have it, dear," I answered, as I kissed her flushed cheek. Now, if
                  you meanly seek to know if her nose was also flushed, I scorn to hesitate one
                  moment in telling you that it was! very much flushed.
                     "We live." She in Madison avenue, opposite the white marble
                  church; I in Fifteenth street, near Union Park.
               Advice that is to come between husband and wife requires a conjuror's skill; and
                  sooth to say, I did not know how to begin.
               While I was biting my nail to help my brains, the little wife pulled her other
                  ungloved hand out of her muff, and began nervously turning a ring on her
                  forefinger round and round. Then it occurred to her that I might possibly be
                  assisted in my efforts to administer comfort if I knew why she had asked for it;
                  and so she told me, with relapses of weeping here and there, how, as I already
                  knew, Harry had been so well off when they were married; how everything had gone
                  on so splendidly; the sale of goods to the South increasing, until he was quite a
                  rich man—on paper—and he had intended to retire from business this very spring,
                  because he loved her a thousand times more than ever since little Carrie was,
                  born, and could not bear to be separated from them all day; and then, oh! then the dreadful war had come, and (sob) and
                  (sob) all the happiness was over.
               "Why?" I asked.
               "Oh, aunt! you know how good he was! and I believe in my heart that it was because
                  he was so good, neither drinking nor smoking, that he was successful in business.
                  He even disliked oysters, which is almost incredible! but perhaps another reason
                  for his many virtues (I came very near laughing at this); for oysters, you know,
                  always go with champagne and hot whiskey punch; but now (sob) he has sent home
                  brandy and (sob) whiskey, and oh! oh! (sob) RUM. He drinks them every night, and
                  goes to bed tip- (sob) sy; oh! what shall I do?"
               Poor little thing! I drew my chair close to hers, and laid her head on my
                  shoulder, and let her sob and sniff, and so forth, till she grew quiet, and then,
                  quoth I—
               "We must take him in hand, dear. We must find some pleasant distraction for his
                  evenings." At that moment—don't sneer, the right thing does happen in
                  the right time and place, once in a blue moon, in real life—at that moment the
                  ring she had been twisting round her finger fell off, and rolled into a corner. I
                  picked it up, and saw it was a circle ornamented with a very fine opal, surrounded
                  by small but brilliant diamonds. I knew it in a moment, and a thought struck
                  me.
               "You know all about this ring?"
               "I've read the story mamma wrote," she answered.
               "Well, I will wager a hundred dollars to a ten cent piece, that she did not tell
                  you all the circumstances. Mothers, as a general thing, desire to maintain their
                  normal position of awful perfectness and dignity in the eyes of their progeny.
                  Never did they cut up capers when they were wild good-for-noth—; I mean, when they
                  were lovely and gentle young girls! Oh no! But, nevertheless, I will just tell you
                  all about it.
               "When your mother was about sixteen, your father was distractedly in love with
                  her; made a superfine donkey of himself on various occasions. They were both such
                  children, that your grandmamma turned him out of the house three several times.
                  They would take a despairing, eternal leave of each other; he would stay away one
                  evening, on which evening she would keep up such a dismal groaning and sighing
                  that it set everybody's teeth on edge,
                  and made a thorough draught of east wind all through the house. The very next
                  evening he would come in just as usual, leaving your grandmamma so aghast and
                  speechless at his impudence that it seemed quite a matter of course; and the long
                  and the short of it was, that she could not help herself, and they became
                  engaged.
               "As to your grandpapa, he examined his favorite authority, Shakespeare, and with
                  that assistance gravely came down upon his wife with 
                     
                        "'Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
                        Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
                        As seek to quench the fire of love with words.'
                     
                  
               
               "After a while your father declared that he could not exist another moment without
                  your mother's miniature, to stare at all day long, when he ought to be studying
                  law; so she went, after he had settled the preliminaries, to a Mrs. Bogardus, who
                  painted miniatures admirably on ivory.
               "This was not the momentary posing to his majesty the sun, who is miniature
                  painter to all the world, his wife and children, in these times. Your mother went
                  every day for a month, and being a tormenting gipsy, made faces, sat awry, shut
                  one eye, and otherwise disported herself, till Mrs. Bogardus was half crazy—so
                  many-sided was the expression of her sitter's face.
               "It was in summer time, and through the crack of the wide open door a young
                  gentleman, brother to Mrs. Bogardus, gazed on the sitter and listened to her
                  chatter. He heard her say on one occasion that she wrote poetry—she meant rhymes,
                  young poetry, 'veal.' As he was an editor of a magazine, he preferred a request
                  through his sister, that the lively little sprite should write something for him.
                  What an honor! to appear in print! She blushed and smiled, but being somewhat
                  afraid of venturing on poetry for the public eye, offered a story instead; and
                  shutting herself up in her own room, so her mother should not find her out, wrote
                  the 'Opal Ring.' It was a comical story, and more of it true than you imagine; and
                  now I'll tell your what to try. Harry is quite a genius in inventing odd stories;
                  he wants something to do, which will take his mind off of his troubles in the
                  evenings. Propose to him to organize a club of half a dozen or more persons, whose
                  brains are something besides train oil and dough. Harry, to begin, will take this
                  story of the "Opal Ring," improve it all he can; put in some more of the dreadful things they tell
                  you. I, your grave aunt, did, when a child, and you must coax Harry to add
                  something original of his own. Then have one evening in the week for the meeting
                  together and readings. After your story, I will present one; and all the rest,
                  fired by a desire for emulation, like geese following one another across a road,
                  will each write their possible, which may not, will not, resemble that useful,
                  silly bird in any other respect. And if it should, dear child! if we should all
                  charge our pens with nonsense, provided it be innocent and for a good purpose, we
                  have the Divine promise that 'the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle
                  to the strong,' and a brave, resolute, undaunted little Monitor like you, will,
                  with His blessing, so cripple the monsters we are fighting against that your
                  husband himself will light the match that will destroy what is left. Keep this up
                  as long as you can. The beginning of the end of this wretched conflict is at band,
                  and then Harry will get something to do. Encourage him, cheer him, laugh at him,
                  make light of all deprivations which may be necessary—yes! even seem to get on
                  better with them. Meet him at the very door when he comes home, with a kiss and a
                  smile; and above all with little Carrie in your arms; that will be a great gun! Be
                  a little hypocrite, my poor daring! If your heart is heavy, sing; if you, are on
                  the point of bursting out crying, say something remarkably funny.
                  You, poor little soul! must be strong-hearted for two; and the other
                  six feet high. Oh it ishard! but it is the lot of a good wife to do
                  moonshine by night, and sunshine by day, be the clouds as black as Erebus, and
                  bitter strokes of fortune falling like thunderbolts on every side."
               Stop! What was I doing? Babbling like a fool, all on the dark side of things. So I
                  resisted further temptation in this line, and chirped inspiritingly about our
                  plan.
               "Oh! Aunt, do you think I could do anything so delightful?"
               "Try," I cried; "begin to-night. Let me see. Let's recapitulate: You and little
                  Carrie at the door. Kisses. The dining-room. Bright fire. Nice little dinner.
                  Carrie at dessert; previously taught to say, I love papa mostest. Of
                  course he will remonstrate with you for teaching her to say so, and be, immensely
                  delighted, nevertheless.
               "After dinner, a kiss; a remarkably funny thing Carrie said or did during the day, to which he will
                  listen with ears like a hare's; and roars of laughter. Then propose THE PLAN, with
                  judicious hints of the immortal fame he will acquire if he puts only
                  quarter the funny things he says in writing; quite put out such smaller lights as
                  Sydney Smith, Charles Lamb, &c. Never mind his slang of 'I don't seem to see
                  it;' keep up a perfect volley of coaxings, till he puts pen to paper. He is really
                  such a clever fellow that once get him there, you are safe and he is saved.
                  There!! What do you think?"
               How her face brightened! She looked so lovely! the unbecoming red
                  tint had left her poor, innocent nose, and settled upon her cheeks, and after
                  kissing and thanking me, she bade me "good-by," and tripped home, a happy,
                  comforted little woman.
               That night, if the welcome footsteps approaching outside were not listened for by
                  two small pretty pink ears, surmounted by a little killing French cap, then set me
                  down for a regular ninny-hammer! The programme, as printed above, was enacted and
                     not acted, con amore. At capital little dinner, crowned by his
                  favorite dessert, meringue apple pie, was discussed with immense satisfaction.
                  Then Carrie came in with the astounding "I love you mostest, papa,"
                  exactly at the critical moment; for the little wife with a sinking heart, had
                  observed that he was looking at the decanter on the buffet, and had half risen to
                  get it. The sweet, small voice seemed to be heaven-inspired. He stopped short!
                  turned; looked at his little child, then taking her in his arms fairly burst into
                  tears, crying. "Oh! Carrie, my darling, I have beggared both you and your mother;
                  don't love me! don't love me! Oh! my God! how unhappy I am!"
               She flew to him, that good little wife! She curled her arms round his neck. One
                  gasping sob, and then she said bravely, "Oh! no, Harry! not ruined, while we have
                  you and you have us. See! we will help each other! we are young! we are strong!
                  This dreadful war cannot last forever! if we have to struggle a few years, our
                  being together will make privations sweet. Let me discharge every servant but one.
                  I own the house that is so fortunate, isn't it, dear?" (kissing him). I shall soon
                  learn to do without a great many things; indeed, so many, servants are very troublesome; and my health really
                  requires that I should take more exercise round the house, you know (little
                  hypocrite). Come, don't you see we are not so badly off. Besides, I have a plan
                  here she spoke very fast),a capital plan, for our evenings;" and she told him, in
                  her own loving, coaxing way, what we had concocted together.
               Only a heart of marble could have resisted her. Harry's was flesh and blood; it
                  was bleeding a little now; for her agitation, and involuntary glancing at the
                  awful decanter—her sweet face, now deadly pale, now crimson, with alternate fear
                  and hope—showed him, how cruelly he had wounded the true heart which beat only for
                  him. Yes! he saw it all, with the same bright, sensitive intelligence that had won
                  his fortune and his wife; with the same intelligence which gave a sharper edge to
                  that fratricidal Southern sword, which had not only robbed him of his honest
                  gains, but cut many cords asunder far more precious than gold, and had driven him
                  to the miserable madness of flying to strong drink to obtain temporary
                  forgetfulness; and now, wretch that he was! he was doing his best to disgust his
                  wife and forfeit his dearest earthly possession—her love.
               All these thoughts went through him like a sword, keener, more unsparing than the
                  first; and there and then he mad a solemn, silent vow, and sealed it with a kiss
                  upon the innocent lips of his little child. Then he smiled upon her, and little
                  Carrie sang again, with her sweet robin's note, "I love you mostest,
                  papa!"
               Cunning little Carrie!!!
               "And so the plan, the great plan, succeeded. Harry went head, hand, and brain into
                  the work that same evening. No silver teakettle was visible with its ominous
                  hissing; no horrible decanter of rum stood, sentinel upon the table, like an
                  advance-guard of Beelzebub, charged to the muzzle and ready to pour death into
                  him. A little joyous chirrup from his wife made music as he wrote. Steadily, he
                  wrote for four—oh what pleasant quiet evenings! and then the first story was
                  finished. Courage, little wife! The enemy is repulsed.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               A GRAND CONSULTATION OF THREE.
               "WHO shall we invite to become members of our club?"
               "I propose Mr. and Mrs. Wilton," I answered. "She is piquante, pretty, witty, and
                  the best of all, a delicious little vixen. He is good-humored, good-tempered, and
                  good-looking."
               Unanimously elected; and Harry immediately wrote a note, which I may as well add
                  here, was answered "delighted to come."
               "There's young Appreciate," suggested Harry, "one of the few of 'Young America'
                  who have not crooked legs, are not forever twisting their mustaches, and pulling
                  up their shirt collars. I know he says his prayers. Mirabile dictu!"
               Ah! that last piece of information was an argumentum ad
                     hominem to the little wife, for she immediately cried out—
               "Says his prayers? Oh yes! Appreciate! Have him by all means!"
               "God boy!" I echoed. He prays, as we all do, pro aris et
                     focis." You see I wanted to show Harry what a tremendous scholar I
                  was, so I fired at him one of the three Latin phrases I knew. The effect I
                  produced was satisfactory.
               We must have a young lady as vis-a-vis to our young Gentleman. I should like to
                  invite my sweet young cousin Adelaide, aunt. It is true she is only fifteen, but
                  she talks, more pearls and diamonds than many women I know twice her years, and
                  twenty times her conceit."
               "She is all that you say, dear. My darling is one in a thousands simple, natural,
                  and noble; and I, her mother, can say this to you without fear of being laughed at
                  for blind partiality."
               "Cousin Adelaide is only one, remove from an angel, and I know, just as well as if
                  it had already taken, place, what will happen," said Harry "We will introduce
                  Appreciate. She will give him a curtsey and a smile so brimful of sunshine, that
                  he will be struck motionless with admiration—the usual figure very young men cut
                  on such occasions. She will make a highly commonplace place remark, at which he will flush all over and
                  quake about the knees. Love at first sight! You see? and in six weeks I'll bet a
                  hat he will ask her to share his 'home and gizzard.'
               "Aren't you ashamed?" laughed "the little wife," whose face fairly beamed at the
                  prospect of a love affair, which she mentally resolved to further with might and
                  main, as if one stratagem on her hands, at one time, were not enough. "How can you
                  spoil all the romance with your 'gizzard.' Dear little Adelaide! Won't it be
                  delightful, aunty, to make such a nice match for her?"
               "Oh very," I snapped, for I did not like to have Adelaide so unceremoniously
                  appropriated. "And so everybody must have somebody, but me. You two turtledoves,
                  Mr. and Mrs. Wilton, Appreciate and Adelaide. Who's to do the civil to
                     me, I should like to know?"
               "Hm!" said Harry, with a malicious sparkle in his, eyes. "There's that crusty,
                  cynical, amusing, peregrinating volcano, old Mr. Gracie Growler, who seems to
                  consider it his mission to pitch into everything, from Alpha to Omega. I wish you
                  could have heard him in his counting-room the other day, blazing away at his
                  sister, because she laced up her
                     PORTRAIT OF MR. GROWLER.
                  
                   daughters till they creaked at the least
                  movement, and breathed in short puffs, like propellers. He declared it was 'high
                  pressure' with two d's for introductory epithet; and ended by shouting out, 'No!
                  not one grain, sir! of the salt which chains down and laces up consciences, lungs,
                  free speech, true religion, or slaves, shall rest on the glorious tail of
                     my Bird of Liberty! No, sir! Conventionalities, French corsets,
                  and Mrs. Grundy be hanged! Dirt, somebody has written, is only a conventionality,
                  sir. Don't dirt make corn and grass? Answer me that! don't grass make fat oxen?
                  don't fat oxen and corn make the pretty young lady I saw you kissing the other
                  day?' facing round upon young Appreciate, who turned all sorts of colors. 'Yes,
                  sir! There's those girls of my silly sister's, nearly cut in two! they look like
                  wasps with the toothache. Cui bono?'
               "I can tell you," continued Harry, "he's a great card; and then his grumpiness
                  will set off aunty's sweetness and amiability."
               "Very good buncombe, that last," said I, by way of concealing how pleased I was
                  with his flattery. "Mr. Growler will make eight—just a pleasant number; and, as
                  most of our stories are in fact but one
                  family history we shall. enjoy them with intense zest."
               "Well, then, it's all settled," chirped the little wife, "I'm so grateful to you,
                  dear aunty! darling old general! But—and—oh! How about having refreshments? You
                  know we can't afford—now—to—" she stopped.
               "Nonsense!" I exclaimed, "Who wants pate-de-foie-gras and champagne? Still, I believe the feast of
                  reason and flow of soul is generally voted, even by æsthetic people, as an æriform
                  fluid, delightful to take, but a little too thin for the digestive organs,
                  considered materially. So we will have some chocolate and sponge cake; and if you
                  think the men folks are above eating cake, as childish and womanish, have some
                  mannish sandwiches, made, after my receipt."
               "Certainly! No red pepper, I hope?"
               "No mustard. And now, voila! When you eat other
                  people's sandwiches you may be morally and physically certain that in fourteen
                  times out of fourteen you draw about a quarter of a yard of ham out at the first
                  bite. The ham depends elegantly from the corner of your mouth, until by a series
                  of frantic chewings and tearings with your fingers— it suddenly drops. This is
                  decidedly unpleasant. Now! Have a nice boiled ham; cut a sufficient quantity of
                  fat and lean in great slices; put these in a chopping-bowl, and chop them into a
                  fine, paste. Then mix well with it, for two pounds of ham, two tablespoonfuls of
                  Maille's French mustard; cut the bread thin; butter it; and spread it thick with
                  the ham; put two slices together; the one who says this sandwich is not delicious,
                  must be a salamander without a looking-glass.*
                  
               
               
                  *We advise all husbands, sons, and brothers to get the authorities at home
                     to give them an opportunity to test these admirable sandwiches. We are
                     certain they will declare that the receipt is worth the whole price of the
                     book.—PUB.
               
               "That sounds GOOD!" cried Harry, jumping up with great energy. "Why aunty, you
                  must be the veritable 'Admirable Crichton' disguised in petticoats! What
                     don't you know, I should like to know?"
               "I do know we shall have same very pleasant evenings with all these friendly faces
                  and, kind hearts around us. As to Mr. Growler, I know him better than you do. His
                  bark is ever so much worse than his bite. His sister told me the other day that he
                  came home perfectly miserable because he
                  had not provided himself with pennies enough to give to all the little
                  tatterdemalions, that sweep the crossings, 'Short by four,' he whined, in great
                  tribulation, 'I thought thirty-one would be enough.' 'Nasty little wretches!'
                     she, ejaculated, 'what does he bother his head, about them
                  for?'"
               "Ah," said Harry. "That is the woman that is lacing her daughters to death. What
                  can you expect from a 'heart of stone?'"
               "And a wooden head," I added; "but seems to me we are getting scandalous; I move
                  that this meeting adjourn."
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               "NOW came still evening on." The evening! and the little wife's
                  stratagem was fast ripening to its first fruition. Everything was ready. She had
                  made mountains of sandwiches. The delicate sponge cake all brown and golden, had
                  been cut in generous pieces and piled high in the silver basket; and the chocolate
                  was primed ready for fire. But the little foot nervously patted the carpet; the
                  brow, though resolute, was knit with care. A prayer was in her heart; and two
                  rebellious tears, that would not be choked back, brimmed over, and rolled quietly
                  down her cheeks. What was to be a simple amusement for an evening to the guests,
                  was a venture bringing happiness, or misery to her.
               Quickly brushing away the obtruding tears, she looked up at her husband with a
                  smile—the deep little woman! and said gayly, "Dear old fellow! We shall have a
                  right pleasant evening, I'm sure!"
               
               He was very busy putting forgotten commas and dashes in his manuscript, and said
                  "yes" in an absent manner. Then he laughed over one of the pages, as if the joke
                  therein was good; and then be drew a long, doubtful sigh.
               "Hang it!" he said, "I'm afraid our readings will be a fac-simile of those of the
                  Historical Society. Did you order chocolate?"
               "Certainly, dear. But what is the connection between historical readings and
                  chocolate?"
               "Connection? Plenty!"
               "Plenty of reading or plenty of chocolate?"
               "Both; but the chocolate is to take the taste of the reading out of my mouth, as
                  the little boy said, when he rushed up, furiously to kiss his pretty cousin, to
                  take away the taste of the kiss his mother obliged him to give his grim
                  schoolma'am, to prove he was sorry for being naughty.
               "You see they invariably read some long-winded paper about a cracked old shaving
                  cup, or the like, which somebody has dug up, and swears it belonged to Gen.
                  Washington. Of course, the necessary development of this interesting fact,
                  requires a synopsis of the world from the beginning, for don't you see, if there
                  hadn't been any world, there indubitably dubitably would not have been any shaving
                  pot. This goes on snoringly for three quarters of an hour, when there comes a
                  mysterious odor of chocolate on, the blast. The orator sniffs, and incontinently
                  skips two pages, which, like the history of Sir Charles Grandison, does not
                  disturb the connection in the least; as you may go fast asleep while one of those
                  novels are being read, and wake up half an hour after, to find the company 'still
                  conversing in the red cedar parlor.'
               "But the delicious aroma becomes stronger. The audience is seized with scraping of
                  feet, violent coughing and wriggling in their seats; each member fastening one
                  wishful eye upon the door, the other blazing indignation at the speaker.
               "Then the orator pauses irresolutely; turns over several pages; wishes somebody
                  would blow the shaving cup sky high in a powder magazine to get rid of it; when
                  the president, who is famous for his suaviter in modo,
                     fortiter in re, comes gallantly and elegantly to the rescue, and in
                  that silvery, delightful voice, so full of courtesy and persuasion, observes that
                  'the intensely interesting paper before us, which will rescue from oblivion the
                  remarkable shaving cup whose history, enriched by profound political, metaphysical, and geological
                  speculations, beginning from the earliest ages, and investing the
                     very remarkable shaving cup with added grandeur, is necessarily of
                  a length which might very properly be divided into two readings; I therefore move,
                  [looking out of the corner of his eye at the orator, who winks approval]—I move
                  that the reading of this admirable paper be divided into two parts [sudden and
                  enthusiastic applause!]; and, as we seem to have come to—a—pause, I move that we
                  do now adjourn.' Seconded, amid tremendous applause, and in two minutes after
                  that, the thirsty; souls are following the scent with the precision of hunters.
                  The chocolate proves the reading to have been marvellously edifying, and everybody
                  goes away praising the very interesting paper."
               The little wife laughed heartily, and then scolded him well for making her laugh
                  at so dignified a subject and corporation,—when there came the first ring of the
                  bell, like the first gun at a battle.
               As a matter of course, she sprang to the mirror and smoothed down an imaginary
                  crimple in her satiny braids, and pulled a plait of her skirt one sixteenth part
                  of an inch the opposite way. One's toilet is never complete without that sort of
                  thing! Then she flew to Harry for a kiss, and got it; also, a look full of
                  tenderness and promise, and then the little coward awaited the first arrival with
                  outward confidence and inward trembling. Ah! the good people little knew what they
                  were helping to do. Helping to save her husband from that demoniac FIEND which has
                  caused more misery, disease, and crime, than plague, pestilence or famine. That
                  awful fiend, INTEMPERANCE! yet alas! there is scarcely a family but must shudder
                  and blush at the name! the ghastly skeleton letters of which stares at them from
                  their very hearthstones.
               Successive rings of the house bell, announced all the company. Courtesies
                  exchanged, I begged Harry to begin the reading. I saw the quivering lip of the
                  little wife, and well understood the nervous gayety of her manner. Harry, too,
                  felt twitchy, when he looked at her; and I heard him murmur, while, pretending to
                  arrange his manuscript, "Poor, little heart! so grieved!" and he bent his shapely
                  head and sighed remorsefully.
               But the company had settled themselves into listening attitudes; the one silent
                  expectant moment, which always occurs, had passed, and Harry began as follows:
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               LITTLE SISTER,
               
                  
                     
                        Or how a little woman, six years of age, was at the bottom of the
                           mischief
                     
                     AN O'ER TRUE TALE.
                  
               
               AT one of the windows of a certain house in Madison Square, one lovely afternoon
                  in June, sat a young lady of a most bewitching but mischievous aspect. The
                  splendors of an American sunset flooded earth and heaven; and the glowing,
                  changing tints were lingering so caressingly upon the creamy richness of the young
                  girl's complexion, and amid the lustrous blackness of her hair, that they invested
                  her for the nonce with a spiritual and dream-like beauty.
               But do not believe that the little dark-eyed witch deserved to be the idol of a
                  poet's dream. Not a bit of it. Though a very charming fairy, a more tormenting
                  sprite never plagued the heart of man; but by the blessed rule of compensation,
                  which sometimes obtains, even on this contumacious planet, I shall presently show
                  that she met with her deserts at the hands of another woman; albeit that other
                  woman was so aggravatingly young as to be beyond the pale of the law, as practised
                  by her sex; namely, retaliation in kind; for be it known, that ordinary shakings
                  and slappings, pinchings and pullings are of no avail in these cases; the victim
                  can only exhibit a dogged and exasperated resignation, and breathe an inward
                  prayer that these small brigands in petticoats may at some future time meet with
                  their most abundant reward.
               We left Tiny (for that was her pretty diminutive name) sitting at the window. In
                  her hand was a velvet slipper, which she was embroidering for "nobody,"
                     she said. Just at present the work was not progressing. She was
                  restless. If the door bell rang, the quick blood would rush to her cheeks, her
                  eyes, dilate, and her beautiful head would be poised in an eager, listening,
                  expectant (may I say?) stag-like attitude. With each disappointment the head would
                  droop, and a shadow pass over her sweet face. It was plain that somebody was
                  coming—ought to have come already—and would suffer when he (of course
                     "he") did come, for
                  keeping her waiting. Alas! poor fellow, I am affrighted for him.
               But at length an impetuous pull at the bell was heard. Then what happened? The
                  pretty head was gracefully inclined again, a sweet voice murmured "Dear, dear
                  Frank! come at last!" there was a fresh access of rich color to the cheek, a sigh
                  of relief, and a nervous trembling quickly suppressed by a will.
               Almost immediately, a tall, elegant young man rushed into the room. He was saluted
                  with a cool "What's the matter that you are in such a violent hurry? Has a powder
                  mill exploded next door?"
               "Oh Tiny!" he exclaimed, seizing her hand, regardless of her bantering, "I'm so
                  glad, so glad to be with you at last! how beautiful you look!" (Tiny made a face
                  at him.) "Don't do that! you are too enchanting already." (Tiny pouted.) "Oh good
                  gracious! don't pout with that rosebud of a mouth, or I shall—"
               But he didn't! for she snatched her hand away, and with blazing eyes ejaculated,
                  "Mr. Strange! behave!" and he behaved accordingly, and the kiss was
                  postponed. Tiny was—well—she was—slightly disappointed.
               "Will you not walk out with me as you promised, Tiny?" said Frank.
               "It is too late," she answered, "you were to have been here an hour ago;" and here
                  he received an angry eyebeam.
               "Don't look daggers! If you only knew what detained me! but I won't tell. I shall
                  only be laughed at, and I have had quite enough of that already, and all your
                  fault too!"
               "No, you don't say so! Ah now do tell me!" said the young girl coaxingly. "I
                  promise not to laugh. I'll be as grave as an owl, or the gravest of the judges
                  before whom you argue your cases. I'll look as solemn as Judge Betts, Judge
                  Clerke, and Judge Daly all put together! do, please, dear Frank."
               Those two last words were prostrating, as an inevitable matter of course; and he
                  began his confession in stuttering, stammering way, that caused Tiny's wicked
                  eye's to dance with delight; for she was certain something good was coming.
               "You must know, then," he began, "that I had a confounded declaration of breach of
                  contract to make out—over seventy pages; and the defendant's name occurred, as is
                  usual, about 999 times, and—and—instead
                  of declaring and stating and averring, as I ought, that the said defendant
                  'Smith,' promised and undertook and agreed and all the rest of it, and 'wilfully
                  refused and refrained from keeping his said promise, and undertaking, and
                  agreement'—why—I got thinking about you, you know, and how many times
                     you had broken your promises, and—in short" (here he
                  looked deprecatingly at her)— "now don't laugh, Smith was changed to 'Tiny'
                  wherever the name of that thief of a Smith ought to have occurred, until the whole
                  seventy pages were perfectly peppered with Tinies. Well, when, the counsel had
                  read a few lines, he rubbed his eyes and looked bewildered, the jury rubbed their
                  ears, and looked befogged, and the judge took off his spectacles and looked
                  indignant; while I, of course, was horrified, scarified, and petrified, and stood
                  staring at the counsel with my mouth open like a post office; my very soul was in
                  fits! Visions of lunatic asylums, schools in an uproar, camp meetings, and
                  earthquakes, rushed wildly through my brain; until a tremendous "WHAT DOES THIS
                  MEAN?" from the judge brought up my wandering thoughts with a jerk! and I
                  endeavored to explain that it was a most unaccountable mistake, a complete mystery
                  to me; but I suppose I blushed like a perfect fool;, my face was the
                  color of a stick of sealing wax or of official tape; and when the judge asked me
                  in a slow and frightfully distinct tone, 'Do—you—know—any—lady—whose Christian
                  name is Tiny?' I stammered out 'Y—e—s,' like such a donkey! and then
                  everybody roared, screamed, and yelled with laughter; and I ran as if a hundred
                  and fifty mad bulls were after me! Of course I had to copy the confounded document
                  over again, and I sat up all last night to do it."
               Do not think that Frank told all this without interruption; Tiny laughed till she
                  cried, and sooth to say Frank joined her; so upon the whole, our young lawyer felt
                  comforted that he had ventured the confession and, as his next question will show,
                  basely endeavored to make capital of the sufferings he had endured in behalf of
                  the lady of his love.
               "After all this, you will say you care a little for me, Tiny, will
                  you not? only a little for me."
               "No! indeed I will not! Care for you? not an atom!" And that was all the comfort
                  he got.
               "Ah Tiny, how can you say 'No' so savagely? It is cruel! when you are
                  perfectly well aware that I am exactly like Miles Standish—" and here he struck a mock-heroic attitude, and with
                  the approved pump-handle gesture recited: 
                     "I'm not afraid of bullets, or shot from the mouth of a cannon—But of a
                        thundering NO! point blank: from the mouth of a woman.'
                  
               
               "Your unkindness," he continued, "is really wearing me into holes; my heart
                  presents the appearance of a potato steamer, which is not a steamship, as perhaps
                  you may fancy; but a great tin pan full of great round holes; Berrian asks half a
                  dollar for them; I bought one for my mother to-day, and she said I gave sixpence
                  too much."
               "Make a 'merry Andrew,' as old Mrs. Gosling calls it," said Tiny, "in your
                  note-book; and charge it in your costs, in the next declaration you
                  make."
               "Declaration! My next declaration I make to you. Hear me, ye gods and
                  little fishes—I mean adorable Tiny, while I give utterance for the eighty-fifth
                  time, to my unutterable love. I love you to distraction—no lover ever loved,
                  might, could, would or should ever love as I love you; and yet this very week you
                  have made eight cruel speeches; they have all stabbed me to the heart, every one
                  of them mortal."
               "Poor fellow," laughed Tiny "killed eight times, and so very lively
                  notwithstanding; why are you like a cat?, because you have nine lives; you would
                  make eighty-one tailors; what a loss to the community. Now don't pull such a long
                  face; your chin is coming down all over your vest, and hiding the pattern. What is
                  the pattern? Looks like sharks running after small fry—very good pattern for a
                  lawyer; now don't look so dreadful. Start up, strike an attitude, and with your
                  hand on that normally wounded heart repeat after me, "Madam, since you are so
                  cruel and so cross, and so on, and so forth, say the word, and I shall be only
                  too, happy to die, sine die."
               What an incorrigible little woman! But her punishments was coming; for her little
                  sister, a child of six years, who had been listening to the conversation with
                  wide-awake ears, while apparently absorbed in running pins into the hapless brain
                  of a grimy-faced doll, to fasten her wig on more securely,—her little sister came
                  up to Frank, and drawing, his face down to hers, and putting her rosy lips close
                  to his ears, lisped out, before Tiny could prevent her:
               "Sister Tiny tell me she love you dearly; she did! there!" and then marched back in all the glow
                  of a meritorious action.
               Frank, went straight up to the seventh heaven! "Ah, now I've caught you," he
                  exclaimed, seizing the blushing girl's hands, and gently forcing her back on her
                  chair, "Don't run away! you are my prisoner now! you must, you
                     shall tell it to me yourself."
               Tiny resisted gallantly, protesting that it was all a mistake, and entreating him
                  to release her hand, and hold his tongue; she declared that little Kate had not
                  heard distinctly ("You imp of mischief!" this aside to Kate) it was of
                     somebody else site had spoken. (Oh what a terrible fib she told
                  then.)
               But Frank was not to be deceived; he only grasped her hands tighter, and she was
                  obliged to give up the vain endeavor, telling him half angrily that he was too
                  bad.
               I do not object to your declaring that I am 'too bad,' for I have lately heard
                  that when you ladies say we are 'too bad,' you mean, we are not bad enough."
               "Audacious," cried Tiny, snatching away her hands, "then I desire to assure you
                  that you are not too bad, but you are most particularly disagreeable, and I do
                  wish you would go and sit there!" pointing to the farthest corner of
                  the room.
               "Thank you. I will do precisely as you wish," returned the provoking
                  Frank, with a scarcely perceptible: accent on the last word; and he gently
                  insinuated himself upon part of her chair, and passed his arm round her waist.
               The now really indignant girl gave him such a look! She sprang from her chair,
                  while an angry, crimson flush rolled in quick tides over face and neck,
                  exclaiming, "I did not deserve this, Mr. Strange," and her large and
                  beautiful brown eyes were floated in tears.
               A woman's tears! and from beautiful eyes! Down on his knees went Frank, utterly
                  regardless of the damage done to the set of Derby's last brilliant effort in the
                  pantaloon line, and clamored out, "Oh! Tiny, forgive me! do forgive me! I'm a
                  wretch! I know I am! but I am charged up to the very muzzle, I mean to the very
                  end of my moustache, with remorse for my sins. Never, no never will I leave off
                  talking until I have your forgiveness! I've nearly sprained my tongue talking
                  already! Oh Tiny, you are the very pink and pattern tern of perfection, and I am one mass of crimes!
                  Don't laugh! Oh dear! All is over! I'll send back the lock of your hair in a
                  despairing cocked-hat note and the very edges of the paper shall be singed with my
                  wording burns, I mean burning burns! Pshaw! burning words! I don't know what I am
                  saying! but if you wish to avert insanity, you will forgive me
                  now."
               The "pink of perfection" listened to this torrent of eloquence with rather a
                  skeptical air; but after kissing little Kate (between you and me she was not
                     very angry with her), and telling her she was a very little woman
                  to be at the bottom of so much mischief, she informed Frank that he might consider
                  himself forgiven; and the lovers' incipient quarrel ended as lovers' quarrels
                  generally end. If you do not know how that is, don't imagine for a moment, that I
                  intend telling; only Tiny this time—well—she was not disappointed,
                  and Frank walked on air all the way home.
               You have found out, dear reader, with that extraordinary intelligence which
                     you only possess (as the lawyers always tell the jury), that Tiny
                  Stanley at seventeen, was a delightful mixture of seriousness and frolic, romantic
                  ideas and common sense. She and little Kate were the only surviving children of
                  Mr. Stanley, a merchant of considerable fortune; residing, as I have told you, on
                  Madison Square.
               Mr. Stanley was universally esteemed for his strict integrity in business and
                  loved for his kind heart; and was perfectly well known on 'Change as the obliging
                  old gentleman in an old coat and a queue. Brigadier-General Spisir, the
                  distinguished auctioneer, called him "Baked Pears", because his face was brown and
                  wrinkled; but he would not allow any one else to do so, as they were
                  old friends; and Mr. Stanley in return, called him "Baked Beans."
               There was a tearful romance connected with that queue, comical as it looked, for
                  the old gentleman would wear the old-fashioned high coat collar, and
                  of course, the queue stood up in the air like a signal. But, as I have said, there
                  was a tearful romance about that long hair, which, as I am just now in a trifling
                  humor, I shall not tell; suffice it to say that it was never to be cut, and he had
                  requested that it should be buried with him; and one of these days (a distant one,
                  I hope) you will see it, hike Washington Irving's Dutchman's queue, sticking out
                  of a hole in his coffin.
               
               The good man had a thorough contempt for speculating; nothing would have induced
                  him to take over seven per cent for his money. "Slow and sure" was his motto. He
                  met every misfortune, and inconvenience with the greatest coolness, or as, he
                  said, "like a philosopher;" was passionately fond of "Peregrine Pickle," "Gil
                  Blas," and "my Uncle Toby;" and as to Shakespeare, he knew him by heart, and,
                  quoted him on all occasions, right or wrong.
               Indeed, so great was his loving admiration for the written works of the wondrous
                  man whose name is for "all time," that he named his children after his favorite
                  characters. Thus the two surviving were called respectively "Titania," from
                  "Midsummer Night's Dream," and "Katharina," from "The Taming of the Shrew." But
                  the queenly appellation had been lovingly shortened to "Tiny," a name which seemed
                  made for the dear little witch, and Katharina was forgotten in "Kitty," or
                  "Kate."
               Mrs. Stanley was a marvellously pleasant, credulous, good-natured old lady, as one
                  might perceive by the absence of right angles in her face and person. If you had
                  been abroad you might convince her without much trouble that all other travellers'
                  stories were travellers' license, in which, like poets' license, there was more
                  imagination than fact; she would then believe, if you chose to tell her, that
                  Cleopatra's needle was the original sewing machine, and the Pyramids stood on
                  their points, which circumstance, and no other, made them a world's wonder. The
                  good old lady had extremely strict notions of propriety, and was rather too apt to
                  judge from appearances; indeed this last-mentioned trait almost amounted to a
                  fault. But notwithstanding these foibles, Mrs. Stanley was in most
                  things a very sensible woman, and preferred that her daughters' education should
                  be solid rather than accomplished; and as soon as Tiny had left school, she
                  proceeded at once to initiate the young lady into the unfashionable, mysteries of
                  brooms and baking.
               Her first pies made quite an era in the family history. She had achieved the
                  making and the baking so much to her satisfaction, that she insisted on one of
                  these wonderful pies being produced on the evening of the day of this remarkable
                  performance.
               Frank had come to tea; also two other young gentlemen, all hopelessly in love with
                  Tiny.
               "Are you the gentleman with the straw-colored hair and the hay-colored whiskers?" asked Kate in a
                  slow whisper of one of the lovers—a bashful man.
               The young noodle blushed painfully. "What makes your ears so red; have you painted
                  them?" continued the dreadful child. "What makes you stare so at that blue flower
                  in the carpet? sister Tiny said the other day you would wear the carpet into
                  holes."
               The victim gnashed his teeth, and said, "Ah! yes; did she? how very funny! ha! ha!
                  (then aside) I'll go; I won't be laughed at; I'll go home and shoot myself." But
                  he was a downy fellow, and in love, and so he stayed, and muttered under his
                  breath, "Ugh! you young griffin! why don't you go to bed?" Kitty did not go to
                  bed, but she moved off near Mr. Jones, the other lover, and sat twinkling her eyes
                  like an imp of supernatural intelligence, and looking alternately at her own
                  chubby legs and his.
               Alas! Frank had set her thinking about those legs; and upon that she spake,
                  holdings up her foot at him?, and (cunning thing) whispering:
               "See here, Mr. Jones, I say! I have not got legs like knitting
                  needles. Why do you have them?"
               The new victim started; a convulsive spasm seized his legs; he felt something like
                  the ringing or bells in his ears at this unexpected compliment, and had a
                  delirious idea of running some one through with a red-hot poker or a bayonet; but
                  neither instrument of vengeance being at hand, he bottled up his wrath, and walked
                  away to Tiny, who was talking and laughing with her mother and Frank, happily
                  unconscious of the latest exploits of this innocent cherub.
               But the wonderful pie was now put in great state and glory upon the table, and the
                  company gathered round. Tiny felt her plumes shaking when her father, after an
                  ineffectual attempt with a knife upon the crust, with portentous solemnity
                  requested that the hatchet might be brought from the lower regions.
               Oh what a pie was that! It was as tough as a law book, both inside and out; but in
                  spite of Tiny's entreaties (for little Kate had declared that her sister had said
                  she would never forgive them if they did not eat the whole of it), the lovers
                  despatched the pie to the last crumb, Making most incredible efforts to out-do,
                  and out-eat each other; consequently Frank was ill three days; Mr. Jones for a week, besides breaking a back
                  tooth; and the bashful man's life was despaired of for a fortnight. When at last
                  he became convalescent, he rushed without a scrap of courage, but a great deal of
                  desperation, into Tiny's presence, and insisted on her accepting him for the
                  "dangers he had passed."
               He married a widow twenty years older than himself, a month afterward; so I need
                  not mention the result of that interview.
               I am afraid the list of little Miss Tiny's accomplishments will disgust
                  fashionable Miss Flora McFlimsey, who lives on the other side of Madison
                  Square.
               She could not sing "Casta Diva" or "Ah, mon fils" in a way to make
                  the very hair of your head stand on end, to the utter confusion of time and tune,
                  which, like time and tide, wait or alter for no man. She could not sing them in
                  that way (which you all know is the most fashionable way) or any other; but she
                  could and did take sweet little bits of poetry from Tennyson, or Gerald Massey and
                  set them to music of her own composing, and sing them in a liquid voice, full of
                  delicious little trills and carols, enough to make a lark die of envy; and then
                  she played "the Lancers," and polkas, &c., and kept perfect time, which some
                  of my readers will admit is a rare accomplishment.
               She could dance without wings as lightly as a fairy with them; tell ghost stories
                  with startling effect; and wrote puzzles, parodies, and acrostics for all her
                  friends.
               If this were a story made of moonshine, I should describe Tiny, of course, as
                  ravishingly beautiful—and tell a fib—for she was no such thing. Her features,
                  though softly moulded, were not regular, but all the more piquant for that. Hers
                  was the beauty of an ever-varying expression, which, with a pair of large black
                  eyes—teeth whose whiteness and glitter were heightened in effect from the contrast
                  to her coral lips—clear brown skin and shining black hair, made her pass among
                  those who loved her, for her beauty. Besides, she was exactly five feet high, and
                  that, Frank maintained, was the only true standard.
               That gentleman of tormenting and repenting memory was an orphan; he had commenced
                  his existence, according to his own account, on the happy day when he first became
                  acquainted with Tiny, which was about a year before he was admitted to the bar. He
                  was very good looking, but so tall and
                  slender that one of his college chums thought he might answer on an emergency for
                  the mainmast of a revenue cutter, with close-reefed top-sails, as his ears were
                  particularly small.
               It was very fortunate that Frank had had two years' previous study, while yet an
                  unfledged lawyer in his years of indiscretion, for during his third and last year,
                  when he had become "Tiny's victim" (I use his own words), his time had been
                  principally occupied in staring at the outside of his books, writing love letters
                  to Tiny, and making sonnets on her soft eyes. He himself considered the profundity
                  of his love as quite unfathomable, and that nothing like it had ever been known
                  before. They were both very young and very happy, and scarcely looked beyond the
                  present. They were really engaged—and some time or other were to be married. But
                  Tiny was in no hurry for that; and often congratulated herself like a wicked,
                  cruel little woman as she was, that she had plenty of time to make him jealous,
                  and intended to tease him to her heart's content.
               It was perfectly surprising how Frank contrived to start up like a ghost, in the
                  most sudden and unexpected manner in the street any and every day, ten minutes
                  after Tiny had left the house. Probably he invested his loose cash in a two-legged
                  telegraph, who whistled her advent all the way down to his office.
               One pleasant Sunday morning he joined her as usual on her way to church. Little
                  Kate was with her. Frank had been lying in wait for some time, and as he came up
                  his face was radiant with pleasure.
               "Well, Frank," said Kitty, "your eyes are as big as carriage lamps! sister Tiny
                  was right."
               Frank's face fell to zero. "Did you say that, Miss Stanley?" he asked.
               "Oh! good gracious, no I didn't, yes, I did, but (oh! you goblin") pinching the
                  child; "but, that don't prevent your eyes being handsome," she said
                  with a sideways glance at his angry face; "dear Frank, I say such things
                  sometimes, you know, to hide how much I really—really—"
               "So she does," cried Kitty, "she hides things from me; she told the cook the other
                  day, not to say, 'Oh my stars and what's his names' before me. What
                     are 'what's his names,' Frank?"
               Frank laughed; Tiny said, "Oh! I shall never survive it! what a young one!" and
                  harmony was restored; but the young lady
                  was fearful of a relapse; so she said:
               "Now, Frank, I really think you had better not go to church with me this morning;
                  I have promised to sing with the choir up stairs; and if I leave you and Kitty
                  down stairs, something dreadful will be sure to happen."
               "Not at all," returned Frank. "I will prevent all that. How can you have any
                  apprehensions? when you know that I am universally spoken of as the wisest man,
                  next to Solomon. I found out the law of gravity before I was a year old, by
                  falling out of a second-story window, and I am in hourly expectation of
                  discovering the lever Archimedes wanted, when I shall immediately turn the world
                  topsy turvy. In the mean time eleven young ladies will die of disappointment, if I
                  don't make my appearance, especially as I have on this new and splendid vest. I
                  invented the pattern myself. What do you think of it?"
               "It's perfectly hideous," said Tiny, "I should think you might make money by
                  lending it out on hire to the people who dress up scarecrows."
               "No such thing," cried little Kate, "sister Tiny says you are beautiful, if you
                  only had a little more calf; what does that mean? I want to know;
                  say."
               "Oh what a story," said Tiny, blushing to the roots of her hair, and not daring to
                  look up or laugh. "You little pitcher! you magpie! your ears are prodigious! I
                  shall plan an excursion for you up the chimney the next time I wish to amuse
                  myself talking nonsense."
               While Kate was feeling her ears to ascertain the size, with a vague, distressful
                  look that made her companion laugh, in spite of Frank's being nettled at this last
                  brilliant sally—they arrived at the church, and with an earnest whispered
                  admonition to the little one to keep perfectly still, Tiny mounted to her musical
                  perch.
               In a few moments the pealing organ commenced a grand and solemn anthem, and Tiny's
                  clear and birdlike voice could be distinctly heard, harmoniously blending with the
                  deeper notes of the other singers.
               Then little Kate whispered to her companion, "Oh Frank! I hear sister Tiny! I hear
                  her singing."
               "So do I," answered Frank, "she sings like an angel, don't she, Kitty?"
               "No she don't; I don't like that long kind of singing; it's too slow. I wish she would sing
                  something else."
               "Perhaps you had better ask her," answered the thoughtless fellow.
               At this moment there was a pause in the music.
               Now or never, thought Kate, and to Frank's unspeakable consternation, that morsel
                  of a woman, jumped up on the seat, and lifting up her voice to its utmost
                  capacity, cried out, "Sister Tiny! SISTER TINY! see here! only sing 'Pop goes the
                  weasel,' and I'll be sattyfied."
               If a theatrical descent could Have been achieved through a trap door into a church
                  vault at that moment, Frank would gladly have disappeared, dragging his tormenting
                  demon with him.
               The sensation created was extraordinary; for the suppressed laughter sounded as if
                  a fresh wind had gotten into the church by mistake, and was to escape. One fat old
                  gentleman found the joke so dangerous that he grew perfectly black in the face,
                  and his family had to seize him by the shoulders and march him out in double-quick
                  time. If Kate was not sattyfied in one way, she certainly was in
                  another, for she was frightened out of her senses.
               On the same Sunday, in the evening, as the Stanleys were sitting at tea, the bell
                  rang; and as the door opened, Kate exclaimed, "Oh, sister Tiny! it's 'the
                  gentleman with the nose.'"
               This was one of Frank's careless speeches; fortunately only the family heard it,
                  and their guest attributed, their laughing faces to their delight in seeing him,
                  as he had lately returned from abroad.
               It was quite true that the worthy man rejoiced in a most prodigious Roman nose,
                  with a hump, like a camel's back in the very middle of it; but he was a very
                  pleasant, intelligent gentleman—and they were glad to see him.
               "You stayed so long in China," said Mr. Stanley, "that I thought you had been
                  created a Mandarin, with an embroidered yellow dress, red buttons, and three
                  tails. I suppose you talk nothing but Chinese."
               "As to that," he answered, "I did try to learn the language, especially after I
                  had made a hearty meal upon what I thought was 'chin-chin,
                  quack-quack,' but which the Cooley assured me was 'chin-chin, bow-wow,' but I can
                  only speak it in a broken sort of way."
               
               "Just think, Frank," laughed Tiny, "Mr. Moses talks 'broken China.'"
               "Yes," he continued, "and it will be reduced to atoms now that I am out of
                  practice; but I became quite expert at eating pickled sea slugs, bird's-nest soup,
                  and rice with chop sticks; the Chinese eat rice in this way so fast that it looks
                  like a snowstorm going backward."
               "Did you see any Chinese ladies with their tiny feet?" asked Tiny.
               "Of course," said Mr. Moses, "danced with dozens of them; they tottered about most
                  delightfully; I did not forget the Chinese feet at home, so I have brought you
                  several pairs of shoes; you need not go to your shoemaker for a year to come," and
                  he took from his pocket and presented to her two pairs of slippers, each about
                  three inches long.
               "Nonsense," said Tiny, laughing and blushing, but nevertheless very much
                  delighted, for her feet were very small, and she knew it; while Frank loudly
                  bemoaned the present fashion of long skirts, which hid those tiny feet.
               "I do declare," he grumbled, "the women might as well have claws like a griffin,
                  and I dare say the woman who invented long dresses did have claws; or
                  else I am certain that her pedimental supporters, ended in a sharp point, like a
                  mark of admiration, the exhibition of which, to say the least, would be decidedly
                  unpleasant. There's Tiny's feet now—put out your feet, Tiny" (she did so
                  demurely), "A model for a sculptor" (Tiny twitched them in)—"Dear me! don't do
                  that, I was just going to make a conundrum on them."
               "Never mind, Frank," said little Kate, in a kindly tone, "if she won't let you see
                  her feet, you're to have a present. I heard her say the other day for fear you
                  might go raging mad about her feet, she meant to go to Brady's and have a
                  footograph likeness taken of them."
               A roar of laughter followed this revelation, to Tiny's unutterable confusion,
                  which was not at all lessened, when her mother folded her hands meekly over her
                  ample bosom, and slowly ejaculated:
               "I hope, I do hope, my dear, you have not been to Brady's; how very
                  improper! Footograph? I have not heard of that before you must be mistaken and
                  mean photograph, my dear; and you know that photographs are for
                     faces, not feet."
               The laugh increased at this, and Frank, with a comical absence of tact said, "That
                  reminds me of our friend Mrs. Gosling.
                  She asked me if I had ever heard of Madame Vestris; and upon assuring her that I
                  had, and that my very whiskers curled with admiration at the mention of her name,
                  she kindly informed me that Madame Vestris had very beautiful limbs, 'which I did
                  not know, perhaps,' she said; and 'perhaps not,' I said.
               "'They were so beautiful, Mr. Strange, that all the sculptors took
                     busts of them, you know; and 'when an execution was put into her
                  house, you know, the busts of her legs sold for more than all the rest of the
                  furniture, you know.'"
               While Frank was relating this ridiculous story, Kate was pertinaciously staring at
                  Mr. Moses. It was very evident that some knotty point was developing in her busy
                  little brain. She had been piously taught by her mother, and she now determined to
                  prove, if possible, the truth of one of her lessons. Slipping softly down from her
                  chair, she walked round to where the guest was sitting; and resting her little
                  hands on his knees, and looking up in his face with an ineffable air (the little
                  monster) of innocence and candor, lisped out, "Mr. Moses—say—Mr. Moses—Are you the
                  Mr. Moses that was found in the bulrushes? Are you? say!!!"
               An awful silence succeeded this speech for one moment; then every one thought it
                  best to laugh, and Mr. Moses told "l'enfant terrible" that it was his grandfather
                  who was ventilated in the bulrushes; but he soon took his leave, bending his head
                  over Tiny's hand, and touching it with his lips; a foreign fashion, which
                     Frank thought highly unnecessary. Tiny blushed and looked at her
                  hand, and behold! on the back thereof was a faint portrait of a moustache! Frank
                  saw it, too, and whispered in her ear "Never say dye." That terrible child heard
                  him; and out she ran to ask Mr. Moses "why he blacked up her sister's hand," and
                  why Frank said "Never say die." Tiny gave her a private shaking, and I may as well
                  mention here, that he never came again.
               Oh dear! she was so provoked! but what good did it do? I ask emphatically, did it
                  do any good?
               "Mamma," suddenly exclaimed Tiny, a few days after; "Mamma, I want to ask you a
                  question. You know Frank and I were at Annie Dayton's last evening; suppose we had
                  in jest repeated the marriage service before her father, would it be a legal
                  marriage?"
               "Certainly," said her mother, looking over her spectacles at her daughter, "certainly; why do you
                  ask?"
               "Oh nothing," laughed Tiny, and she left the room, saying she must go and
                  superintend some preparations that were making for the entertainment of a few
                  friends whom she had invited to spend the evening with her.
               "Well now, what a queer question," ejaculated the old lady to herself; "what could
                  have put it into Tiny's head?" Mrs. Stanley had laid violent hold of an idea. She
                  shook her head, and murmured, "I must keep my spectacles on and my ears open, and
                  try to find out whether Tiny means anything."
               Just at this moment the cook, with a very red and angry face, came hastily into
                  the room; and said in a loud, provoked voice: 
               "I wishes to give you warning though, ma'am; as there is ten days of my month
                  left, I hopes its ampial."
               "Why, what is the matter?" said her mistress.
               "I can't abear to be suspicioned, though, ma'am; and Miss Kate says that I'll be
                  caught if I touch the brandy, as her pa has made a mark on the bottle. I never
                  took no brandy, though, ma'am; Miss Kitty says I smells of brandy; I leaves it to
                  any American Judy if I does. There's not a many as'll bile a ham for you as I
                  does; just keep it simpering and simpering, and never biling hard; nor yet be so
                  forkanate in briling as I be; and I don't see (and here she began to wail loudly)
                  why Miss Tiny should say, as Miss Kate tells me, that my third cousin Teddy, was
                  the 'living skeleton,' 'and came here for a dinner,' I don't, though! and I gives
                  you ampial warning ma'am—' and she flounced out of the room sniffling with another
                  reference to an American Judy—meaning, it is supposed, the bulwarks of our
                  national liberties.
               "Oh me! Kate, what am I to do with you?" said the old lady, in a
                  helpless way.
               "Don't worry about me, mamma," said Kate, affectionately; "I'm all
                  right; sit down, do; and I will tell you a most beautiful story Frank told me last
                  night, to keep me from 'setting any more people by the ears;' what did he mean by
                  that? I didn't touch any ears at all; I only said to Mr. Waddle, 'Mr. Waddle
                     who will set the North River on fire? Sister Tiny says
                     'you never will.' But never mind, mamma, I'll tell you this
                     story;" and she smoothed down her
                  dress, and taking a long breath, began—
               "Once upon a time—but what is that upon the carpet?" said Kate, interrupting
                  herself and running to pick it up. "A note! and the very one sister Tiny got this
                  morning, and kissed so; the idea of kissing a piece of paper! tell me the reading
                  in it, mamma."
               (Ah Tiny! you careless little gipsy! why, oh! why did not your ears burn, or your
                  thumbs prick, when there was so much mischief in the wind.)
               The note was open, and Mrs. Stanley glanced at the beginning. What? she rubbed her
                  spectacles, and looked again; "Dearest little wife," and the old lady
                  stood confounded, not to say petrified.
               "Dearest little wife"—could it be that her own darling, her Tiny, who despised
                  deceit and concealment, had indeed been so foolish as to have been married the
                  previous evening? much as she knew they both loved a joke, she thought this was
                  carrying a joke a little too far.
               But then, there was her strange question that very morning, and there was the
                  tell-tale letter, which Kate was clamoring to hear; and Mrs. Stanley, in her
                  anxiety to learn more, did, I am obliged to say, rather an unfair thing—she read
                  the note.
               It was full of more than the usual quantity of never-ending devotion,
                  never-failing constancy, and never-dying love, and was signed your "Adoring
                  husband, Frank." Date that morning.
               "Alas! deary me!" sighed the old lady; "here is a pretty piece of business; but I
                  will act deliberately," she continued, folding up the note. "I will say nothing,
                  but will watch Frank and Tiny closely this evening, and then decide what course to
                  pursue."
               It was a soft summer night; hushed, and beautifully clear. The full-orbed moon in
                  regal splendor proudly sailed in the zenith, and the idle zephyrs floating through
                  the square just lifted with their dainty breath the ringlets of the merry girls as
                  they hastened across with their attendant cavaliers, to spend the evening with
                  their favorite friend.
               Tiny welcomed them heartily; and Frank said, "I'm so glad you've come," for Tiny
                  objects to the epitaph I have been composing for my tombstone, and I leave it to
                  you, if it is not the most telling thing out."
               
               "Tombstone!" they all exclaimed, in considerable consternation "what an idea! you
                  don't think of dying, do you? Impossible! how very ridiculous!"
               "Ridiculous? it will be splendid! you are miles out of your reckoning. Just
                  listen! I intend to have on my tombstone these words: 'Here lies an HONEST
                  lawyer,'—'honest' in very large capitals."
               "How is any one to know that it is you, Strange?" said Annie Dayton.
               "How will they know?" answered Frank, facing round upon her, "by minding the
                     emphasis, to be sure. Every man, woman and child will stop
                  short,—look again, and repeat aloud: 'What? Here lies an HONEST lawyer?' and
                  immediately add, 'that's strange.' Me, of course! and my
                  name, covered with glory as the only honest lawyer extant, will be
                  handed down along with Shakespeare and Mother Goose to the remotest posterity.
                  What's in a name? Everything! Wait until I write my
                  commentary on Shakespeare; the whole world will be staggered; my first and
                  fiercest onslaught will be upon that unlucky speech of Juliet's for whom, with
                  that exception, I have the most transcendent admiration."
               At this moment a very handsome young man came up to Tiny, and bowing stiffly,
                  said—
               "I must wish you good evening, Miss Stanley."
               "Why, I'm very sorry to hear you say so, Mr. Bailey," answered Tiny, in some
                  surprise. "What has happened?"
               "Oh nothing, nothing at all; you're very delightful, good evening;" "stupid! heavy
                  dragoons!" he muttered, going out, "confound the whole family especially that
                  cherub. As she has no wings of her own, it's a pity somebody else couldn't fly
                  away with her." (I wonder if he meant the d——l.)
               "What could have happened," cried Tiny, looking very much
                  annoyed.
               "Now don't pretend you're sorry, sister Tiny," said Kitty, "you know what you and
                  Frank said, and I just told it to him, to make him feel comfortable."
               Poor Tiny! with crimson cheeks, and lips trembling with anger, she said, "What did
                  you tell him, you—you—"
               "Just what you said; I said, 'Mr. Bailey, sister Tiny said you were very handsome, and so very
                  genteel; but it's a pity you are so stupid; and then Frank said 'Yea, verily! he
                  belongs to the heavy dragoons.'"
               "That child kills me," cried Tiny; and she was rushing in the midst of the
                  repeated bursts of laughter to her mother, to beg that Kate might be immediately
                  put to bed, when Frank begged her not to punish the poor little unconscious
                  mischief maker, saying, "After all, it is our own fault, Tiny, we must learn to
                  abuse our friends in the dead languages before the monkey; she has just promised
                  to go peaceably to bed, herself if I will tell her a story."
               "Yes Frank, I will; come, a nice story now; very long, and all about people that I
                  know! make haste! begin!"
               "Oh certainly," said Frank. Kate planted herself upon his knee, her eyes nearly
                  starting out of her head with her anxiety not to lose a word, and her head so much
                  on one side, that comparisons with a magpie were inevitable. You may be sure that
                  the forthcoming story would be packed away, for the future confusing and
                  confounding of the unlucky narrator.
               "What shall I tell you? Did you ever hear of the siege of Troy?"
               "Oh! I've been there," said Kate. "It's up the North River; and papa
                  says they ask a most abominable price to go thereby the railroad."
               "The very place," continued Frank. "Well, not long ago there lived across the way
                  a king, called Menelaus; whether because be made our ridiculous quantity of
                  ridiculous laws or not, I can't say. He was rather a nice old cove, and his life
                  and death were just the reverse of that of most children's heroes, for they
                  generally live in peace and die in grease, whereas he lived in Greece
                  and died in peace. Being a man of arms, he took to his arms a young woman called
                  Helen, who had more beauty than brains, and who treated him to a curtain lecture
                  every night, and scratched his face because she wanted to go to Paris.
               "I know!" interrupted Kitty eagerly; "Paris is the catipal of
                  France."
               "Not exactly," answered Frank. "This was Paris of Troy, a tremendous dandy. He was
                  the son of a fine old fellow named Priam, who was governor of Troy, and whose
                  very, airy attire consisted of a long white nightgown, and no boots. He, in his turn, was ruled by his wife, and left
                  a long and brilliant line of posterity, terminating in that genial, excellent and
                  talented man, the Rev. Dr. Irenius Priam, the editor of the 'New York Deserver!'
                  while the old king himself had a genealogical tree taller than Adam's, if you can
                  believe (as of course you must) that learned antiquarian and poet Campbell, who
                  wrote 'The last Man,' and who knew perfectly well what, he was about, when he said
                  or sung: 
                     
                        "'I saw the last of human mould
                        That shall creation's death behold,
                        
                           As Adam saw his Priam.'
                     
                  
               
               "Well, as Helen could not go to Paris, Paris came to call upon her, and invited
                  her to take a trip to Troy; and was so very uncivil as not to include old Poppy
                  Menelaus in the invitation. He told her it was only a step; so she took it, and a
                  very false step it proved; for though he called immediately for his
                     galley and rowed away, another precious row came of it. For
                  Menelaus instantly made up a select party to go to Troy too, and invited all, the
                  kings of his acquaintance to accompany him. One of these kings was from the Yankee
                  land of ancient times, and was called Ulysses, an amazing cute chap, up to all
                  sorts of dodges, wooden nutmegs, shoepeg melon seeds, and painted pine knives.
                  Another was a Turk and an Aga, Aga Memnon was his name. Another was such a
                  dreadful fellow for fighting, that his admirers though they could not flatter him
                  more than to cry out 'Oh kill us!' whereupon he obtained, the name of Achilles.
                  His nephew lives in this very city, and is one of the firm of 'Victor and
                  Achilles,' importers of stockings in Duane street; and will sell you as many
                  stockings as you want. The more you buy the better he'll be pleased; for you see,
                  he went into that business of covering for the feet, because his poor dear uncle
                  lost his life on account of one end of his foot being uncovered as you shall
                  presently hear.
               "Well, off all these fellows went to Troy; and having arrived, the Trojans were so
                  rude as to slam the door in their faces; so they sat down before the walls, and
                  began to scold the inhabitants and storm the city. But though the Trojans would
                  not let them in, they were fools enough every few days to let themselves out and
                  engage in various bloody single combats, with double-edged swords, and presented,
                  Menelaus and the rest with a great many
                  pointed arguments, in the shape of spears and arrows, to induce them to go away.
                  They kept up this fun for ten years; but still their enemies stuck closer than a
                  brother, and poor old Menelaus kept bachelor's hall, and had to cook his own pork
                  and beans, and pumpkin pie.
               "At last one day Achilles had a little set-to with a hectoring fellow named
                  Hector, another son of our old friend Priam; which resulted in mischief to Hector,
                  for Achilles made him see ten thousand stars the first moment, and nothing at all
                  the second; after which the poor fellow, screaming out, 'Och hone! I'm kilt
                  intirely,' bit the dust; and then Achilles took him on a little tour round the
                  city; and as there was only one seat in his chariot, he thought the best way to
                  accommodate Hector, was to let him ride behind; and for fear he might lose his
                  company, he just tied him by the heels, and started, while his papa Priam stood on
                  the walls, and laid the dust with his tears, and damaged that old white nightgown
                  in the most appalling manner."
               "No! did he?" cried Kitty; "who mended it for him? did he tear those dreadful
                  five-cornered holes, which I tear in my frocks, and which old Aunt Betsey gets so
                  cross over? say!"
               "Yes, and his old aunt Betsey said it was a perfect object to behold,
                  and only fit for the ragbag, or a paper manufactory.
               "And now let me tell you what happened to Achilles. His mother was a particular
                  friend of Pluto; who was the major of the unmentionable-to-ears-polite place; and
                  he allowed her to dip Achilles in the Styx."
               "Dry sticks?" asked Kitty.
               "No, wet. It had the power of making its bathers invulnerable; but not being a
                  Yankee, she was not smart enough to think of pitching him in, and diving after
                  him, but held him by the heel; and gave him such a deliberate dip, that his heel
                  was not touched by the water; and there was just where Paris had him;
                  and there he shot him, just as he was executing a war-dance to
                  celebrate the death of Hector, and was standing on the tip of one toe, and
                  pointing and shaking the other at Paris, after the fashion which the boys call
                  'taking a sight.' Paris shot him in the heel, and he'll never dance again; and if
                  you are sorry for him, you will buy all your stockings of his nephew in Duane
                  street, opposite the hospital.
               "This was a horrible blow to the Greeks as well as Achilles; and they concluded to pack up and be
                  off, with a 'Bob-swore,' as the Englishman said for 'Good night,' and thought it
                  was French; but that regular Yankee, Ulysses, sang them a song of Christy's
                  Minstrels, the moral of which was that 'it would neber do to gib it up so.' He
                  then set them all to work at a wooden horse, which he said the Trojans would be
                  asses enough to believe in, such a world of gammon and spinage as it was! and
                  having stuffed his horse with warriors instead of wool, he sent it as a pretty
                  little present: to the Trojans; and then the rest said 'Bob-swore,' and got into
                  their galleys. But they only rowed a little way and hid behind the corner.
               "And now, spite of the entreaties of a cunning old coon, named Laöcoon, and the
                  prophecies of a lady called Cassandra—"
               "Now stop, and tell me," cried Kate, "was she any relation to General Cass? Was
                  she?"
               "His great grandmother, she was, and was generally thought to be
                  cracked in the upper story. Well, in spite of their entreaties, the Trojans took
                  in the horse and—the Greeks took in the Trojans. For when night came stealing on,
                  the Greeks marched out of the horse; and running to the gates, unlocked them, and
                  all their friends and comrades came tumbling in, armed at all points, with grizzly
                  war depicted in every feature, each with a quid of tobacco in his left cheek, and
                  jack-boots under his arms.
               "And now, all was catastrophe and confusion, hurrying and scurrying, slashing and
                  screaming, and firing and fighting; and then some impertinent little son of a
                  Dutchman pulled Priam out of bed in that same tattered old white nightgown; and to
                  make a long story short the Greeks carried the day—or the night—and Troy was no
                  more: or as Virgil said, 'Illium fuit,' which
                  means "Troy was," which you know is a fib, for you say it is highland
                  dry up the North River at this very moment."
               "Now thank you, Frank," said Kate, "for that real true story; papa knows Mr.
                  Achilles, and mamma knows Mr. Priam; and I do hope they will come here soon, so I
                  can ask them to tell me more about, their relations."
               "You'll suffer for this story," said Tiny, laughing, and she ran off to propose
                  dancing to her young friends. Her eyes were wildly bright this evening; and she
                  felt in what are called "tearing spirits, and her lively sallies, comical
                  speeches, and musical laughter had such a
                  catching effect on the little party, that every one was in the most delightful
                  humor with themselves and each other.
               I don't know, but I suspect that a prettily fancied ring, that sparkled for the
                  first time on one of Tiny's little fingers, had something to do with her charming
                  spirits; certain it is, that the occasional batteries of glances between Frank and
                  herself were all noticed by her mother, and gave her unspeakable uneasiness.
               "Ah! I'm afraid it must be so," she sighed.
               "They are all trying to persuade your father to dance," said Annie Dayton to
                  Tiny.
               "Are they?" she cried; "what fun! I'll go and add my entreaties; he'll dance for
                     me;" and running up to Mr. Stanley, she begged him to delight them
                  all; "Now do dance papa, just for fun, you know."
               "And for Tiny's sake," chimed in Frank.
               "Now what a crazy little chatterbox it is," cried Mr. Stanley "to ask your old
                  father to dance 'for fun,' at this time of life;" and he gave her a passage from
                  Shakespeare, which plainly demonstrated that dancing was out of the question for
                  an old gentleman with a queue.
               "Not at all! you have not read my copy of Shakespeare; this is what
                  he says"—and with a high tragedy "stride and a stop," she saluted him with— 
                     
                        "'Rise! Father rise! Titania demands your help.
                        Rise! That's a clever dear old gentleman,
                        And share our fun.'"
                     
                  
               
               The parody carried the day; and laughing heartily, Mr. Stanley suffered himself to
                  be led in triumph to the head of the set then forming; while his delighted
                  daughter, taking off her rings which knocked against the keys of the piano, began
                  to play; and her father flourished and figured away, in the very best style of the
                  old school; good naturedly joining in the merriment, and recommending his partner
                  to keep out of the circumference of his pigeon wings and entrechats.
               While Tiny was playing; little Kate picked up one of the rings, lying on the
                  piano, and going to her mother, said—
               "Mamma look! look! why don't you look? here is sister Tiny's pretty new ring tell
                  me the reading in it, do? won't you? say, won't you?
               Mrs. Stanley took the ring; and looking sharply through her spectacles, discovered
                  to her astonishment ment the words "My little Wife," very prettily engraved on the inside. Alas! and
                  alack! here, was "confirmation strong as holy writ;" and the good lady's
                  countenance assumed such a blank, helpless expression, that Kitty asked her "what
                  made her look so silly."
               "Well!" gasped Mrs. Stanley at last, "This is conclusive! It is dreadful! I must
                  do something, and I will!" and frightened nearly out of her wits and
                  quite out of her common sense, she hastily left the room; and writing a note to
                  the Rev. Mr. Dayton, who lived only a few doors from them, required his immediate
                  attendance. She despatched it by a servant; and then returned to the parlor in a
                  state of terrible trepidation, to await his coming.
               Finding, when she entered the room, that the quadrilles were over, the young
                  people engaged dancing a polka, and her husband at liberty, she drew him aside;
                  took off her spectacles, and put them on again four several times; then she took
                  out her pocket handkerchief and sat down upon a gentleman's hat, and converted it
                  into an opera hat; then in a voice of the deepest emotion, she said—
               "My dear, I am in the greatest distress. If we had been two hard-hearted
                  rhinoceroses!—"
               "Rhinoceros! what do you mean, my dear?"
               "Well, I'm going to tell you," said. the poor old lady.
               "Then stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once."
               "Yes, my dear, I'm going. Frank and Tiny were privately married at Mr. Dayton's
                  last evening."
               "No!" said Mr. Stanley.
               "Yes," said Mrs. Stanley.
               "No! I say;" said Mr. Stanley.
               "I say yes;" said Mrs. Stanley.
               "No! No! by Jupiter I swear no;" said Mr. Stanley.
               "I won't swear, but; they did;" persisted Mrs. Stanley; "and rather than Tiny's
                  reputation should suffer from the strange reports that may get about, I have just
                  sent for Mr. Dayton, and as soon as he comes I shall request him to marry them
                  over again; I shall never be happy nor satisfied until I have myself witnesses
                  that they are made husband and wife."
               For the first time in his life on record, Mr. Stanley's astonishment exceeded his
                  coolness.
               "Bless me!" he cried, "Upon my honor! By
                  George! who would have believed in the proximity of such a remarkable crisis. But
                  are you quite certain of your facts?"
               "Unfortunately, I have too many proofs;" answered his wife; and she related to him
                  the discoveries of the day, adding—"Poor little Kate, with all her mischief, has
                  done good service in this unhappy state of affairs; for she brought
                  the note to me, she showed me the ring."
               "Ah the ring! yes! the ring is indeed very conclusive. 'Here, take my ring, my
                  house, mine honor, yea, my life be thine.' I did think my little
                  sunbeam had more sense;" sighed the old gentleman; but he comforted himself with
                  the reflection that clandestine marriages must have happened among the ancients;
                  and certainly did in Shakespeare's time; and having just quoted, "All's well that
                  ends well," he ended with a whole page of "Romeo and Juliet."
               "May I have the particularly particular honor of waltzing with you?" said Frank,
                  addressing his lady love, who had vacated her seat at the piano to one of her
                  friends.
               "With the most reluctant reluctance," she replied, giving him a sunny smile; and
                  putting on her rings, she discovered that her "last best gift," the opal with the
                  little diamonds sparkling round it, was missing; looking down she saw it hanging
                  loosely from one of Kitty's chubby fingers.
               "Oh you little scaramouch;" she cried "how could you meddle with your sister's
                  rings? Give it to me. Did you show it to any one?"
               "Oh no, nobody; only just mamma;" said the child.
               "You quintessence of mischief!" cried her sister; "you ought to be kept in a glass
                  case, hermetically sealed! What a little get-me-in-a-scrape it is!" and very much
                  provoked, Tiny drew on her gloves, wondering if her mother had seen the inside of
                  the ring, and if she had, what she thought of it.
               At this moment Mr. Dayton, the minister, entered the room. He looked round, not a
                  little surprised to see so many there, and entirely thrown out of his conjecture
                  that sudden sickness in the family had occasioned his being called; and Frank and
                  Tiny were far more surprised when Mrs. Stanley called them to come to her, in a
                  tone that attracted the attention of all in the room.
               "Tiny," began her mother, in a hurt and trembling voice. "I must say that I am
                  grieved beyond expression, and also
                  deeply offended with your very foolish conduct of last evening. I did
                  think that I had instilled such, a strong sense of propriety in your mind, as to
                  have prevented your acceding to any persuasions of Frank's which you knew would
                  not meet with your parents' approbation. Don't attempt any excuse," she continued,
                  seeing that both, with bewildered looks at each other and her, were trying to
                  speak. "I won't hear a word! not a single word!" and turning to the worthy pastor,
                  requested him to marry them again, with a reproachful accent upon the
                  last word, which was utterly lost on the worthy and unconscious minister.
               I wish I could paint with my pen the faces of the company during this
                  harangue.
               But adequate description is impossible. I can only say that there was a room full
                  of very open countenances, as, with distended eyes and lips wide apart, they
                  witnessed these strange proceedings; while in utter bewilderment, almost dismay,
                  the young couple stood up, and the ceremony commenced, * * * * * * * * * The
                  reader is requested to stare at these asterisks till he supposes it concluded.
               When they were fairly united and the benediction tion pronounced, Mrs. Stanley
                  uttered a long-drawn sigh; and looking greatly relieved, though still tremulous
                  and twitchy, she addressed the young husband thus—
               "As I have most fortunately been enabled to make things right, you may inform me
                  now, Frank, what possessed you and Tiny to induce Mr. Dayton to marry you last
                  evening?"
               "Ma'am!!!!" stammered Frank.
               "Madam!!!!" exclaimed the minister.
               "Why—were—you—married—last—evening?" repeated Mrs. Stanley, stiffening up, grimly
                  frowning, and looking majestically over her spectacles.
               "Ma'am!" repeated Frank again, "I—you—I—why, my dear madam, you must be dreaming!
                  I am utterly at a loss to comprehend why you have married us this
                  evening! and I do most; solemnly assure you that this is the very first time I
                  have ever repeated the words of the service with this my dear little wife"
               "Why Tiny! why TITANIA!" said her mother, looking somewhat less majestic, but
                  still very much bolstered up. "Do you remember the question you asked me
                     this morning?" (the emphasis on every word was as pointed as
                  needles.)
               
               It was now Tiny's turn to stammer; but there was an undoubted expression of truth
                  on her sweet face, as she said, "Oh mamma! how could you! Frank and I, called at
                  Annie Dayton's last evening; and Frank, to plague me (he's always plaguing me,
                  good-for-nothing Blue Beard!) proposed that we should repeat the marriage service
                  before Mr. Dayton's portrait, that hung in the room; that it would be capital fun,
                  and make us perfect in our parts; and that everybody had a rehearsal before the
                  real ceremony came off, and ever so much more. But," earnestly added the,
                  trembling and blushing girl, with her eyes which were now brimming with tears
                  fixed on her mother's face, "I did not do it, indeed, mamma, for I
                  was afraid it was not right; and Annie said that she would be a witness, which
                  would constitute a Scotch marriage, and that she believed would make it legal. So
                  I was thinking it all over this morning, and I asked you the question to satisfy
                  myself entirely."
               "But—but, my dear, Kate brought me a letter this morning," said Mrs. Stanley with
                  a grievous expression, but collecting all her forces with adamantine
                  sternness.
               "Oh dear mother! stop! do stop!" interrupted Tiny. Her cheeks out-damasked the
                  rose; and her beautiful eyes fell under their long lashes, as she explained that
                  Frank had sent her that letter that very morning, he said "on approbation," as the
                  dry good clerks call it, as a slight specimen of the style of, epistle he intended
                  to write to her after they were married.
               The old lady's foundations were tottering, and her breath became short. "The ring!
                  the ring! the opal ring!" she gasped, driven to her last and convincing proof.
               Another and another tide of crimson overspread Tiny's face and neck; and Frank
                  came to the rescue by saying that be had bought the ring, and had "my little wife"
                  engraved in it, to keep himself as something to look at, and prevent him from
                  becoming impatient until the happy time arrived, when his little Tiny might wear
                  it. He had only brought it that evening to see if it fitted; and the little soft
                  hand looked so fascinating, ornamented with the delicate jewel, that he had
                  entreated her to wear it for the evening, and give it back to him when he
                  left.
               And the mysteries were all explained! and unlike the "baseless fabric of a vision,
                     had left a
                  wretch (as Frank quoted it) behind;" and that wretch was Kitty, who
                  was sniffling behind the door, rubbing her nose up, as children invariably do,
                  with four inches square of hem-stitched pocket handkerchief; also there was
                  displayed to view an old and most respectable lady, who had been particularly
                  engaged, in judging and acting from appearances. Her countenance at
                  the final denouement, presented such a droll
                  distress, such a comical medley of expression that it was utterly irresistible in
                  its actual effect; for the company, after pausing one well-bred instant, in a vain
                  endeavor to maintain their gravity, burst into a simultaneous explosion, or as
                  Frank said, "went off into fits" of uncontrollable laughter, minister and all; and
                  for five minutes the apartment resounded with merriment, until it would seem that
                  the very walls were cracking, and the roof in danger.
               "Well," said Mr. Stanley, after the mirth had subsided a little, and the company
                  were beginning to reflect that they ought not to have laughed. "Well, it is my
                  deliberate opinion that we have been marrying my little Tiny on a speculation,
                  instead of a certainty, and no fault, of hers either" (with a sly glance at his
                  wife). "But where's Kitty? come out, Kitty, never mind;" dragging that terrible
                  child from her ambush behind the door, with her finger in her mouth; her face
                  swollen with crying, and her poor little nose turned up a surprising height in the
                  air, by the unceasing rubbing mentioned above. It was plain that she was in
                  infinite terror; and supposed that all the company had pronounced sentence upon
                  her as a murderer or something worse; and she was there and then to be taken out
                  and instantly executed; but her father kissed her, and said, "Never mind, Kitty;
                  don't cry any more. 'All's well that ends well;' we will give the young couple a
                  hearty blessing; and I will look at my bonds and mortgages, and see what I can do
                  for them."
               
               Six months passed away. It was a stormy night in December. The wind rushed past
                  with a wild moaning sound; and the sharp, frozen rain pattered against the windows
                  of a small but pretty house in Lexington avenue. But the fire blazed cheerily in
                  the little front parlor and with the softened light shining through the thick
                  white shade over the gas-burner, gave a refined, delicious air of comfort to the
                  room, which was greatly heightened by the contrast to the audible dreariness
                  without.
               
               A young gentleman, tall and slender enough for "the mainmast of a revenue cutter"
                  was sitting by a pretty centre table, intently occupied in studying and making
                  notes, from a ponderous volume which lay open before him.
               Nearer the fire sat a lady; her little figure nearly buried in an immense arm
                  chair, large enough for two, busily plying her needle, and ever and anon casting a
                  loving glance at the student.
               Dear reader do you know them? After all, perhaps, Mrs. Stanley's mistake had been
                  the very best thing in the world she could have done for Frank; for, stimulated by
                  the necessity for greater exertion, talents, of whose existence he had been
                  scarcely aware, were brought into active play; and the result was that his little
                  wife and himself had commenced housekeeping in a very pretty style, and were just
                  as happy as two contented laughter-loving and, each-other-loving bodies could
                  possibly be. Not an inch of tape did they care now for Kate's speeches; though
                  they were as ever of the most tremendous description—and as to Tiny's pies!—they
                  fairly melted in your mouth.
               Frank continued reading on the above-mentioned evening for ten minutes longer;
                  when, raising
                  
                     "Will you tell me now that you love me, Tiny, my little
                        wife?"—p.93
                   ing himself to turn over a leaf, his attention was attracted by the
                  glittering whisk of something to-and-fro in the air—and his eye rested on an opal
                  ring set with small diamonds sparkling on one of his wife's pretty fingers. It
                  must at that moment have been a talisman or magnet; for the book was shut with a
                  bang! and rising from the table, he approached Tiny, "gently
                  insinuated himself on part of her chair, and passed his arm round her waist."
               "Will you tell me now that you love me, Tiny, my little wife?"
               His little wife looked up in his face, and her intelligent eyes, "beautiful as a heifer's" (vide Homer), were
                  filled with an expression of confiding fondness, as she answered.
               "Yes, indeed I will, dear Frank, over and over again. I will tell you now how much
                  I love you, how I have always loved you, almost from the first time we met, and
                  how often I longed to tell you so before we were married, but was prevented by
                  fear of doing wrong, and by maidenly reserve."
               Frank thanked her for the words and the look—how, I shall not tell;
                  and as Kitty was not there, she won't either; but I will communicate this much. He declared, "that to the very end
                  of his days, and a great while longer," he should never cease to think his
                  mother-in-law the wisest of women; or to congratulate himself that he wrote Tiny a
                  "specimen letter;" and displayed such brilliant talent in the matter of the opal
                  ring; and above all maintain, that no heavenlier cherub dwelt on this earth, than
                  his, little sister, otherwise injuriously called L'Enfant
                     Terrible.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE story was finished; and if hearty laughter, like chimes of bells, with close
                  attention, and all their eyes set round Harry's face, like the brilliants round
                  the opal of the fateful ring in the story, were exponents of success, it was
                  eminently, so. Let us see what was said.
               "Oh!" cried Mrs. Wilton, "how I wanted to shake that awful little, Kitty!
                  the—the—imp!! I don't know what to call her."
               The little wife gave me a gleeful glance; and said demurely, "What would
                     you call her, Auntie?"
               "A remarkably sensible and interesting child," I answered in a solemn tone, "and
                  one, who I am quite sure, will grow up—if she has not already done so—into a
                  remarkable woman."
               "A little wretch!" quoth Mrs. Wilton, "a great deal worse than my brother
                  John."
               
               We all clamored to hear about "brother John."
               "Oh certainly! A few weeks ago I called upon a very dear friend; and carelessly
                  left my card case on the centre table—forgot it. Yesterday I was lunching with
                  mamma, and observed that I was going to Mrs. Wood's to get my card case, which she
                  had had six weeks.
               "Don't trouble yourself," said brother Sam, a great awkward schoolboy; "she means
                  to hook it!" Well, I went and took little Johnny with me in his handsome black
                  velvet suit. I felt quite proud of him. I found the card case just where I had
                  left it; and when Mrs. Wood entered, I ran to meet her so affectionately! when
                  that monster Johnny yelled out, 'Why sister! there is the very woman who hooked
                  your card case!!' She stopped short! she stiffened into stone, except her eyes,
                  which blazed with anger! and oh dear! how faint I felt! It was no use to
                  apologize; that small man had lost me my friend, and made me an enemy. So women,
                  after all, don't do all the mischief! There!"
               Then Mr. Wilton, glancing at his wife, quietly said, "Don't they? Oh! ee! ee!"
                  This last was an involuntary, consequent upon getting his ear pinched.
               Upon which "pretty cousin Adelaide" smiled so charmingly that young Appreciate's
                  heart beat quite uncomfortably under his vest; and with his face all in a glow, he
                  begged me to introduce him.
               "How—ow do you do?" he stammered, in the most awkward manner possible; converted
                  into frightened booby by the witchcraft of a smile, and the glance of a pair of
                  violet eyes. It would have been unparalleled barbarity to have kept him in this
                  mortifying condition; so cousin Adelaide, with generous resolution and delicate
                  tact, soon put him comparatively at his ease; and the chocolate coming in
                  opportunely, the evening's entertainment proved most comprehensively satisfactory.
                  Even Mr. Gracie Growler, although he ate the sandwiches with an air of cynical
                  indifference, took a great many, and remarked in a mechanical tone
                  that the story was not morally injurious, or the sandwiches physically
                  disagreeable, which was an amount of praise that made the little wife's face quite
                  radiant, and caused pretty cousin Adelaide to give utterance to such a sweet
                  little singing burst of laughter that young Appreciate got up and shook bands with
                  his uncle Growler, without any apparent rhyme or reason; and furthermore in a
                  sudden glow of affection, offered to give
                  the next reading, which should be a story or essay, in support of his uncle's
                  indignant tirade on the subject of tight lacing. He modestly urged, as he was
                  studying medicine and should soon graduate, he ought to be able to write
                  professionally about it.
               "Yes, sir!" cried Mr. Growler in a rasping voice, to conceal the pleasure, he
                  felt. "You couldn't do a better thing. You just write my foolish sister, and your
                  foolish aunt into a fit of penitence and amendment and you'll find my last will
                  and testament the most entertaining document you ever read. Yes, sir! induce her
                  to give those poor yellow-faced girls the free use of their lungs, and throw
                  anti-bilious pills out of the window—and your preaching will do more for you than
                  your practice by a long shot!"
               
                  His preaching and practice! It was pretty cousin Adelaide's smile
                  that would do it all.
               So the little wife bade her good night, with a tender kiss and a meaning smile,
                  for the incipient doctor had eagerly entreated the honor of escorting her home.
                  You would have thought she was a Sèvres porcelain angel, as to her material
                  presence; so elaborately gentle was his care, and so vengeful the beams that
                  flashed from his eyes, did any one in passing come too near. As she turned her
                  moonlit face upon him, and with smiling thanks, bade him "good night and sweet
                  dreams," at the door of her pleasant home; that last smile—those glorious deep
                  eyes—the velvety touch of the little white fingers—Oh it was all over with him;
                  and as she disappeared within the door, I noticed that the foolish fellow walked
                  slowly away, trembling, or as his uncle would probably express it, "in a hifalutin
                  state of happiness—all but cracked, sir!"
               The rest of us arrived soberly home; after appointing the evening for our next
                  meeting; said our prayers; yes, of this I am certain; and slept the sleep of the
                  just.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               HARRY had been very busy ever since his successful débût in translating and adapting a capital French story, and the
                  healthy interest, he took in his work reacted upon his wife with better effect
                  than gallons of tonics. The ills of life looked marvellously smaller to both; she
                  went singing about the house in the mornings like a lark; she had uncontrollable
                  little fits of laughter, about nobody knows what; she unweariedly taught little
                  Carrie to say such a succession of new and more astonishing things to her father,
                  when he came home to dinner, that he never once looked at the decanter. Thank
                  Heaven! The dread disease had not yet taken root; the good seed was springing up
                  with steadfast growth, and the little wife fenced round her stratagem, with
                  ministering bands of love; and like a skilful general, placed a sentinel at the
                  entrance, more powerful than locks, bolts, or an army of giants,—his own little
                  child.
               We assembled the second evening in high spirits. We were all curiosity and
                  premature criticism. How was young Appreciate to handle so delicate a subject?
                  Mrs. Wilton audibly wondered at his temerity in daring to attack so fashionable a
                  foible.
               "Foible, ma'am!" thundered Mr. Growler, who did not glide into a subject like a
                  serpent, but pitched down upon it like a bombshell. "Foible! you mean vice! vice
                     in a vice! a double crime!"
               "Dear me," remonstrated the provoking woman, "if our waists were the same size as
                  the Venus de Medici's, what dowdy cotton bags we should look like! And then fancy
                  us with the wrists and ancles of the Greek slave! Enormous! clumsy! awful! Now
                  look at that!" she cried; thrusting out a white tiny hand, ending in a small round
                  wrist. "I would give ever so much to have this half its size."
               "It is all out of proportion as it is," growled Mr. Growler. "Perfect little
                  goose!" he muttered.
               "Old fossil!" she whispered to me, with a bewitching little curl, in her lip, and
                  clenching her hand into a small
                  snowball, "I want to pound him!" Then turning, to him with a hypocritical smile,
                  all humility and teachableness, she purred out, "Oh! of course, dear Mr. Growler,
                  you know all about these things scientifically I should like so much
                  to learn how we ought to be proportioned by mathematical tables—the exact number
                  of average inches, you know, which go to make a beautiful woman. Won't you please
                  measure one off for me, sir? all in squares."
               The little wife looked quite terrified at this passage of arms; but there was no
                  need; for the enemy, deceived by the artful wiles of his antagonist, came to
                  quarters as well as squares, and immediately grunted his approbation of her
                  laudable desire to remain no longer in such shocking ignorance of the proper
                  proportions of the human form divine. "Why," he shouted," your hands and feet are
                  absolute deformities! they should be,—your hand, as long as your face, and three
                  times the length of your nose. Your foot should measure four noses, or one sixth
                  the length of your body. Now! look at me; I am six feet, or seventy-two inches
                  high; my nose is three inches long; my hand nine; and my foot twelve inches; all
                  in exact proportion;" and he flourished a hand, and put forth to her horrified
                  view a prodigious member, clad, as she afterward declared, in the identical shoe
                  which sheltered Mother Goose's old woman, and her numberless children. "I will
                  send you a folio treatise on anatomy to-morrow morning; you will peruse it with
                  delight; and wonder as much as I do at your present ignorance."
               "Oh thank you! I shall be so, happy to read it. O—h!!" The last word was in
                  consequence of getting a malicious little unbelieving pinch on the arm from her
                  husband; and in the general laughter at her discomfiture, Mr. Growler forgot to
                  ask what it meant.
               As before, I suggested the reading should now begin; and young Appreciate,
                  smoothing out his manuscript, commenced, after blushing a great deal, and looking
                  deprecatingly at cousin Adelaide, a story entitled:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           CORSETS:
                           AN ABSURD ALLEGORY WITH NEVERTHELESS A GRAVE AND SAD
                              ENDING.
                           ONE evening, at the New York Academy of Music I saw in two separate
                              boxes two young girls, both charming, both blondes, but differing as
                                 much as if one had been
                              a glowing painting, the other a marble statue.
                           The first and youngest had hair of a rich chestnut brown, shaded in
                              parts with a darker hue, falling on either side in careless curls. Her
                              gray eye, fall of fire and resolution, like those of a petted and
                              spoiled child who fears no one, and never dreams of misery or
                              suffering, glanced in a proud, queenly way around the opera house,
                              while her mouth, rosy with pure and healthful blood, curled at the
                              corners with an irresistible expression of playful pouting.
                           The other was pale and delicate—beyond the loveliness that belongs to
                              the hues of health. Her cheeks (for their whiteness was too beautiful
                              to seem like a blight) looked like rose leaves in milk; her eyebrows
                              were scarce distinguishable on her blue-veined forehead; her hair,
                              which only waved a little, had an inexpressible, translucent, golden
                              tone, like that of an Undine or an elf.
                           The first girl seemed to sit in an atmosphere of glorious sunlight;
                              while around the second a mysterious haze, like pale white moonbeams,
                              appeared to envelop her with a faint and sad radiance Her eyes, of a
                              blue as deep and tender as the violet peeping from the snow, swam in
                              their crystal white; while her long, curled eyelashes, constantly
                              rising and falling with a pretty fluttering motion, gave a still
                              softer and more dreamy tone to their melancholy and velvety
                              expression.
                           Her person was slender almost beyond belief—certainly beyond healthful
                              nature, for a pair of hands of ordinary size could easily have spanned
                              her waist.
                           While gazing on these charming children—for the dews of childhood
                              still sparkled freshly on their blossoming years I asked myself:
                           "What will become of them?"
                           "Whom will they love?"
                           "Whom will they marry?"
                           "Consumption, that killing frost of so many of these flowers of
                              beauty—will it not bring a premature fall?"
                           Alas! I observed that the pale girl particularly had that indefinable
                              charm which is destined soonest to fade; she seemed pale with her
                              future death—that gentle shadowy angel whose coming brings no terrors
                              to the pure and holy.
                           The opera house was crowded, for the principal part was rendered by
                              the witching small fairy,
                              Adelina Patti, and all eyes we're upon her; but I watched
                              my pale beauty, irresistibly impelled by I know not what power.
                           Suddenly, in the midst of a bewildering burst of applause for some
                              greater effort than usual from the piquant and brilliant little prima
                              donna, the pale girl fell back white and senseless.
                           She had fainted. I could see that her companions were plainly her
                              parents, as her father clasped her in his arms and carried her to an
                              open window outside. Quickly the mother followed, trembling and
                              heart-stricken. Quickly I followed, and eagerly I offered assistance;
                              but oh! what agony was visible in the countenances of these two, as
                              they looked upon the face of the young girl, white as moonshine, save
                              for the oozing blood that stained her lips. Her silken hair had stolen
                              from its confinement, and, floating down the crisp night wind caught
                              it up and wrapped it round her like a mantle. There she lay, her
                              weight scarcely felt in the arms of her father, who had centred all
                              his heart and hope on this frail, perishing creature, already half
                              transformed into an angel.
                           "Alas! alas!" I heard the mother murmur, "it is her doom to die. Will
                              she never be stronger?" and the hot, agonizing tears fell like
                              rain.
                           Slowly recovering, the young girl sighed, opened her eyes, and in
                              alarm threw her arms round her mother's neck, and, looking wistfully
                              into her face, implored her to speak to her.
                           "Was it my fainting, darling mother? nay, it was but the heat of the
                              house. I am better—I am well;" and with loving, playful sweetness, she
                              kissed the tears from her mother's eyes.
                           Oh! the soft, pure young voice! how its music thrilled me! and from
                              that moment I was determined to know the past and follow the future of
                              that sweet young life.
                           I soon learned, no matter how, that Lilian was the only child of her
                              parents; that, since her birth, their existence was not—they only
                              existed in her. She made the perfume of their home; she
                              was their rest, after the working days were done. Never should she
                              know a thrill of pain or a weary hour. They became children to charm
                              the child, who from her birth never gave them one disrespectful word
                              or look.
                           Lilian had nothing in common with other children; there was an
                              ethereal simplicity in manner ner—a tenderness toward even an unconscious flower; that denoted
                              the union of the intellectual with the childish nature. Her little
                              playmates scarcely dared to sport with her, for they felt her
                              superiority—though, for the first twelve years of her life, her rosy
                              bloom, bounding step, and the undulating graces of her form indicated
                              the highest health.
                           But the fates are jealous; they cannot endure the sight of happiness;
                              and instead of cutting the painful life-thread of the poor paralytic,
                              or the starving wretch who coughed in a garret; they one day fastened
                              their hungry cruel eyes upon this gentle, obedient girl; and
                              instigated by their baleful whisperings in the shape of a French
                              modiste, her mother drew tight around her soft expanding form A PAIR
                              OF CORSETS.
                           Why should I have wished just for one moment, to vail the fact and the
                              name of this torture, under some polite, genteel French jargon? No!
                              let it stand out in fair print—
                           Lilian was mercilessly tortured by CORSETS.
                           Two years passed; and no one dreamed of the real reason why the sweet
                              cheek was paling, and the elastic step grew heavy. They relaxed her
                              school studies; they loosened them altogether; they travelled with
                              her. But the CORSETS were tightened.
                           The doctors ordered perfect rest from study, concentrated and
                              nourishing food, change of air and scene and constant amusement in the
                              regular old fogy style, without troubling their dignified heads about
                              an article of dress. Bless your heart! don't they let the hapless
                              little children of fashionable parents go about in the depth of winter
                              with bare legs and arms, without protests has one ever been known to
                              berate this monstrous pestilent custom of foolish mothers dressing
                              their children in any nonsense "Le Petit
                                 Courrier de Dames" chooses to invent, regardless of
                              health or fitness? Do they know anything about corsets?
                              Of course not! It is no concern of theirs. They leave all those things
                              to the women. Quite inconsistent with masculine dignity.—Bah!
                           And so Lilian was fading away. Fainting fits had now become frequent;
                              and the terrified parents were beginning to despair as they watched
                              their beloved one. It was about this time that I first met them.
                           Two more years passed. Lilian's beauty became disquieting, superhuman, almost fatal.
                              Her fair skin assumed an incredible clearness; her almost transparent
                              hands were whiter than virgin wax; and but for the faint rosy pink of
                              the nails, and the painfully blue course of the veins, one would have
                              thought the life of this world no longer circulated in them.
                           And now her mother watched over the faintest alteration in the
                              countenance of the only one who, save her husband, made up the sum of
                              her life. She dismissed the attendant, and with jealous love waited
                              upon her darling herself.
                           But what is this? One morning in dressing Lilian, her mother thought
                              she perceived an unusual projection in the shoulder blades of the
                              young girl. She looked more attentively; she placed her hand beneath;
                              certainly there was a sensible protuberance; while the chest, for
                              years—precious growing years—compressed by the horrible corset, was
                              flat, almost hollow.
                           Why should I delay to tell it? I feel as if I were confessing a
                              murder. Lilian became humpbacked. They put her in an Orthopedic
                              Institution, in order to have the benefit of proper management and the
                              utmost experience and vigilance of physicians.
                           
                           
                              
                                 "Too late."—p. 111.
                              
                           
                           Alas! The utmost experience and vigilance in the shape of the same old
                              fogies, now put the hapless Lilian into an IRON CORSET! They stretched
                              her on a bed of torture, with great weights here, and great weights
                              there, fastened together, and to her shoulders, so that like buckets
                              in a well, when one ascended the other descended; thus keeping a
                              continual tug and strain attended with frightful torture upon the
                              patient, unmurmuring victim. The experienced and vigilant old fogies,
                              with self-glorying perseverance, abated not one jot, or tittle, of the
                              "treatment," refusing to see that the fatal words "too
                                 late" were written on the wasted brow of the heroic but
                              dying girl.
                           But at last, a strange and wonderful phenomenon was made apparent to
                              even the conservative perceptions of these good old souls. One blessed
                              summer morning, with spectacles on their long noses, and peering
                              closer than usual into "the case," they whispered one to another, what
                              caused an immense pricking up of their long ears. "Why! Pilbocks! Why!
                              Callowmelle! this is no ordinary hump! it is a most unaccountable
                              prolongation of the shoulder blades!"
                           They looked in their books and found nothing; they examined their brains—found those
                              in a hopeless muddle; and in their despair, seeing that their remedies
                              were worse than useless, concluded to act like Christians, and so
                              released the suffering girl from her cuirass, chains, and weights.
                           Then—a more wonderful thing happened! Small feathers, whiter than
                              snow, began to appear upon the back. Feathers! Yes! yes, good people!
                              What you and I, and the doctors, had taken for humps, were in reality
                                 wings! wings, soon to flutter, and spread, and bear
                              Lilian away to joy, rest, peace, HEAVEN!
                           As the stream tends to the ocean, so Lilian hastened fast and faster
                              to her end. Her dread disease, now made ravages, which months before
                              had not shown. The hectic cough grew more hurried and choking; the
                              small red spot on her cheek never went away; the white unsullied wings
                              were growing rapidly.
                           The parents, still young, paled and faded, and became gray-haired,
                              with their impending misery; while friends who loved them turned aside
                              and wept; and prayed that God would comfort them; but none offered
                              earthly comfort.
                           And Lilian, the beautiful ruin, besought her parents not to grieve. In
                              broken whispers, between the intervals of the cruel coughing, she said
                              it was but a short separation; but seeing their agony, she felt how
                              vain was her soothing; and throwing herself on her mother's breast,
                              and taking her father's hand, the woeful tears of the three were
                              mingled together as her sweet life ebbed away.
                           At last the moment came. In the serene and solemn night time, Lilian
                              gently drew away from her parent's embrace; and while with white and
                              awe-struck faces they gazed, she softly closed her eyes upon this
                              world; then, spreading her wings, slowly floated up, up into the still
                              purple sky, and was seen no more.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               "After this, put corsets on your girls!" said Mr. Growler, fairly sobbing, and
                  violently mopping his eyes with a direful red silk pocket handkerchief. "I believe
                  every word of it! wings and all! I wish," he cried, shaking his fist viciously in
                  the air, "I wish I could have the hanging of the woman who invented corsets! It
                  was a woman, of course! no man would have been such a self-sacrificing fool the
                  very touch of a woman, all whalebone and board, is enough to give one an ague fit!
                  No undulating dulating grace, no pliant
                  elasticity, nothing but preposterous wasp-like deformity fastened to the balloons
                  you call hoops. I don't wonder the Eastern sultana was amazed that the European
                  ladies who visited her were made so differently from herself; nor would she
                  believe, till she had examined with eyes and touch, the complicated machinery of
                  whalebones and steel springs, that the normal shapes of all women were
                  identical.
               "Seek nature's path, and mad French fashions leave," he continued, parodying the
                  poet; "when I can find such a woman without the accompanying strong mindedness, I
                  mean to marry her."
               "Take care!" exclaimed Mrs. Wilton; "if it should become generally known that so
                  splendid a prize awaited the renouncing of such vanities as hoops and corsets, a
                  vast legion of spooks, with normal fishing rods of arms, and normal broomstick
                  figures, in white antique drapery, would be discovered down on their knees at your
                  door the very next morning, screaming in voices like electric shocks for the
                  fulfilment of your promise!"
               "Bah!" said Mr. Growler.
               Just then a weak fumbling at the door was heard, and Harry arose to open it. A
                  small straight up-and-down figure in a white garment reaching to tile floor,
                  marched gravely in. The sleepy blue eyes first encountered Mr. Growler's grim
                  visage; then wandering round and seeing so much company, poor little Carrie—for it
                  was she—puckered up her rosebud mouth, and staring at Mr. Growler, set up a most
                  piteous squall, and altogether made such an irresistibly comic embodiment of Mrs.
                  Wilton's spooks, that an irrepressible burst of laughter ensued, followed by
                  another still heartier, when the lady bowed to Nature's champion, and said, "The
                  first installment for you, sir."
               But the mother gathered up Carrie in her lap, and cooed and purred over her, as
                  only mothers can; and found that "Carrie woked up" and found she, was "all alone,"
                  and forthwith scrambled out of her little crib to search through the world for
                  dear mamma and papa, whom she "loved mostest." In accordance with the economy
                  which had been proposed, Carrie's nurse had been discharged; and thus it came to
                  pass that the little one, not without many tremors on the part of her mother, had
                  been left alone.
               The chubby dots of feet were held to the fire to be warmed, after their journey
                  through the cold halls; and a great shawl was wrapped over Mr. Growler's idea of a perfect toilette; and soon the
                  comforted little spook sank to sleep, and was softly carried back to her nest.
               Then we all complimented young Appreciate on his "absurdity," modified with
                  criticisms. I, for one, said, I should have liked it much better, if he had made
                  his victim to corsets die in the normal style; and maintained that here Mr.
                  Growler was not consistent; whereupon he assailed me furiously; insisted upon the
                  wins, and vowed she should not die any other way.
               "But," remonstrated Mr. Wilton, "it makes it all ridiculous! I declare I was just
                  ready to fall a-weeping, when the feathering up came on! Such a new and unexpected
                  consequence made me hysterical, and I came to grief, roaring with laughter. Fancy
                  a fowl with corsets on!"
               We all laughed except cousin Adelaide. I could see that young Appreciate, as he
                  looked at her, thought the heightened color on her cheek, as she just glanced a
                  kind approval of his story, and then bent low her graceful head over some dainty
                  bit of work, was far more beautiful than the blushing roses in her brown hair; and
                  I warrant you, when he escorted her home, he told her so. His uncle Growler and I
                  were always obligingly a few paces behind.
               Then we discussed our chocolate and sandwiches in perfect harmony; there seemed to
                  be no difference of opinion here. Coming after our intellectual jousts, they acted
                  like emollients, and sent us home in perfect charity with each other, with the
                  exception of cousin Adelaide and young Appreciate. It was dawning upon the little
                  wife and me that they were fast getting in perfect love with each
                  other.
               How pleasant these meetings were! and what a comfort it was to me especially, to
                  known that as the door closed upon the last of us, the little wife could lie down
                  with a quiet heart to her rest. In the daytime Harry was busy winding up his
                  mercantile affairs, which probably would be settled with woeful loss indeed; but
                  showed a small balance to begin the world with again. Every evening (for I was
                  almost always there) the little cheerful wife and I would work and talk softly
                  together, while he wrote, and talked at intervals to us. Blue sky overhead, little
                  woman! Your Father in Heaven listens to your prayers, and His Holy Spirit rests
                  like a dove in the house.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               THIS evening, when all were still, I began by saying, "The story I have written
                  and propose to read, is true in every particular. You will be surprised, perhaps I
                  should say annoyed, at the minuteness of description of the first part; but if you
                  listen attentively, you will find, that in order to understand the strange
                  unfolding of the middle of the story, this was absolutely necessary. My weak pen
                  has failed to give you an adequate description of what I felt and suffered. I do
                  not understand anything about it. I only make a statement of facts precisely as
                  they occurred. Here it is," and I proceeded to read, in a voice rendered tremulous
                  by the quickened memory of that sad time of my life, as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           A YARD OF BLACK SILK ELASTIC.
                           ABOUT two o'clock one afternoon in the month of December last, a
                              sudden whim seized me to go into the splendid establishment of the
                              Messrs. Appleton, for the purpose of having my photograph taken. I was
                              standing at the time on the opposite side of the street, gazing at
                              their handsome white marble building, and wishing the eminently polite
                              policeman would come and convoy me across through the dense crowd of
                              vehicles, increased at this moment by a long funeral procession.
                           The noble New York women were then holding their great Union Bazaar in
                              the City Assembly Rooms, which, for the benefit of my out-of-town
                              readers, I will mention are exactly opposite Appletons'. I had just
                              been in these rooms, brilliant with beautiful things and more
                              beautiful women, and had left my daily mite in that labor of love and
                              charity, in the shape of a package of letters for the fair post
                              office. As I crossed Broadway with the help of my affable friend of
                              the police, who told me it was a fine day, I could not help chuckling
                              to myself at the probable bewilderment one of the letters would cause.
                              It purported to come from a lawyer, cool, very polite, but inflexible,
                              who was instructed to commence a suit for breach of promise of
                              marriage; exacting tremendous damages, and accepting of no compromise
                              whatever. It was a special
                              letter, and addressed to a boy of nineteen years, of surpassing beauty
                              and rare intellectual promise, whose mother was one of my intimate
                              friends. He was her only child, and she a widow—a rich widow—all the
                              worse for him. Together my friend and I had concocted this precious
                              document, not without hope of benefit; for the impetuous boy had
                              offered himself to a pretty little school-girl, whom he had met at a
                              watering place the summer before—"Just for the fun of the thing," he
                              said, and had forgotten her six weeks afterward, without the slightest
                              idea that the grim Gorgon of a mamma might come some fine day and hold
                              him to his word and vow.
                           We had tried hard to frighten him, but he only laughed at us; and so
                              he went on, moving like a king in society—said society in this most
                              progressive land being composed of materials similar to the family of
                              the good old lady who informed the census taker that they were "mostly
                              boys and girls."
                           Thus he was in unfair danger of being spoiled by the soft, sweet, and
                              silly young women who make up the many of most fashionable circles.
                              Who would have them otherwise? Marry! not I! and marry could not they
                              if they were. So out upon that depraved philosopher who perniciously
                              desires fashionable young ladies to aim at wearing on their fair brows
                              the insignia of a royal womanhood; brows radiant with the beauty of
                              souls, large, deep, and spiritual. Granting that he is a philosopher,
                              he would certainly be the merest bumpkin of a logician did he not know
                              that such undesirable merit would fatally disturb the admirable
                              balance now patent between the sexes in Young Americadom.
                           I was just turning the knob of Appletons' door to enter, when my
                              handsome young friend came suddenly in sight. He dashed up to me in
                              his quick, joyous way, and, seizing my disengaged hand, cried out
                              "Well, Auntie Fantie, what is the last piece of mischief on the
                              bulletin?"
                           I felt a guilty blush rising as I retorted, "Oh, yes! you ask me that,
                              you naughty scamp, because it is your own most besetting sin. It seems
                              to me you are forever in Broadway. You spend your time pretty much as
                              Satan is said to do in the book of Job, 'passing to and fro on the
                              earth and walking up and down on it.'"
                           "I hope you don't think I resemble Satan in other respects?" said he, with a low
                              bow, glancing at his boot and touching one of the handsome curls on
                              his forehead.
                           "Cloven hoofs and horns? Well!" (I pretended to meditate) "well, it
                              pains me to say that you are so headstrong, and so headlong, and
                              so—"
                           "On and so forth, you know;" he laughed good-naturedly, then stopping
                              suddenly and looking down upon me with a ridiculous air of paternal
                              gravity, and rolling his words in his mouth like the comic man in
                              Ravel's pieces, or the eminent tragedian,—pumped out, "My most
                              estimable aunt (this was only my brevet title), "an impossible little
                              bundle of virtues like yourself cannot appreciate the necessity of
                              cultivating a few, a very few wild oats. They—"
                           "COME," said a low voice of honeyed sweetness.
                           We both turned quickly round, and the boy's face crimsoned furiously
                              as his gaze met the eyes, large, shining, and black, of a most
                              beautiful woman. Above the forehead, whiter than the purest ivory, was
                              parted raven hair, glossy, luxuriant and waving; the aquiline nose,
                              with the thin, curved nostril, would have given a supremely haughty
                              expression to her face had it not been for the enchanting chanting
                              sweetness of the rosy, dimpling mouth, which now disclosed small,
                              white teeth, of flashing, almost startling brilliancy.
                           Her dress was dark, plain, and extremely elegant; a tone of the
                              highest breeding seemed to pervade her entire person, and yet—and,
                              yet, alas! an inscrutable something, which shot down into my heart
                              like a leaden bolt, told me that she was only a splendid ruin—a lost
                              life for this world.
                           He raised his hat to me, and was moving quickly away, when I caught
                              his hand and whispered imploringly, "Oh, Arthur! your mother!
                                 don't go, don't go with her!"
                           Angry now at my interference, he broke rudely away, and the two passed
                              down the street, the woman turning upon me a glance blazing with
                              defiance and hatred, while the mouth in the same tone of enthralling
                              sweetness uttered the words, "I have his promise—he is
                                 mine."
                           It had all passed in a moment; and, while my heart was throbbing with
                              grief at this most painful discovery, not one of the passing crowd so
                              gayly dressed, save two Sisters of Charity who came trailing solemnly
                              by, but supposed that what I have now related was merely the leaving of
                              one acquaintance to join another.
                           I dropped my veil, for scalding tears were swelling in my eyes, and,
                              entering the great book store, I took up the first volume I chanced
                              upon, pretending to read and trying to compose myself.
                           Something ought to be done—must be done to save my
                              friend's darling; her heart would surely break if he were lost. She
                              had been so faithful to, her duty. From his lisping babyhood he had
                              been taught to pray at her knee, and the divine lessons of the Book of
                              books had been lovingly impressed upon him by precept and example.
                              Until his seventeenth year he had been in everything perfect—perfect
                              to our finite eyes—so beautiful and so good! and since then we had
                              only thought him a little wilful once in a while.
                           The fairest woman might have envied the dazzling clearness of his
                              complexion, radiant with health, and yet so delicate that it would
                              have seemed effeminate had not the beautiful features been exceedingly
                              bold and masculine, and the, glance of his blue eye as sharp and
                                 straight out as an eagle's. His hair, of the brightest
                              golden brown, lay in masses of loose rings all over his handsome head.
                              He was fully six feet in height, with unusual breadth of shoulder; and
                              his strength, even at this time, was so great that only the day
                              before, when I was at; his mother's, and the servant had entered and
                              announced dinner, he had caught me up suddenly under one arm, and his
                              mother under the other, and, in spite of our laughing struggles, had
                              carried us through the length of her drawing rooms, and placed us in
                              our chairs at the table.
                           As a lad, his mother, with the rarest good sense, had made his home
                              the most delightful place in the world to him. Many and many a
                              Saturday had he rushed into the house, with half a dozen great noisy
                              boys at his heels, and, scouting out, "Mother! dear mother! we are all
                              going to dine with you!" would go dashing upstairs three steps at a
                              time with a "Come on fellows, and wash your hands;" and in a few
                              moments would make his appearance in the dining room with his
                              companions, all duly brushed and washed, in perfect confidence of a
                              hearty welcome. And many were the whispered commendations which the
                              boys made to each other, at these improvised dinner parties, of "I
                              say! what a jolly mother Arthur's got!" "She's great!" I am afraid I must record that
                              one of them said, "She's bully!"
                           Now this must mean something very fine, from the universal assent
                              which the opinion obtained, but it sounds to me very
                                 coarse in connection with a lady of such gentle breeding and
                              admirable courtesy. In fact, it sounds very coarse in any
                              connection—but never mind! they all admired her tremendously and
                              considered her far more "jolly" and the other word than the roast
                              chickens and cranberry jam.
                           But, all this was in Arthur's innocent and beautiful boyhood. Was the
                              dawning of his still more Beautiful manhood to be clouded by the
                              stormy rise of an unholy passion? Ah! no. Heaven forbid it! I would
                              watch and pray and work to prevent it. It would be my duty to do so at
                              any sacrifice. I would not tell his mother—at least not now. There was
                              no need of fastening this vulture upon her heart if he turned back in
                              time.
                           With a great sigh I dismissed these grief-laden thoughts from my mind,
                              and, putting down the book, of which did not know even the title, I
                              approached the counter on which numberless stereoscopic pictures and
                              portraits, and an endless variety of admirably-executed cartes de visite were displayed.
                           Making my wishes known to a gentleman of exceedingly prepossessing
                              manners, who presided at the desk, I was immediately put through the
                              following preliminaries:
                           I was to find a small boy, and hand him an order which the pleasant
                              gentleman had filled in my behalf. A glance, and three steps brought
                              me to a small boy standing on one foot, the other raised up behind him
                              quite out of sight, and planted flat against a pillar to steady
                              himself.
                           He was deeply engaged in making a clucking noise with his tongue
                              against the roof of his mouth.
                           "Oh! you 
                                 are are
                                 are
                               an old hen! I thought you were a small boy," I said, very
                              solemnly.
                           The little urchin grinned, took the paper, looked at it, dropped his
                              foot, and uttering the cabalistic words "Follow me," commenced a march
                              in double-quick time, which took us through the entire length of the
                              store, and straight out of the back door into Mercer street.
                           Slightly surprised at this, but amiably confident of the integrity of
                              intention which governed this singular proceeding on the part of the
                              small boy, in whose chubby
                              face there did not lurk the faintest foreshadowing of traitorous
                              ambush or murderous trap-door intentions, I followed obediently. He
                              crossed over, went down the street a little, entered a door, mounted
                              two flights of stairs, took four steps to the right, turned round and
                              grave me grin number two; opened the right hand door, and with a sniff
                              of satisfaction, ushered me into the photographic rooms. Then handing
                              me my order, he took one hop to the door, one skip to the stairway,
                              one jump to each flight, and was gone.
                           Barring the scent of the chemicals which do not exhale precisely the
                              gales of Araby the Blest, I found myself in a very cheerful-looking,
                              pleasant place.
                           Resting on one side of the room was a large movable-scene,
                              sufficiently well painted, intended for the benefit of the
                              romantically inclined, who by its aid could perpetrate an innocent
                              fraud upon their friends; giving them to understand that they were
                              then on their travels in the groves of Arcadia, and were at that
                              particular moment about to cross the Sylvan lake, and join a joyous
                              party who were dancing, singing, and flirting on the opposite
                              shore.
                           There was also a portable, crimson-curtained. window, quite gorgeous,
                              with a respectable quantity of fashionably frescoed wall on either
                              side; through which the pensive or the deeply intellectual might be
                              discovered and portrayed, as looking at the silvery moon, or a three
                              story waterfall, or a very large book, the larger the better, resting
                              upon its ledge.
                           A heavy dark blue curtain fell from, ceiling to floor, mid-wise across
                              the room, separating, as I soon discovered, His Majesty the sun's
                              studio from this outer reception room. This curtain was slightly drawn
                              up at one extremity, and when I entered, two persons were standing
                              just within the opening conversing. I could see that one, of them was
                              a man of stately proportions. The other, hidden entirely behind the
                              heavy folds of the drapery I knew was a woman by the voice, which,
                              like a silver bell, was singularly clear, sweet, and vibrating.
                           In spite of all my well-bred efforts not to listen, while I was
                              doffing bonnet and cloak to be ready for my turn, I could not help
                              catching some parts of the conversation.
                           The gentleman was evidently preparing to sit for his portrait.
                           "A young lady," he said, with a little deprecating cating laugh, "can very well make her
                              appearance on a carte de visite in a
                              fancy costume and a smirk; but a man, and especially a clergyman,
                              should assume a dignified, serious air, yet one pleasing to his
                              friends."
                           "Well, Doctor," said the clear, ringing voice, "if you will think of
                              the text you gave us last Sunday morning, you cannot help putting on
                              the same look you then wore, of mingled resolution and joy, as you
                              stood silent (one moment before you began your sermon), that its
                              blessed promise might sink into our hearts;" and her voice deepened
                              and softened, and its melody thrilled me as she repeated the promise
                              which sank deep in my heart, "'Be thou faithful unto
                              death, and I will give thee a crown of life.'"
                           He turned at this moment, and I saw who it was. How I longed to say to
                              him, if he would only put on the look of fearless courage with which
                              he had stood up and done battle in his Master's cause a few Sundays
                              before in my hearing; the right expression would come! In
                              the trumpet-like tones of his grand voice, he had denounced those who
                              "did evil that good might come." While he spoke, every application of
                              that terrible text, sank deep in my heart, as my own conscience,
                              taking sides with him, sat in judgment upon me. Convicted and
                              convinced, I had gone sadly home, resolved thenceforth to do no evil,
                              for the coming of any good whatever. Alas! for the resolutions made in
                              one's own strength! That very week had witnessed my fall from grace.
                              Every evening, I had assisted at the Great Fair in selling at the
                              table of my beautiful friend Mrs. R. and with might and main had set
                              forth the brilliant results of, raffling; the immense
                              good to the poor that would come of this very genteel sort of—must I
                              say it?—gambling; and I had induced nine tenths of those who had
                              listened to my specious orations to try their luck. The forgotten text
                              and broken promises now stared me in the face.
                           Soon, a white, sacerdotal robe flashed past the opening, and I saw
                              that this brave Soldier of Heaven, dressed in his outward armor, was
                              ready for the artist.
                           The next instant, the clear voice said, "Doctor, no one likes to be
                              looked at when they are having their likeness taken; I will go
                              away."
                           The lady came into the room where I sat. She was tall and dark; with
                              large, beautiful eyes, a sweet and intellectual expression, and that
                              indefinable air of refinement which pervades the entire person of an
                              inborn gentlewoman. She was without bonnet or cloak, and her dress of
                              black silk, three or four inches below the waist was confined by a
                              ribbon, as I thought, bound round, drawing it tightly in, and making a
                              sort of puff above at the very top of the skirt, for no reason that I
                              could divine.
                           What did it mean? You will understand my puzzling over this, when you
                              call to mind that the autocrat, Fashion, had at present decreed that
                              there should be no trimming, save at the very edge of the dress; and
                              no one but Mrs. Bloomer among women, and Mr. Greeley among men, would
                              dare to dress after an "ism," and send fashion to the ——. Hum! I don't
                              know where they send her.
                           But I do know, that from my earliest childhood to the present moment,
                              I have been tormented with an abnormal quantity of Mother Eve's
                              failing. Ask questions, I must. Examine objects of curiosity, I do at
                              any risk;. Sometimes the result has been edifying and satisfactory.
                              More times I have been compelled to reflect at my leisure upon, the
                              deplorable fate of Blue Beard's wife, etc.; and to wish that Blue
                              Beard, Epinetheus, and my husband had locked up his wife, Pandora and
                              me, singly and separately, before we had gone and opened doors and
                              boxes and asked questions, which were none of our business.
                           But I must ask; and this time the result was—What it was
                              I will tell you.
                           I approached the lady with a mincing step and deprecating smile; and
                              in the "coaxiest" tones I could muster, said, "Madam, will you permit
                              me to ask you an impertinent questions?"
                           She drew up just a perceptible atom; then smiling, simply answered,
                              "Yes."
                           "What is that you wear round your dress?"
                           "A yard of black silk elastic."
                           "Hem! But why do you wear it?" 
                           "To hold up my dress in unpleasant weather."
                           "Hold up! how?"
                           "Thus: the ends are sewed securely together; I put it over my head,
                              and a short distance down on the skirt of my dress. I pull my dress up
                              so;" she continued suiting the action to the word, and greatly,
                              increasing the size of the puff above; "and you observe, it lifts it
                              from the ground higher or lower, at my pleasure. I have used pages and
                              other contrivances, but I find this much the best of any. Of course, my cloak covers the
                              machinery."
                           "Ah yes! how very nice! What an excellent idea! Thank you! I should
                              like to adopt it."
                           She bowed; and just then the clergyman, looking grand and stately in
                              his white and flowing robes, emerged from the draped-up curtains.
                              There was such a winning smile upon his face, and he looked so
                              completely the embodiment of those lines from Tennyson's "In
                              Memoriam," 
                                 
                                    "And thus he bore without abuse
                                    The grand old name of Gentleman,"
                                 
                               that I felt that words, spoken with courtesy, would meet with a
                              like return; so I ventured to ask "Are you executed, sir?"
                           "I believe I am," he answered smiling, "and you are going to be
                              executed, I see; I hope it will be well and thoroughly done. I shall
                              wait to see it."
                           I laughed, thanked him, and went in.
                           The first thing that caught my eye was a well-painted scene of the
                              broad aisle of an immense church. The impression of "a dim, religious
                              light," falling in slant rays from the stained windows, was conveyed
                              with considerable skill. I immediately intimated that would be taken
                              as if in church.
                           The artist bowed; and with gentle courtesy placed me in the position
                              his quick eye and multifarious experience suggested, as the best for
                              my coming out of the trial with éclât. He twitched my drapery here, he
                              twitched it there; he put an obtrusive thumb and two fingers into
                              banishment; he gently moved my head in a more erect position; though I
                              told him that I had a ridiculous lackadaisical habit of holding it
                              very much on one side; he softly smoothed a stray crimple of my hair,
                              and then he dragged up behind me a tremendous pair of pincers. (I
                              don't know what the right name is, I'm sure.) It was fastened to a
                              perpendicular iron pole and standard;, and with this horrible machine
                              he proceeded to clutch my head.
                           "Oh don't!" I cried; "I won't be fastened into that abominable thing!
                              I will not."
                           "It is necessary, madam," said the artist. 
                           "Not at all! It will make my eyes, start out of their sockets! It will
                              jerk my chin forward I shall be impelled to run my tongue out to keep
                              front choking! I will sit as still as Judge —— when he listens, fast asleep, to a suit
                                 against the corporation."
                           "It will steady the pulsations," persisted the artist, firmly, yet
                              with perfect courtesy. "See—I will arrange it so that it will scarcely
                              touch your head."
                           I grumbled, and asked him when he had gotten it from the Inquisition;
                              and called it various unhandsome names, and lamented that so
                              well-meaning a person as myself should be held hard and fast by such a
                              detestable iron vice; but finally submitted, and was well pinched
                              up.
                           Then the artist went behind his mahogany box, or whatever he calls it;
                              put a thick black cloth over his head, and peeped at me through the
                              glasses.
                           "How do I look?" I asked.
                           "Excellently well," he answered. "You know of course, that in the lens
                              you are represented as upside down."
                           "Oh! I'm upside down, am I? What an idea! But let me think; I seem to
                              remember that somebody has written, 'The right way to catch God's
                              thought in a landscape is to look at it with inverted eyes;' and here,
                              as if to prove this apparent ent contradiction, I stand as I am; and
                              presto! His sun paints me upside down."
                           It seemed almost wicked to laugh; but I could not help imagining an
                              absurd phase of this theory. I pictured an enthusiastic artist
                              standing in an open field—his legs making the letter A—his head bent
                              down, gazing between them at the landscape with inverted
                                 eyes—rapt—enchanted—absorbed—and a great bull just going to
                              charge him in front, and upset everything. But I wisely kept this
                              brilliant result of inversion to myself; and politely simpered, "Dear
                              me! it must be the very best way of deciding on a likeness. I shall
                              have all my pictures, and portraits at home turned topsy-turvey. I
                              hope you will make me look, as amiable as possible."
                           "It will be a correct likeness, I 'trust. His' Majesty the sun will be
                              sure to have you right after his downright fashion; and
                              it will be our endeavor to finish you right in your own
                                 upright fashion. There! your pose is
                              admirable—couldn't be better! Keep quite still, if you please; I will
                              get the plate and be back in a moment."
                           He went away. And now fancy me with my eyes shut, thinking of all the
                              dear little children knew
                              and loved, hoping by this to invest my face with an amiable and
                              becoming expression and forget the detestable old pincher into which
                              my head was screwed. Arthur's face came in with the children's, and
                              troubled me.
                           Suddenly something fell with a quick SNICK! A blinding flash shot
                              through my closed eyelids into my brain; a heavy cloth, like a pall,
                              was thrown over me, and speechless with terror, I felt myself caught
                              up; swiftly borne through the room, through the outer room, down the
                              stairs, across the sidewalk, and into a carriage.
                           The door was shut, and we drove furiously off. I say "we," for some
                              one was sitting by my side holding the cloth; but silent as death.
                           We seemed to go through quiet side streets, for the speed of the
                              horses never slackened. After a while we turned a corner; then
                              another; and I knew by the noise and our impeded progress, that we
                              were in Broadway.
                           A few moments more, and the carriage stopped. I was lifted out, and
                              borne across the sidewalk into some large building; for many steps
                              were taken before I was gently seated; and then the black cloth seemed
                              to part away from my face like a veil rent in twain.
                           I found myself in an immense church; solemn, dark and hung with black;
                              giving an impression of commingled gloom and grandeur. In a maze of
                              wonder and vague dread, I closed my eyes to gain time for thought to
                              make sure that this was not a delirium of the brain. In a few moments
                              I opened them again. That it was all real, I could not doubt. My
                              stupor of terror was fast dissipating; and though still under terrible
                              excitement, I felt that this was indeed the reality of waking
                              life.
                           Black everywhere. Draped upon the pulpit, chancel rails, and lecturn;
                              wreathing the tall pillars, and covering the marble aisles. It needed
                              but the coffin and the pall to complete the mournful picture. All the
                              pews near the altar and far down the broad aisle were occupied; but,
                              by what seemed a strange accident, while every other pew was
                              appropriately filled, as I thought with persons in the deepest black,
                              the intervening ones were crowded with women in the gayest
                              costumes.
                           Soon the doors on either side of the chancel opened; and Sisters of
                              Charity came trailing in two and two, holding long webs of fine white
                                 linen. They spread these
                              upon the altar and chancel rails over and over again; and every time
                              they did so, an icy wind sweeping in from some unknown quarter, caught
                              the snowy webs and blew them violently aside. While they were yet
                              vainly endeavoring to cover the ominous black with the white cloth,
                              some one came hastily up the aisle saying in a loud voice, "The man
                              and woman about to be married will now enter. All present must close
                              their eyes during the ceremony. If any look up, it will be at his or
                              her deadly peril."
                           Like succeeding waves, the sitters in every pew bent forward their
                              faces; I among the rest.
                           The great doors swung heavily open. There was one moment of deep,
                              breathless silence; then came a loud and sudden tolling of the
                              bell—between the boding pauses of which, were heard soft, measured
                              footfalls approaching.
                           Shivering with an indefinable fear of I knew not what, I battled for a
                              moment with the demon which has possessed me all my life long; then,
                              irresistibly impelled, I raised my head and looked round.
                           Great Heaven! Arthur and the beautiful lost woman!
                           A ghastly pallor had overspread his features, and his eyes were bent
                              upon the ground; but her face almost emitted rays. An intense splendor
                              of mysterious, electrical joy shot from her magnificent black eyes,
                              while a triumphant smile curved her lovely mouth and irradiated every
                              feature.
                           They passed and stood at the chancel rails, and my wildly-wandering
                              eyes followed them.
                           A clergyman now stood within, book in hand—the same! the same with
                              whom I had talked at the photographic rooms!
                           Paralyzed with grief and horror, I saw him open the book. The clang of
                              the tolling bell ceased as I was vainly wishing that, rather than
                              this, Arthur had been brought thither in his coffined shroud. His
                              mother's heart was now sure to break.
                           In a low, musical monotone, which sounded like the echo of the bell,
                              the minister commenced the solemn marriage service. Then louder and
                              deeper came the awful words, "If any man can show cause why they may
                              not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter
                                 forever hold his peace."
                           I heard a ghostly whisper like an echo in my ear, "Do your duty at any 
                                 sacifice
                                 sacrifice
                              ." Then his eye
                              fell upon mine, and in the expression of his grand, silent face, I
                              read "Be thou faithful unto death."
                           Trembling—gasping—my hands wildly raised aloft, I shrieked out,
                              "I—I—know a cause! Separate them, I pray, for the love of heaven!"
                           Arthur turned—his face was livid. A bitter struggle convulsed his
                              frame, for he felt the presence of his mother's spirit in my agonized
                              cry. He clung to the chancel rails, but he neither spoke nor
                              stirred.
                           And she! In her low, sweet voice, which had now a tone that froze my
                              blood, she spoke to the people there: "Look up! You are all mine. With
                              my great wealth I have bought you, souls and bodies. This woman
                                 must die. Through her you know with whom I would have
                              married. Had I succeeded, we would have fled forever from this cursed
                              spot, where the foul fiend tempted me and I listened, until the very
                              air grew rank and thick, and shut out God from my soul—until this part
                              of the fair earth has become like the deepest hell from which there is
                              no rescue or forgiveness. In other lands I could, I would have
                              repeated. I could and would have won from the recording angel a
                              pitying tear, to fall upon and blot out the written history of my
                              transgressions. I could and would have wrestled and prayed, until a
                              blessed forgiveness had descended like dew upon my parched heart from
                              Him against whom alone I have sinned. Now I have lost ALL."
                           Then turning to me with a hoarse groan and sob, as if torn out of her
                              breast, she cried, "Oh! woman, woman! could you not leave me this one
                              small ray from heaven?"
                           A tear like a great diamond rose and trembled on her eyelid for an
                              instant—a pure, bright, crystal drop, in which all the first innocent
                              years of her life lay glistening, trembling, softly entreating for
                              mercy in this hard world for this woman—world-condemned and lost.
                              Another instant, and it was forced violently back; the blood left her
                              cheek, and a murderous glare flashed out from her eyes.
                           "Go, some of you, and take the ribbon from the lady by the door. I
                              would have this woman garroted. Her eyes that dared to look shall
                              start from their sockets; her tongue that dared to speaks shall be,
                              forced swollen and blackened from her mouth; he livid and distorted
                              face shall be a horror to look upon!"
                           All the black-robed women came out of one of the pews, and, with quick, 
                                 noiselesss
                                 noiseless
                               steps, went down the aisle toward some person in the
                              distance. The rest kept their places, looking on solemn and still.
                           Arthur had sunk down against the rails, his face buried in his hands;
                              and the minister stood erect, rigid, one hand clasping his book, the
                              forefinger of the other dividing the leaves at the marriage service.
                              As well might he have been a marble man, so statue-like were the lines
                              of his face, so motionless the white folds of his robe. He seemed
                              under the influence of an intense mesmeric spell.
                           And now a faint sound of supplication reached my ear. Thick clouds
                              must have passed over the sky, for the light through the stained
                              windows cast a brooding gloom through the great church. Looking back,
                              I could but faintly see the ill-omened women surrounding and forcing
                              something violently away from one who vainly sought with desperate
                              struggles to retain it. In another moment they were returning with the
                              same stealthy tread and their ill-gotten possession. I could now
                              perceive the lady. Her large eyes, wild and distended, were gazing at
                              me; her white lips moving; her clasped hands were piteously stretched
                              toward me. I fancied I heard a broken entreaty of "Forgive! forgive
                              me! They tore it from me." Straining my eyes through the gloom, I
                              recognized the lady of whom I had asked question's in the photographic
                              rooms.
                           Then, with a puzzled dismay I turned, and saw held aloft, in the hands
                              of one of the women with whom she had struggled, the yard of
                                 black silk elastic.
                           
                           What had this to do with the death that awaited me?
                              Garroted? Where was the cruel iron collar in which my throat was to be
                              crushed?
                           As if answering my thought, the icy-cold voice said "This will do.
                              Strangling is a more painful death. Go, one of you, into the church
                              yard, and fetch from thence a small, but strong bough; it will serve
                              as a tourniquet."
                           I looked around appealingly with tear-blind eyes at the stony faces;
                              at the distant doors where strong men kept guard; at the lady who sat
                              near them, weeping and helpless; at the marble minister; at Arthur's
                              crouching, shuddering form, and at my pitiless executioner.
                           No hope anywhere. I might scream, but the utmost cry of my agony would
                              be lost in the roar and
                              whirl of the crowded street outside, and—in my dread despair I forgot
                              to pray.
                           They held me fast, and passed the ribbon round my throat; tied it
                              tightly once, then again with the tourniquet between. I heard the loud
                              beatings of my heart; it seemed tolling for my coming death. In a
                              gasping, choking voice, I implored them not to murder me, in this
                              sacred place—anywhere but here—any death but that awful one. Like a
                              rebuking presence from another world, the sun at this moment broke
                              suddenly from the dark clouds, and beams of radiant splendor shot
                              through the great painter windows behind the altar, bathing the
                              fiendish crowd in rays of red and purple glory. One instant they
                              paused, as if they saw an EYE looking down, then turned away
                                 from the light to their deed of darkness.
                           Like a panoramic picture, but moving at lightning speed, all the
                              events of my life passed through my brain. They seemed so short and
                              blissful. I thought of my husband, who had loved me all our married
                              years more like a lover than a husband. I wished, with bitter,
                              remorseful tears, that I had never grieved his kind heart and trifled
                              with his love, by many a petulant word and cold return. I thought; of
                              my children and from the very depth of my tortured heart rose a cry,
                              "Oh, my children! Oh, my children! Nevermore shall I return home, and
                              thrill with joy to hear your flying footsteps coming near and nearer,
                              and feel your twining clasp, and the loving struggle against my face
                                 for the "first kiss."
                           
                           In a horrible silence they turned the tourniquet round and round. A
                              stroke of lightning seemed to strike and wither every nerve in my
                              body, and the blood I thought was bursting forth from the pores of my
                              face; my sight became blurred, and the faces around were like the
                              faces of monsters. Dull flames darted from the eyes of the murderous
                              woman on the chancel step. The elastic ribbon gave and yielded, only
                              to prolong my tortures.
                           They turned again with demoniac strength. My eyes started from their
                              sockets, drops of blood fell slowly from the arched ceiling; a
                              thousand clanging bells rang in my ears, and my tongue burst from my
                              mouth.
                           Up rose a fiendish shriek, "Turn! turn!" A lurid flash! and the
                              blackness of darkness like a funeral pall came settling down—down.
                           
                           
                           "Good heavens, madam!" cried an anxious voice, "are you ill?"
                           Something painful and heavy was drawn away from my throat.
                           With a mighty effort I opened my eyes; with a mightier I crushed back
                              a flood of hysterical tears, and said quietly enough, "I'm a little
                              hurt; you see what comes of using that terrible thing."
                           He saw, indeed, with his physical eyes, and what he saw he understood;
                              but, oh! could he have beheld the delirium of mingled terror, wonder,
                              and gratitude which was raging in my soul! Could he have known that
                              every beat of my heart was chanting in my ear the grateful retrain,
                              "Thank God, it is not real! Thank God, it is not real!" doubtless he
                              would have concluded that I had been seized with sudden madness.
                           And so I held my peace, except to ask indifferently how long he had
                              been out of the room. He said, "Not more than two minutes."
                           During the next two minutes my photograph was taken.
                           In the wild, sad, inward look of the eyes, lies chained
                              the shadowy ghost of those two first awful minutes. It will never
                              leave those pictured eyes.
                           But the apparition faded and died out of my bodily eyes at the first
                              potter of the distant feet of my children, which came immediately upon
                              my well-known ring of the house-door bell; and the moment I entered,
                              the welcome pressure of their faces against mine for that ineffable
                              prize, "the first kiss," brought the wonted color to my cheek. And oh,
                              my husband! won't I be a good little wife after this!
                           
                           That night I added to my usual prayers a fervent supplication that
                              Arthur might be arrested on the brink of this precipice, whose swift
                              sides led to the bottomless pit. One stumbling step had already been
                              taken, leaving a bruised and blackened spot upon his soul. I prayed
                              with tears that this might be washed out in his and my Redeemer's
                              blood.
                           Worn and tired, feeling as if I had in that one day passed through
                              years of sharp suffering, I fell asleep with this prayer still
                              murmuring in my heart and on my lips.
                           Then I dreamed that an angel floated down out of the boundless,
                              far-off Heaven, with a majestic undulating movement, that made a low,
                              sweet music sic in the air,
                              and folded his wide-spreading, plumy wings close at my bedside.
                              August, beautiful, love divine irradiating his whole person, and
                              filling the room with a soft effulgence like moonlight, I gazed upon
                              him with level hand to shade my eyes from the unaccustomed glory, but
                              not in the least afraid. As he leaned over me, I saw, resting in the
                              solemn splendor of his eyes, that wide, tender, never-failing, CHARITY
                              which "rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth." In the
                              solemn splendor of his eyes was resting, ready to start into life,
                              that "joy" which is felt in heaven "over one sinner that
                              repenteth."
                           He bent to my ear and whispered, in a tone like a flute breathed over
                              still waters, these words, "Thy trance was no fruitless warning. Watch
                              and pray."
                           Even as he spoke he seemed far away, and the melodious sound of his
                              voice and the radiance of his presence gently faded out, and my sleep
                              became dreamless.
                           
                           Early the next morning there came a violent ringing of the bell.
                              Before the servant could get to the door it was sharply repeated. With
                              a vague alarm and still nervous, I ran into the hall just as the door
                              was opened, and Arthur's mother, ghastly and tottering, staggered
                              toward me, with a piercing cry of "Arthur! Arthur!" and sank fainting
                              on the floor.
                           In an instant I had raised her, and, bending over her, I said, "Oh, my
                              dear friend, what is it? what is it distressing you so?"
                           "Arthur," she. sobbed, in broken murmurs; "he did not come home last
                              night! He has been murdered! He would never have caused me this
                              torture if he were alive! I have waited and watched at the window the
                              whole night. Oh, help me to find what is left of my child!"
                           "Murdered!!!" The blood rushed madly to my brain, then, back to my
                              heart! Terror and dread had seized me! My trance was before me! Yes;
                              Arthur, if not already lost forever, was in deadly jeopardy; but it
                              was his soul—his, soul that was in peril. Hell was opening before him,
                              but, God willing, we two women, feeble in ourselves but strong in His
                              might; would close the accursed gates before it was too late.
                           So, rousing myself, I essayed, gradually and tenderly as I could, to
                              tell her all I knew; what I
                              had seen the day before; the wondrous beauty and grace of the woman,
                              and the utter infatuation of the boy. She listened trembling,
                              miserable. Bitter thoughts coursed each other across her breaking
                              heart, and came upon her face as clouds flit over a sad, watery sky.
                              The long years of her love—such utterly unselfish love as none but a
                              mother can give—stood up awful witnesses against him; and this was the
                              cruel end, and hope seemed dead.
                           To give her a gleam of comfort I acted hypocrite, and assured her of
                              our certainty of seeing him before the day was over. Heaven forgive
                              me! for I too was hopeless; but I cried aloud, "Courage, dear friend!
                              We shall save him! He will return to you repentant, never again to
                              sin;" and all the while smiting at my heart was a bludgeon-like voice
                              I could not silence, saying, "Who lost Mark Antony the world?" "A
                              woman!"
                           Here was a boy of nineteen, his fancy and passions a-blaze, and the
                              woman, high bred, perhaps of exquisite accomplishments and talents,
                              which, like a skilful strategist, she would bring out one after the
                              other to enchain his soul. What fearful odds! Where was there a shadow
                              of hope! And once more, as in my trance, I thought, "To have seen him
                              in his coffined shroud would be sorrow indeed, but this was
                              despair."
                           It was a case to be carefully kept from friends, and especially
                              relatives; for all the former and not a few of the latter would have
                              found employment by no means disagreeable in lifting up hands and
                              eyes, and ejaculating a never-ending flow of "I told you so's," "I
                              knew what would come of her wicked indulgence." Then they would clap
                              on the microscope to see how my poor friend looked, and cover their
                              uncharitable sniffs and speeches with a flimsy vail of condolence and
                              much advice.
                           No. We two forlorn women would do as God—not our friends and
                              relatives—would please to direct. And so, after many scalding tears
                              for the exposure to a stranger, the unhappy mother consented that I
                              should call into our councils a captain of police.
                           I told him the whole story, describing the woman accurately, and
                              showing him a large photograph of Arthur in my possession. I also drew
                              out of my album an exquisite vignette, which I offered to give into
                              his careful keeping. We promised him a large sum of money if he found
                              the boy—if he found him with speed, and, above all, such secrecy as would enable us to keep
                              this our skeleton from the knowledge of the condoling and sympathetic
                              (?!) world, including friends and relatives.
                           The man's lynx eyes drank in the features from both pictures, his
                              eyebrows drawn down and together, and his hands curved round the cards
                              like talons. Then, looking up and touching his forehead, he said he
                              had the likeness there, and, to my friend's visible
                              relief, handed both back.
                           "In three days, madam," he said, "perhaps less, I shall have
                              discovered all you wish to know."
                           My spirits rose like an elastic spring, so much did his intelligent
                              manner give me hope. The expression of his face was such a compound of
                              cunning sagacity and ingenuity, I seemed to feel that he was the
                              veritable Asmodeus who could at will lift the roofs off the houses,
                              and peer down into every room with microscopic minuteness and
                              certainty. I felt that no house, where a chance lurked of finding
                              Arthur, would escape him, and, as he went away, I grew so nervously
                              excited and hopeful that my friend, sitting pallid and despairing by
                              the fire, caught the infection, and we both had a comforting,
                              relieving cry together.
                           But oh! those three days—those three endless days of suspense and
                              dread—would they never, never come to an end? What momentary fleeting
                              flushes of hope we had! what long, deadly sinkings of despair! How
                              hard I worked to get the poor, crushed mother to taste food or try to
                              sleep. How wan and woeful she looked, walking the live-long day up and
                              down, up and down, her hands now clasped over her head, now pressed
                              upon her throat to still the convulsive working of the muscles, and
                              constrain the painful, hysterical lumps that choked her. She remained
                              with me, for she could not endure the lonely desolation of her own
                              house; and I, in reply to all pertinent and impertinent questions from
                              the aforesaid friends and relations, gave out that Arthur had gone on
                              a travelling expedition, and his mother, not feeling well, had come to
                              pass the time with me.
                           The days crept lingeringly on. The evening of the third was passing,
                              and we were utterly hopeless and wretched, when there came a quick
                              ring at the bell. My heart leaped in my throat, and my poor friend
                              fell fainting in a chair—she had become so weak with the long-drawn
                              torture of those dreadful days.
                           
                           The servant came into the room, instantly followed by the police
                              captain.
                           "Quick, madam!" he cried to Arthur's mother; "put on your hat and come
                              with me. Don't stop a moment, or you may be too late."
                           His words acted like a spell. "You have found him!" she almost
                              screamed, starting up and clutching at his arm; "Oh, make haste! make
                              haste, and take me to my son—my darling, and may God bless you
                              forever!"
                           "Shall my husband go with us?" said I, trembling violently.
                           "I think not," answered the wise, far-seeing man; "if his mother don't
                              bring him back, no power on earth can save him." He turned away, and
                              touched his face with his coat cuff with a quick, irritated gesture,
                              as if angry at himself. Brave and gentle policeman! One in Heaven saw
                              and registered the tear you wiped away.
                           We hurried on our things, and got into a carriage at the door. Our
                              conductor gave an order, stud with delicate tact would have got upon
                              the box; but I begged him to come inside, and we were whirled
                              away.
                           It was all I could do to keep the poor mother in her senses. I urged
                              over and over how important it was she should control herself. With
                              her arms clasped tight around my neck, her cheek, burning hot, the
                              scalding tears flowing, her breath coming in great gasps, the poor
                              soul prayed aloud for Divine support in whatever might be coming. She
                              implored God to give her back her only child—the child she loved with
                              all her heart and soul and strength.
                           And now we heard from the man that only that day he had discovered
                              Arthur was living in a large, handsome house, far up one of the
                              leading streets in the city. The house was owned and occupied by a
                              beautiful woman upon whose fair fame a dark cloud rested. He had
                              watched the door the whole day, first engaging a hack to stand out of
                              sight round the corner. This proved to have been a most fortunate
                              thought, for in the last half hour a carriage had stopped at the door.
                              Arthur and the woman, with two, others, had jumped in, and had been
                              driven away, he (the policeman) following in the hack until he had
                              seen them stop and enter a house not far from mine; then ordering his
                              man to drive furiously he had come for us.* * *
                           We were now at the door. The other carriage was still waiting. Our conductor, whose
                              life, spent in detecting all kinds of crime, which rendered him steady
                              of nerves indeed, but failed to rob him of a kind and tender heart,
                              helped my friend out, whispering, "Courage, madam! Your son will
                              return to you; he will not refuse his MOTHER;" and we went up the
                              steps and rang the bell. When the door was opened, we did not wait to
                              ask questions but silently and at once entered the front parlor.
                           It was not lighted, and one gas burner in the back room revealed to us
                              a group, standing before a clergyman in Episcopal robes, their backs
                              to us. Great Heavens! what words struck our ears!
                           "I require and charge you both, as ye shall answer at the dreadful day
                              of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that
                              if either of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined
                              together in matrimony, ye do now confess it."
                           He paused—
                           Trembling in every limb, pale as ashes, her eyes dilated and wild as a
                              maniac's, her heart on fire, her arms uplifted, Arthur's mother rushed
                              forward, shrieking, "I—I—know! She is unworthy to be called his wife!
                              Arthur! Arthur! my son! my son!"
                           What a ghastly face he turned upon her! His guilt, vast, unmeasured,
                              rose darkening before him; a shuddering remorse seized him as he
                              looked at her so changed, broken hearted, almost lifeless. He shrank
                              and cowered before this apparition of what was only a few days before
                              his beautiful and happy mother. She seemed to be lying in a new-made
                              grave—a grave he had dug. The unholy love fled swiftly out of his
                              heart, and he saw himself as he was—a monster, a coward, and a
                              fool.
                           Then I heard a low, repentant groan. "Oh mother! darling!" The, next
                              instant she was clasped in his arms, both sobbing, convulsively.
                           I stood bewildered as in a dream. Amazed, almost paralyzed—icy chills
                              coursing each other through my frame, as I witnessed this painful
                              realizing of my strange trance. I stirred not. I seemed turned into
                              stone; when the woman suddenly recognizing me as the one who had
                              warned Arthur against her, came swiftly toward me with the step and
                              spring of a panther, her purple black eyes glaring and hoarsely
                              whispered, "Ah wretch! Is it you? You have driven me away from the gates of Heaven. You are
                              plunging me back into the hell I would have lived down, and so escaped
                              from. Oh woman! woman! on your soul be my future guilt."
                           At these last dreadful words, I seized her hand and cried, "Oh, no!
                              no! not that! see! I implore you; go away from here; there is still
                              happiness, at least there is the peace of sin repented left for you.
                              Go where you are not known, comfort and help the poor, the weak
                              hearted and sorrowful. God will forgive you, He has said to one like
                              you, 'Thy sins, which are many, are forgiven.' Oh go to Him my sister,
                              my poor lost sister; wash His feet with your tears, and He will give
                              you peace."
                           Then I curled my arms round her neck, and pressed my face, wet with
                              tears, against her cheek, and kissed her, murmuring, "Promise me, oh
                              promise me."
                           There was silence for a moment. Then I felt her shrink and tremble;
                              and looking up saw in those beautiful black eyes two big tears; they
                              swelled, brimmed over, and fell like dew from Heaven upon my hand that
                              rested on her neck. Her noble face was now all pale, and unutterably
                              sad. She took my hand, and kissed it with a gentle, humble grace past
                              all description; then lifting from her neck a small black elastic
                              cord, to which was attached an exquisite likeness of Arthur, with one
                              wild sob, one wild pressure of her lips upon the inanimate ivory, she
                              threw it over my head and whispered, "Take this; you have
                              conquered."
                           As she spoke, two more enormous tears welled up and quietly rolled
                              down her pale cheeks. "Will you take a blessing from one so lost as
                              I?" Her very voice was so full of those great pitiful tears; they
                              seemed drowning my heart; I could not answer. I could only kiss her
                              cheek.
                           "Then God bless you—you have spoken the first kind words I have heard
                              from the pure lips of, one of my own sex, since I became the thing I
                              am. God bless you—your husband—your children—for you must have
                              children—or you would not have so loved me. God, bless
                              you on your death bed. Oh! may that be
                              peace!—the peace of God that passeth all understanding. Oh! how well I
                              know the words of that loving benediction. I too, many times, in my
                              far-away innocent days have knelt to hear them. Farewell, Arthur. I
                              thank Heaven you have been saved from sin and me. We shall never meet
                              again."
                           
                           No words can give any idea of the beautiful, sorrowful, loving face
                              she turned upon him; and his was hidden upon his mother's shoulder.
                              With a gasping sigh she bowed her head and murmured, "It is best so,
                              he has forgotten me, while I, already old in agony, must suffer for
                              ever and ever." Then, beckoning to her companions, who had been
                              silent, awe-struck spectators of the sad scene, they followed her out,
                              and a moment after, I heard them drive away.
                           And now I strove to collect my senses, and look about me. The
                              clergyman stood there; fear and misgiving depicted on his countenance.
                              In a few words I explained why all this had passed. The good man
                              listened in terror, and deeply, almost tearfully, expressed his
                              gratitude that he had been prevented in time from completing this
                              disastrous marriage ceremony I could not help commenting with some
                              severity upon the readiness with which ministers married all who came
                              to them, without hesitation or inquiry. I declared it was their solemn
                              duty to investigate, where there seemed a shade of mystery or
                              concealment.
                           He answered with great courtesy that he had received a lesson that
                              evening he hoped he should never forget, and once more thanked God
                              that it had come in time to save so great misery.
                           We went away. Arthur sorrowfully clinging to his mother; her long
                              years of self-sacrificing love crowding upon his memory and swelling
                              his really noble heart with anguish and remorse.
                           Thank God he was saved. To his mother alone he confessed with many a
                              burning flush and struggle his temptation and his weakness. He will
                              never grieve her again. He has torn from his heart those seeds of sin
                              before they had time to take deep root, to be cut down afterward as a
                              tree falling under the axe, leaving him only a blot on the earth.
                           The calm, tender love of a son for his mother keeps watch and ward at
                              the door. That this has cost him many a throe of secret anguish—none
                              who know the almost superhuman temptations besetting a boy of
                              nineteen, with money almost unlimited, to spend in this
                              great and wicked city, will doubt; but it is done; and we all "watch
                              and pray."
                           His mother and I are trying to find some young girl, pure and lovely,
                              that the fading shadow of this unholy passion may be utterly quenched
                              in the brightness of an innocent love. I may succeed; but
                              I don't know about her. I never saw a mother yet who thought any girl, no matter how
                              good and lovely, worthy of her son. They invariably cast a halo of
                              perfection over their male children, and do not love the girls
                              unreasonably. Unfair, but like a woman.
                           
                           Will some psychological reasoner explain to me my trance? And will the
                              photographic artists stop fastening people up in iron vices; which
                              caused me to have the trance; and will the lovely lady, without whose
                                 yard of black silk elastic I should not have been done
                              to death in my trance, come to see me. I think she owes me a visit for
                              the suffering she brought upon me, and I feel we should grow to be
                              good friends. That my curiosity and not the elastic got me into
                              trouble, we will keep in the background. This is all.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               There were a few silent moments. My narrative had saddened them all. At last Harry
                  said, "I have read somewhere, dear aunt, that it is almost certain the longest
                  dream occupies but an instant of time. In your trance the heavy iron falling
                  suddenly, must have struck a nerve so sharply, as to cause physical
                  unconsciousness; while at the same time the intense pain quickened the brain to
                  delirium, in those two awful moments. Then as you entered the photographic rooms,
                  depressed, miserable about Arthur, what you feared for him, took form, mixed
                  strangely enough with all you had seen, talked about, and done while with him and
                  afterward."
               "Yours is a very plausible theory," remarked young Appreciate. "No stupor could
                  utterly deaden the tortured nerve, and the pain distorted and made monstrous the
                  events which lived over again in her brain. But it is a most strange experience!
                  One must believe that a wisdom greater than ours had shaped this dream or trance
                  to its wondrous ending. How without it would the widow's son have been saved? and
                  her heart spared from suffering, for which the world has no name! Who can doubt
                  that He directs all things?" and the young man looked up with a solemn
                  gesture.
               Then his uncle, in an earnest voice, far different from the cynical, loud-scolding
                  one he usually assumed to cover a great kind heart, said, "Ah! what a terrible,
                  fathomless sea is life to him who sails without 'Prudence at the helm,' and
                  religion, pure and simple, for his magnetic guide, with finger pointed to
                  heaven.
               
               "Then dark clouds and wild winds may lower and beat as they will. God be thanked,
                  my dear boy," laying his hand kindly on his nephew's shoulder, "that you learned
                  early to walk in His ways. Your mother, with her last breath, thanked Him for the
                  good son who had never caused her to shed one bitter tear. It is a proud heritage
                  to possess."
               The young man's lip quivered painfully, and his eyes filled with tears. Although
                  three years had passed since he had held his mother's hand, while watching the
                  shadow of death passing slowly down over her beloved face, he could not yet think
                  of her without grief for his great loss. The sound of a bell tolling still caused
                  his heart to beat; he never entered the room which had been hers without a dreary
                  sense of its emptiness; his gentle and loving nature, though ever cheerful, still
                  mourned for his mother.
               Then sweet cousin Adelaide said in a low, musical voice, as if answering her own
                  thoughts, "With pure religion and perfect faith in our Blessed Saviour, life is
                  calm, beautiful, and peaceful. No clouds so heavy, no fateful winds so wild, but
                  that with faith, we may reach our blessed haven at last. Oh, that my dear brother
                  had this faith!" She bent over her netting, and crystal tears fell from her eyes,
                  and dropped upon the gold and crimson threads.
               Poor little heart! Her brother, my brave boy, had gone with the first, to fight,
                  perhaps die, for his country. Loyal, brave, impetuous, there was but one thing
                  wanting; he was not a soldier of Christ. She had given him at their
                  parting, while clinging weeping on his breast, her own little Bible. We could only
                  pray for him now.
               And so it came to pass that my strange story awoke some chord of regret or grief
                  in all our hearts, and we went quietly and somewhat sadly home.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               WE assembled the next evening with considerable curiosity as to who intended to
                  give us the next intellectual feast. We had made no previous arrangement, and were
                  both surprised and pleased when my sweet girl, with many a blush and little
                  coaxing kiss printed on my cheek, produced neat white roll of paper, and begged me
                  to read her "contribution."
               "Not at all!" I cried, hardening my heart. "Every man for himself; woman likewise.
                  So say, 'Ahem,' Addie, and begin."
               "Please, dear mamma," coaxed the young girl, "it is about your aunt, and my great
                  aunt; do dear, I can't."
               "You recant, you mean, you, naughty puss! I never thought you would
                  talk 'cant' about such an unaffectedly good woman as your great-aunt. You should
                  be made to go stand in the corner, till you say you are sorry."
               Upon this, young Appreciate could hold out no longer; but earnestly entreated that
                  he might have the honor, the great pleasure of reading Miss Adelaide's
                  manuscript.
               I cried "No! no!" but was ignominiously voted down; and in a sort of joyful haste,
                  he possessed himself of the paper, upon which her fair small hand had rested; and
                  in a clear and admirable voice, began:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           AUNT MARY,*
                              
                           
                           
                              
                              *Also published in a juvenile, to be called "The Doll's Wedding,
                                 and other Stories." The beautiful, simple, and æsthetic thoughts
                                 which grace this little sketch, will perhaps be more thoroughly
                                 enjoyed "by children of a larger growth." The author has
                                 therefore inserted it here. It was written by her daughter at
                                 the age mentioned above.
                           
                           A SKETCH BY A GIRL OF FIFTEEN.
                           It is my opinion that in spite of my being a very young girl, I might,
                              without exciting much surprise, personate the character of a
                              respectable old lady; for all kinds of antiquities seem to agree
                              extremely well with me.
                           Thus, an old book has a peculiar charm for me; an old dress always sits better than a
                              new one; and certainly everyone will allow that there is no comfort in
                              the world equal to a pair of old slippers.
                           But most particularly am I fond of old ladies and gentlemen, with
                              their quaint; stories of the days when they were young; those magical
                              days, when the sun shone quite differently from now, "so much longer
                              and brighter;" the soft summer breezes were sweeter and cooler, and
                              the winter snows were not the six inch deep affairs we have at
                              present, but were up to the second story windows; then the birds sang
                              far more sweetly than they ever do now-a-days; the peaches were twice
                              as large, the apples three times, and the gentlemen bowed four times
                              lower and twenty times more respectfully.
                           The dearest of all my elderly relatives is my mother's aunt, my
                              great-aunt Mary. I wish you could see her sitting in a corner of the
                              fireplace, in a funny little black rocking chair of hers, that is no
                              one knows how old, with a mosaic patchwork cover on the back, always
                              busy with her knitting or sewing, and just the sweetest, dearest,
                              little old soul in the world; though she is my
                              great-aunt, I am so much larger and stronger, that I
                              could, if I pleased, catch her up in my arm's and run all over the
                              house with her, without her being able to help herself. I mean to try
                              it some time.
                           Aunt Mary's face is wrinkled; but her blue eyes are still clear and
                              bright; her soft gray hair is parted over a placid brow; her smile is
                              very sweet, and her voice so pleasant and kindly, that you feel as
                              though you could never do enough for her, and you love her
                              instinctively the very first time you see her. I believe that is the
                              reason everybody calls her "Aunt Mary." It seems as if they could not
                              help it; but I think it is a great liberty.
                           Aunt Mary is not one of those old old ladies, who think
                              little folks should sit upright on a hard wooden bench, with nothing
                              to rest their poor little spines against, and nothing to do but stare
                              at the fire and twirl their thumbs.
                           She took a great nephew of hers to church, not longs ago; a little bit
                              of a fellow, and I think a perfect darling. Stanny had never been to
                              church before, and he was so surprised with the great painted windows,
                              and the quantity of people, that he sat up, in wondering silence, as
                              grave as a judge; and Aunt Mary was just thinking to herself "How well
                              Stanny behaves! really I am quite proud of him!" when suddenly the
                              organ struck up very loud; and Stanny, well remembering the organs in
                              the street, which he always ran to the window to see, shouted out
                              loud, "Why, Aunt Mary I there's an organ! but where is the
                              monkey?"
                           Of course everybody around laughed; how could they help it? and dear
                              old Aunt Mary, instead of wanting to shake his head off, as some old
                              ladies would, laughed too; but whispered to him to speak more softly
                              next time, and gave him a gum drop out of her pocket.
                           She loves all the children, and is the soul of indulgence to her
                              little nephews and nieces; she don't scold a bit, when they run away
                              with her snuff box, as Fanny and I have often done; although she is
                              naturally very quick-tempered, her patience and forbearance are
                              beautiful to observe.
                           Aunt Mary never uses spectacles; she reads the finest print, and
                              stitches far more neatly than I can, without them; and those faded,
                              but small and pretty hands, have knit more stockings for the poor, and
                              made more patchwork bedquilts than I have time to count.
                           Then she is very lively, and has often made me scream with laughter;
                              her comical expressions, with many a quiet, sly cut at our faults and
                              nonsensical sensical notions, and her funny stories, are far better
                              than the writings of many an author who tries to write as though his
                              fun was not the hardest work in the world for him, instead of coming
                              right from his heart like my dear Aunt Mary's. Time has not soured
                              her, as it does some old people; you never see her going about, with
                              her brows tied up in—oh! such a hard knot! with a querulous moan of
                              "W-h-e-r-e-'s my spectacles? why d-o-n-'t you come and light my fire?
                              who's got my snuff box? oh dear!" Not at all; but it is, "Do let me
                              read you this in the paper," a noble act of heroism or a funny
                              anecdote, that has excited her admiration or laughter; and presently
                              we will all be admiring or laughing with her, to her immense
                              satisfaction.
                           You can't get Aunt Mary to put on a hoop skirt, or wear gaiter boots.
                              She remains steadfastly by her narrow skirts and prunella shoes.
                           Once, as a very great favor, she permitted me to try on a dress of
                              hers, which she wore to her first ball, when she was about sixteen
                              years old. You may imagine what a singular figure I made in it, when I
                              tell you that there were but two breadths in the skirt, and tiny gores
                              at the sides; while the
                              sleeves stood out as though they were lined with buckram, and the
                              waistband was just under my arms. The material was the thickest of
                              white silk, with lovely bunches of roses all over it. You perceive
                              that fashions have changed considerably since she was a girl; and I
                              often think how queer it must seem, for her to look back on all the
                              fashions that have come up since her first ball dress.
                           And now I will tell you something very interesting indeed about Aunt
                              Mary. She has seen the great General Washington alive; and I would be
                              willing to be just as old if I could say the same.
                           Yes, my dear old aunt is of another and past century. It always seems
                              to me as if she should be dressed with the powder, high-heeled shoes,
                              and ruffles of real lace that she wore long ago.
                           But in any dress we shall always love her dearly; for she is to us a
                              kind monitor, a sincere friend, and a simple, earnest Christian, God
                              bless dear Aunt Mary!
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               "Well!" exclaimed Mr. Growler, emphatically, slapping his knee, "That is equal to
                  any paper in 'Addison's Spectator!' It is a beautiful cabinet picture! Miss
                  Adelaide, I am your most obedient humble servant;" whereupon he gravely rose and
                  made her one of the grandest, most elegant bows, I have ever witnessed.
               She started up, and gave him in return a surprised but very fine little courtesy;
                  then, looking in his face, and seeing the broad beams of kindness and admiration
                  in his eyes, she put both hands into his, and somehow or other, the next moment
                  the old gentleman had kissed her blooming cheek!
               We were electrified! and oh! what eyes young Appreciate did make! he looked as if
                  on the point of kissing his uncle to gather the bloom from his lips of which he
                  was sure her cheek had been robbed; or else of giving him a good beating. His eyes
                  flashed; his teeth came together with a snap! his very whiskers curled with
                  indignation and envy; and he muttered, "Confound his impudence!"
               Blush followed blush on our dear girl's face, as we, with eager emulation,
                  following "in the footsteps of our illustrious predecessor," pressed kisses and
                  praises upon her; the first from the little wife and me; the latter from the
                  gentlemen, which were all they dared; for they were afraid if the chuckling
                  self-congratulation of the good old "fossil"—"Some comfort, after all, in being
                  old enough for a
                  grandfather!"—were made the text, or pretext for a similar application on their
                  parts, she would not be able to see it; and they wisely refrained from running
                  their heads into danger. Young Appreciate's biceps muscles were somewhat famous;
                  he really looked dangerous; and for that matter so did she; though scarcely more
                  than a child in years, there was a latent dignity about her girlish person, and a
                  majesty, down deep in her violet eyes, ready to flash lightning at the slightest
                  disrespect. She was a girl who would have extended her fair hand to be saluted,
                  with all the royal grace of a queen, and considered the honor bestowed fully as
                  great; and as to giving her carte de visite to
                  any and every Tom, Dick or Harry who petitioned for it, I well knew that the
                  simple idea was an affront! For this reason and no other, I have not ventured to
                  show you her pictured face: her graceful, girlish form; and the back of her
                  beautiful head, with its soft brown curls, hastily sketched without her,
                  knowledge, as she sat half musing, half reading at the window one day, being the
                  extent of my daring. Dear me! What a laughing, scolding kiss I shall get, when she
                  sees it for the first time in this book!
               I watched young Appreciate the rest of the
                     I have not ventured to show you her pictured face.—p. 176
                  
                   evening in a very unfair and unhandsome
                  manner. I saw him surreptitiously sip, with a beatified aspect, a little chocolate
                  she had left in her cup, pretending in a shame-faced way that he had mistaken it
                  for his own; and looking in her face with an explanatory expression, which ended
                  in one of lingering tenderness; and she, blushed more and more; her violet eyes
                  grew darker and softer, and the dewy bloom, on cheek and lip, deepened under his
                  eloquent eyes, as the roses blush under the warm sun's rays.
               They were certainly a case.
               And the little wife and I had a good long talk about it the very next morning. I
                  rather liked him, I confess.
               I don't know if this incipient love affair had anything to do with it; but Mr.
                  Wilton gravely proposed to give the next story; then he looked at his wife, with
                  such a comical smile that she doubled up her little white hand into a snowball,
                  and threatened him with it, if he dared to tell any stories about her. From this
                  we conjectured that something spicy would be served up at the next meeting; and so
                  we left with the pleasantest anticipations.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               "WELL," said Mr. Growler at our next evening, "if the story to-night is to be a
                  sentimental, lovesick tale, I for one will go walk up and down outside till it is
                  finished. That charming sketch of 'Aunt Mary' fell like dew drops on my heart; and
                  I won't have them scorched up by some horrible love and murder nonsense. Couldn't
                  one of you write a story about a mummy, and leave living persons and feelings to
                  rest for a while?"
               We all laughed, and Harry said, "You have read about the Yankee mummies?"
               "No!" we chimed.
               "Is it possible! I will tell you as well as I can remember; I read the story very
                  long ago, but do not know who wrote it. Well. There is a town very far down East
                  indeed, where the air is so remarkably salubrious that the people cannot die, try
                  their best; they gradually dry up; and their shrivelled faces grow like the walnut
                  dolls you make for pen wipers. When they are so dry that they rattle like paper,
                  they are put separately into bags, and hung up all round the interior of the
                  churches, which is considered nearest to being buried. The summer winds blowing
                  through the churches cause these bags to bounce against each other, and the
                  constant rattling serves to remind the living of what they must come to at
                  last.
               "It so happened that a lawsuit, pending at a certain time, could not be
                  satisfactorily settled because some connecting link was wanting; and this could
                  only be supplied by a good old gentleman who had been bagged and hung up about a
                  hundred years before. What to do they could not tell! At last one of the
                  Down-easters, more enterprising, if possible, than the rest, proposed to take
                  Deacon Dusenberry down, soak him for an hour or two in warm water, and see what
                  would come of it.
               "No sooner said than done. To their astonishment and delight, the old gentleman
                  after a while seemed to soften and spread; then he slowly opened one eye, and
                  perceptibly winked at the company; his other eye seemed considerably tougher, as
                  it remained obstinately shut. Presently his arms flapped up and down, like fins in the water; he
                  lifted his head, and in a cracked, wheezy voice, like the wind whistling through
                  an old pair of bellows, squeaked out, 'Massy sakes! What on airth are ye disturbin
                  of me fur? Speak up spry, or you won't get nothin out o' me, I tell YOU!'
               "Upon that they made short work of the case in hand; the deacon came out
                  splendidly with the ardently-desired information; then telling them to drain him
                  well, to keep him from moulding, they put him in the bag, hung him up again, and
                  there he is peacefully rattling in the breeze to this very day."
               Shouts of laughter, mingled with "O for shame! do stop, Harry! from his wife,
                  greeted this ridiculous narrative, and put us in sympathetic humor to enjoy what
                  was coming, for we saw by Mr. Wilton's mischievous glances, as he unrolled his
                  manuscript, that he had been writing something which somebody would declare he
                  ought not to have written.
               Holding his paper tight in his hands, for fear it might be snatched away, he began
                  by saying, "This story is about a ghost, which I presume Mr. Growler will allow
                  approximates to a mummy story; but a ghost of such a peculiar style, that I was
                  puzzled how to begin my account."
               "At the beginning, I should say," suggested Mr. Growler.
               "Well, I began before the beginning, and have mentioned one or two frisky
                  antecedents of my ghost's, which may amuse you. I call my story
               
                  
                     
                        
                           BE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, THEN FORWARD!
                           LITTLE Mrs. Bell was pretty, witty, and lovable. These two last-named
                              qualities are seldom compatible; for your wit is apt to forget, under
                              temptation, that— 
                                 
                                    "As keenest edge by smoothest oil is whet,
                                    So wit is by politeness sharpest set."
                                 
                              
                           
                           Witty people will make their point, if it is death to
                              their dearest friend; but Mrs. Bell was a loving little creature, and
                              would not harm anything or body by word or deed—except Croton bugs, in
                              which all good housekeepers will applaud her.
                           She was impetuous because she was bright. She was apt to do things
                              with a rush, taking virtue
                              and surrounding circumstances for granted, because she was innocent
                              and unsuspecting. She was just a sweet, little, fascinating woman,
                              continually getting into scrapes and miraculously escaping from the
                              consequences by—how much? by barely the skin of her pretty white
                              teeth—that's not genteel, but at least it is comprehensible.
                           Last winter, while head over ears in work for one of our charity
                              fairs, Mrs. Bell received an invitation from a new acquaintance to a
                              large party given to a bride. She wanted to go very much; she wanted
                              to sell at her table at the fair very much; and she wanted a new dress
                              very much, for she had worn all she had at least twice each, which
                              argued a degree of destitution which is equivalent to a state of
                              fashionable nudity.
                           Let a woman alone for managing! By making love to Madame D., an
                              exquisite dress, all flounce and green wreath, was made—a pretty girl
                              in the establishment, of Mrs. Bell's size, acting as dummy, so that it
                              fitted to distracting perfection without the owner having to try it
                              on.
                           She was to sell at the fair till it closed, at half past ten, then
                              rush home, dress, and off to her party. Capital! what a gay little
                              woman it was! Talk of Mark Antony and his losing the world!
                                 She could have conquered him and his grandfather too
                              in half the time. Any one else would have remained to this day on the
                              thorns or horns (whichever it is) of the dilemma.
                           The night of the party arrived. First, at the fair, the little woman
                              kept a crowd around her, laughing and buying till their pockets were
                              empty. At her side was a beautiful young girl, holding a great "grab
                              bag," but who owed not a little of the unlimited demand upon her
                              hidden wares to the bantering encouragement and mysterious hopes held
                              out by her companion of the immense prize which might possibly be
                              discovered by a persevering, oft-repeated search. She was protection
                              as well as help to the pretty maiden; for, when a handsome,
                              well-dressed, but, impudent young fellow, staring at her with his bold
                              black eyes, inquired, "Have you sweethearts to sell?" Mrs. Bell,
                              quickly, but quietly taking up a doll, answered for her, "Yes. Here is
                              a sweetheart, and here is a puppy;" holding before his
                              face a small hand glass. The puppy walked off, discomfited, with a
                              gleeful ha! ha! and something else in his ear.
                           The evening brightened and waned, mid music, jests, and excitement, and a few
                              minutes after half past ten, Mrs. Bell hurried home, escorted by some
                              friends, who lived in the neighborhood.
                           "Well, Fred," said she to her husband, as she removed her bonnet and
                              cloak, and began to dress for the party; "well Fred, how's the
                              headache? Can't you go with me?"
                           Fred called his head by an opprobrious epithet, vowed the pulses in
                              his temples were beating his brains black and blue, but begged his
                              little wife not to mind him, but for once to go alone.
                           "Oh dear, I can't!" she cried, "I don't want to go without you. What
                              shall I do?"
                           "Do, you little goose? I advise you to go on lacing up those
                              ridiculous little white satin boots. In the first place, I could not
                              find half an inch of room in the carriage, with you and your
                              crinoline; and that extraordinary flourish"—pointing to her dress,
                              which lay on the bed, covering it all over, the innumerable flounces
                              heaped up like a syllabub, "it would be death to crease it and
                              destruction to sit upon it. I should have to follow you in another
                              vehicle. You will be perfectly safe, as the same man will drive you
                              that we have always employed. Don't mind me; I want you to go and
                              enjoy yourself self. Here is my night key; let yourself in, and I will
                              go to bed."
                           Little Mrs. Bell, to oblige her husband, took his advice; to be sure
                              it coincided remarkably with her wishes, by which the wise reader
                              perceives what is the only true way to give advice, and I hope thanks
                              me for the hint.
                           So Fred helped her to dress; and her maid accomplished the intricate
                              lacing up of the flounced syllabub on her round, lithe figure with
                              many a tap of the impatient little foot. Then she was rapturously
                              admired and heartily kissed by her husband, with an "Oh Fred,
                                 do don't! you are crushing my wreath!" (Caresses are
                                 so frivolous and ill-timed, on solemn full-dress
                              occasions.) Then she tripped into the nursery to bend for an instant
                              over little "Pet," otherwise Georgiana, who lay in her crib, dimpling
                              and cooing in her sleep; then down stairs and into the carriage with
                              such admirable strategy that not one furbelow was disturbed. She did
                              not think it worth while to sit down, but did a little
                              Zampilaerostation in the balancing line, for the space of five
                              minutes, at the end of which time the carriage stopped with a jerk,
                              which nearly pitched her over on the top of the precious wreath,
                                 opposite a large brown
                              stone house, one of a uniform row, in Twenty-third street, below Fifth
                              avenue.
                           It was now nearly twelve o'clock. Mrs. Bell, without looking
                              particularly about her, or waiting for the coachman to get down from
                              his box, let herself out, ran up a long flight of steps, and rang the
                              bell. When the door was opened, she did not stop for the stereotyped
                              "Ladies, second floor front," but rushed up stairs, flew along the
                              upper hall, quickly opened the door of the front room, and literally
                              and figuratively flounced in.
                           "Ah! aie!! aie!! e-e-e-e-e!!" shrieked a lady, starting up from a bed
                              in which she was lying.
                           The d——l!" bawled a gentleman, in an inconsiderable Roman tunic, who
                              was standing before a glass, violently brushing his hair with two
                              brushes—right! left! right! left! but now held them aloft, transfixed
                              with amazement.
                           "Ah! oh! murder!!" cried poor little Mrs. Bell. "Where am I?
                              Oh-h-h!"
                           "In my house!" bellowed the gentleman, now sitting on a chair,
                              vehemently dragging the tunic down over his knees.
                           "B-b-b-but," stammered Mrs. Bell, nailed to the spot between confusion
                              and terror, "don't Mrs. Newlady have a party to-night; and isn't this
                              her house?"
                           "No! she lives next d-o-o-r!" cried the angry Roman; the last word
                              ending with a roar, which made the poor little woman jump straight up
                              and down, with a high squeak.
                           By this time the lady in the bed was in fits of hysterical laughter,
                              her face hidden under the counterpane, and Mrs. Bell's obfuscated
                              faculties had waked up sufficiently to enable her to mutter an
                              apology, and carry her out of the room and the house, and up a flight
                              of stone steps precisely like the first she had mounted.
                           When this door was opened, the band playing Mendelssohn's
                              wedding march; the company crowding up stairs to supper; the flowers
                              and perfumes of heliotrope and fried oysters, assured her that this
                              time she was "all right." Throwing her white opera cloak upon her arm,
                              she joined the throng, her little heart still beating tumultuously at
                              the recollection of the extraordinary tableau next door, to which her
                              unexpected advent had given such tremendous effect.
                           She ran into the dressing room, twisted and twirled for a minute before an immense
                              mirror; gave a little twitch to the wreath of feathery hyacinths
                              which, growing on wire, retained all their pristine, make-believe,
                              dewy freshness, and was soon telling her "awful mistake" to a group of
                              friends, who nearly expired with laughter.
                           She had a "splendid time." Eat a little, danced a little, and flirted
                              a great deal. Don't let fly your spiteful arrows at her, Miss
                              Sneering! Wait till you hear my definition of flirting.
                           When the society of a bright, pretty woman, married if you will, is
                              courted by a gentleman, who admires her hugely, but respectfully;
                              enjoys her sparkling, quick repartees, listens with delight to her
                              serious opinions put forth with grave sweetness, high-bred courtesy
                              and almost childish frankness; and declares with the utmost
                              enthusiasm, "by Jove!" and "by George!" that she is worth all the
                              girls he ever saw, because at the same time, with ingenious but
                              innocent wiles she causes him to believe that he says the bright
                              things; whereupon he pulls up his collar, twirls his mustache, and
                              thinks what a deuce of a fine fellow he is—that is what I call
                              "flirting;" and innocent enough it is, for it never gets one
                                 grain further. So, Mr. Greeneye Graspall, accept the
                              reflected compliment upon the taste of your selection, and be
                              thankful; invite young Appreciate to dinner; take wine with him, and
                              have unbounded faith in your wife, for she deserves it; and Miss
                              Snarling, don't trouble yourself to rush about in your bilious,
                              dyspeptic condition from house to house, turning up the whites of your
                              eyes, and ejaculating, "Isn't it awful how that woman flirts!"
                           On the other hand, when a woman, smart, artful as a fox, with sinister
                              intention, coils herself round a silly young coxcomb, plies him with
                              poetry, sighs, and flummery, murmurs in low, thrilling tones, all
                              sorts of nonsense, mixed with blighted hopes, &c.,
                                 she may call it flirting, but I call it
                                 intrigue.
                           Have I made myself understood? or have I, too, some cross, tattling
                              old tabby, puckering up her face like a bag at me and my
                              definitions?
                           Well, never mind! such women as Mrs. Bell live down stupid, malicious,
                              ignorant, ill-natured, little-minded, contemptible people like
                              Sneering and Co., all in good time—though they may gabble ugly things
                              about them, twenty-one to the dozen.
                           There! I feel relieved, and will go back to our little friend,
                              who enjoyed herself heartily as I have told you; and at half past two
                              the next morning, allowed young Appreciate the felicity of helping her
                              on with her opera cloak; got into her carriage full of glee and
                              excitement, and was driven home.
                           Home was in Fifth avenue above Thirtieth street, the middle house of a
                              uniform block. She opened the carriage door, told the man there was no
                              need to ring, as she had a latch key, and tripped quickly up the long
                              flight of steps, while he drove rapidly off.
                           It was a moonless night, and the street lamps at the corners gave a
                              dim, uncertain glimmer. So the little woman fumbled a long time with
                              her key. It did not fit very well, or else the difficulty was because
                              she had never used a latch key before. You see she did not belong to
                              the New York or Union Club; for whose members night keys are an
                              indispensable institution. But at last the door opened; and she sped
                              through the dark hall, and up to her room on the second floor
                              front.
                           She went in noiselessly, so as not to wake poor dear Fred. The room
                              was dark, and the fire out. "Poor fellow," she thought, "the light
                              hurt his head."
                           
                              
                                 Allowed young Appreciate the felicity of helping her on with
                                    her opera cloak.—p. 190.
                              
                           
                           
                           Softly and slowly she found her way to the dressing bureau, between
                              the windows, upon which she laid her fan, pocket handkerchief, and the
                              key; then commenced a slow journey back to a little table near the
                              door, leading into the nursery, where a box of matches was always
                              kept.
                           But what is this?! She came suddenly against a piece of furniture she
                              did not remember as standing in such a position, or indeed being in
                              the room at all. She passed her hand over it. It seemed to be a very
                              small bookcase, or perhaps only a desk. Perplexed, she stood for a
                              moment, wondering if Fred had ordered it home, and it had come late at
                              night after she left. A vague trembling seized her; she thought she
                              would call her husband; but no, that would be cruel, to waken him out
                              of his quiet, refreshing sleep, when he had been suffering so with
                              headache. So she just crept to the bedside and gently touched his
                              face. He seemed to be in a sweet, dreamless sleep, for he never
                              stirred. The touch of the well-known curl on his forehead and the long
                              silken mustache reassured her; and with a sigh of relief, smiling at
                              her causeless fear, and murmuring "All right," she continued her
                              search for the matches.
                           
                           Ah! the little table at last Mrs. Bell put her hand out with a
                              confident flourish. It came with a slap against some porcelain object,
                              which upset with a crash against another, and both clattered down upon
                              the carpet in a general hullabaloo!!
                           "Ai! ai! What the d——l's that?!" cried a strange voice from the
                              bed.
                           Mrs. Bell froze perfectly stiff with terror immediately; and before
                              she had time to scream.
                           "Wh-a-a-t's that?" said the voice again; this time as if the owner was
                              in an ague fit. "Is—it—a—g-h-o-s-t?"
                           My reader perceives that Mrs. Bell had distinguished herself for the
                              second time in one evening—by rushing into the wrong house.
                           Coming slowly out of her almost death-trance of terror with a gasp and
                              shudder, though still in extremity of conscious fright, she heard a
                              dismal groaning a long way under the bedclothes. The man too, was in
                              mortal fear—of—the ghost. One can fight a robber, and rather enjoy the
                              fray, but dragons, hippogriffs, and above all, ghosts!!
                           She looked so like one as her white garments reflected the vague,
                              shadowy light which the distant street lamps gave through the window
                              panes —her arms raised, lifting the opera cloak, which spread out like
                              a wing on either side. Ghostly and ghastly enough!
                           Thank Heaven for the thought! "Doing ghost," might save her! Like a
                              flash of lightning came the recollection of her little Pet's
                              ridiculously correct personation of a character in a play which she
                              had been taken in great grandeur and glory to see at Barnum's Museum
                              the Saturday before; and how with peals of laughter Fred and she had
                              coaxed the chubby little thing, ten times a day, to strike an
                              attitude, take a tragedy stride, and ejaculate in a deep, hollow
                              voice, "I AM THE ANGEL OF DEATH!"
                           Mrs. Bell must go past the bed to recover the night key. Stilling her
                              throbbing pulses with the determination of despair, the brave little
                              woman commenced her high-tragedy stride, which consists of placing one
                              foot at the greatest possible distance in advance of the other, and
                              dragging the other up as if there was a fifty pound weight tied fast
                              to it, and repeat at every step.
                           Three strides—and a deep, sepulchral voice sounded close to the bed,
                              "I AM THE ANGEL OF DEATH."
                           
                           He clutched violently at the bedclothes, appalled by the grim phantom
                              which his imagination, helped, as it appeared, by his conscience,
                              pictured to him; and in a kind of hysterical hurry he gibbered
                              out—
                           "Oh Lord! O spare me! I will repent! I'll go to-morrow and give Sam
                              Noddy his money! I did sell his stocks in Wall street and
                              keep half of the proceeds. I did draw the money placed in
                              my care, out of one bank in gold; sell the gold and deposit it in
                              bills, in another, pocketing the difference! I did cheat
                              Fitznoodle a little at cards at the club the other night. Oh! Oh! I'll
                              make it up to him and everybody! I'll lead a new life! I will! I will
                              indeed! if you'll only let me live a little longer!"
                           Dead silence.
                           Mrs. Bell had grasped the pocket handkerchief and night key; and was
                              now preparing to go back. With almost superhuman courage she had
                              turned and steadily recommenced her slow high-tragedy stride past the
                              bed again. The man with a desperate hope that he had been mad or drunk
                              or dreaming, still holding the bedclothes tight in one hand, had
                              cautiously poked out his head, and was peeping through the fingers of
                              his other hand in a frenzy of fear at the awful apparition.
                           As she approached, he curled himself up into a ball, and squeaked out
                              in a voice between colic and collapse, "Oh do—n't! I will
                              repe—nt!"
                           But the relentless ghost moaned forth, "I AM THE ANGEL OF RETRIBUTIVE
                              JUSTICE!" which last awful announcement caused the victim to bring his
                              cranium with a tremendous whack against the headboard, shoot his legs
                              straight down to the bottom of the bed, and become so absorbed in the
                              achieving of a succession of hideous squawks, that under cover of them
                              Mrs. Bell got safely past him, out of the room, down the stairs, and
                              out of the house, leaving the front door wide open.
                           She rushed breathlessly up the next flight of steps; the right ones
                              this time; opened the door readily with the night key, though
                              trembling in every limb; shut and locked it, and darted up the second
                              floor front, where a cheerful fire was burning, the gas lighted, and
                              her husband in bed indeed, but keeping awake to welcome her.
                           Down went the poor little soul on her knees by his side; and hiding
                              her face on his breast, treated him to the most tremendous fit of
                              hysterics on record!
                           
                           You may well believe that it took no end of sal-volatile, coaxings and
                              kissings, before little Mrs. Bell could utter an articulate word. It
                              was such a mixture of sobs, sighs, and syllables, that it might as
                              well have been heathen Greek for all he could make of it. But the
                              comedy and tragedy came out at last, and roars of laughter from Fred,
                              mixed with grateful ejaculations and thanks to the Power which had
                              watched over his heedless little wife, in what might have been her
                              deadly peril, subdued the hysterics to a few quiet, thankful tears,
                              trembling smiles and sighs of comfort from the poor little heart.
                           Pet was pulled out of her crib, and kissed and hugged awake, laughing
                              and dimpling all over at the joke, whatever it was. Then she was
                              coaxed to do "the Angel of Death," in her funny, baggy little night
                              drawers, and was informed that she was her mother's "Preserver," which
                              mysterious epithet she concluded meant all the same as "Pet," and
                              received accordingly with an immense number of chuckles and leaps, and
                              immediately volunteered half a dozen repetitions of her ghostly role;
                              every one finished off with three small kicks in the air, and a
                              rollicking, musical little burst of baby laughter, which made the
                              whole thing so excessively comic that Mrs. Bell's third entertainment
                              quite transcended the other two; and you may bet your life that Pet's
                              tableau was far more to her mind than the gentleman's in the very
                              short Roman tunic or the gentleman's in the very tall ghost
                              fright.
                           She had left her fan behind her; but it is needless to say that she
                              never sent for it. The gentleman who made his ghost such dangerous
                              confessions has it now, and it renders him monstrously uncomfortable.
                              He swears at it. The sight of it fills him with fury. He would give
                              four times the money he cheated Sam Noddy out of, if he could discover
                              to whom it belonged. He is afraid to inquire. It is an inscrutable
                              mystery to him, for he boards in a house exclusively for gentlemen.
                              Mrs. Bell, however, has found him out; for of course she
                              planted herself the next morning after her exploits, at one of the
                              front parlor windows, the blinds closed, save just an atom of an
                              aperture, and not a soul came out of the next door that she did not
                              scan with anxious eyes. One came at last, slowly stepping, looking up
                              and down in a worried manner, with—"Good Heavens!" the same round curl
                              on his forehead that Fred had, only jet black, while Fred's was light brown, and
                              twisting spitefully a long silken jet-black mustache! Another look
                              and—"Good Heavens" again! (she makes these exclamations;)
                              it is the "puppy" who was impudent to the pretty maiden at the fair.
                              No wonder he was a coward! and afraid of ghosts! Such heroes always
                              insult timid women, and are utterly put to the rout by brave ones; not
                              to speak of a spook, striding at him in the dead of night, to fly away
                              with him, soul and body.
                           Our impudent, cowardly, fashionable hero, since his terrible fright,
                              never imagines that one of his fashionable lady friends looks at him
                              at all particularly, without the hair rising up on his fashionable
                              head, and the joints at his knees getting loose and shaky; then he
                              goes home and swears in impotent rage at: the fan, and wishes the d——l
                              would fly away with the woman who owned it.
                           Fred has had an old, but useful proverb handsomely engrossed in large
                              capitals, surrounded with miraculous flourishes, and prettily framed
                              and glazed. It hangs in his 'house over the mantelpiece of the second
                              floor front, and reads thus:
                           BE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT—THEN FORWARD!!
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               "Forward!" repeated Mrs. Wilton, imitating the high-tragedy stride, "I am once
                  more the Angel of retributive Justice," and she fell upon her
                  laughing husband with such a shower of little innocent poundings from those two
                  small white snowballs, with which she had threatened him the week before, that we
                  all laughed till we cried, and never went to the rescue.
               So it was all true! and much did we aggravate the pseudo ghost by gravely desiring
                  to know how she had lived through it all! begging her husband to tell us some more
                  of her adventures; for we were certain that she had had scores, just as comical
                  and tragical; whereupon, in spite of her doing her utmost to prevent him, he told
                  us that only the day before he had gone into a store with her to look at some
                  stereoscopic pictures; that a very handsome man, whom they knew only by sight, was
                  standing near the same counter; and that he (Mr. W.) had moved away, while his
                  wife was absorbedly gazing at one of the pictures. Then she deliberately edged
                  herself nearer the very handsome man, still looking at the picture, placed her
                  hand on his arm, pressed it, and softly said, "Dear Fred, is not that gentleman
                  the handsome Mr. Rubelle?"
               
               Of course she got no answer; and looking up, with a jump and a little scream, saw
                  that she had been telling Mr. Rubelle himself how handsome he was. "She keeps me
                  very busy," he continued, with a mock sigh, "making apologies of all sorts and
                  sizes, and getting her out of sudden and unexpected difficulties."
               Sweet cousin Adelaide never could bear to see any one teazed: so she glided round
                  to Mrs. Wilton, curled her arm about her waist, and murmured with her sweet
                  song-voice in her ear, "Never mind, dear, your always mean right."
                  This seemed a simple remark enough; but if you could have seen her charming face
                  as she, spoke, beaming charity, which is love, in its broadest, purest sense, you
                  would at once have understood the superlative comfort Mrs. Wilton found in the
                  young girl's words, and highly applauded the cordial kiss given in return.
               The next moment these two had made the wretch, Wilton, get down on his knees—they
                  standing over him, terrible and beautiful, their eyes flaming wrath, their forms
                  dilating with majestic indignation and confess his ineffable, baseness in making
                  an amusing story out of his wife's sufferings to which confession, irresistibly
                  ludicrous to the rest of us, they listened with a lofty deprecating air, until he
                  began to sob, with the half of his face nearest to them buried in his pocket
                  handkerchief, the other half making absurd faces at us—then, fearing for their
                  gravity they grandly forgave him on condition that he would never do so any more
                  "'pon honor!"
               As to young Appreciate, he would gladly have exchanged places with Mr. Wilton, and
                  would never have risen from their feet until he had obtained not only their
                  gracious pardon, but the additional boon from one of them of her most precious
                  love.
               The little wife hastened to order in the chocolate and sandwiches after all this
                  excitement, as Mr. Wilton declared himself faint, and very much bruised bodily, by
                  the dreadful pummelling he had received.
               How like children we all acted that evening! I verily believe the men would have
                  enjoyed a game at leap-frog, and we women would have accepted plums and tarts out
                  of their pockets, as we did from our boy lovers, when we were eight and ten years
                  old. Who could help being happy with three such darling blooms of women, as the little wife, Mrs.
                  Wilton, and cousin Adelaide! Of course poor old I must be left out; but I could
                  look at the rest, thank Heaven! without envy. Even the "old fossil" had plenty of
                  sunshine remaining in his heart, in proof of which, I solemnly aver that he did
                  not turn up his nose once at anybody or anything after the refreshments came
                  in.
               I walked close behind young Appreciate that evening as he waited upon cousin
                  Adelaide home, which devoted attention had got to be a regular thing, I own I
                  meanly listened, and heard him earnestly expatiating on what a seventh heaven, the
                  true love of one he dared not mention would be to a lonely, motherless fellow; and
                  how he longed to give all the devotion of his heart to this pure and lovely
                  creature, for whom no language had sufficient wealth of words to adequately
                  describe her perfections. She was one for whom he would sacrifice his life's
                  happiness to save her from an hour's suffering.
               And plenty more of the same. Take courage, Appreciate! Her eyes were bright as you
                  spoke with two great heart jewels—tears of joy. It is true she did not answer a
                  word, perhaps that was because she could not. Never you mind! already in your hand
                  is the key of that heart, "so innocent-arch, so cunning-simple."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               THE streets were white with snow. Sleety rain, mingled with great feathery flakes,
                  still fell; the first, in long slanting lines, the others dancing in the wind as
                  it roared sobbed, and moaned in fitful changes.
               But we were all at our pleasant rendezvous, bringing in the wild wind and plenty
                  of snowflakes as the little wife's hospitable door was opened.
               "Rare and true friends!" exclaimed Harry, shaking hands vigorously all round,
                  while his wife pressed her warm rosy lips to our chilled cheeks—take care! I mean
                  to Mrs. Wilton's, cousin Adelaide's, and mine. "Rare and true friends, to come
                  wading through the storm! I have found out one of the 'hidden uses' of the
                  winter's frost. Verily it causeth the fire of friendship to grow brighter and
                  warmer. As I heard the hail beating against the windows like the tap, tap, tapping
                  of a bird of ill omen, I said you would not; come, I doubted, because
                     I was unworthy. Welcome all of you!"
               "Ugh!" growled Mr. Growler, "the tip of my nose is frozen."
               "Dear me! what a calamity!" said Mrs. Wilton. "I'm sure if you ask her in your own
                  irresistible way, cousin Adelaide will knit you a little red woollen bag to tie it
                  up in. It would be such a pity to lose it!"
               "Did you ever in your childhood, ma'am, go to a school where the punishment for
                  foolish talking was to cut a slit in a long piece of whalebone, and insert therein
                  the tip of the offending tongue?"
               "Why, no!" answered Mrs. Wilton, looking innocent, "did you?"
               "Don't mind Uncle Growler, dear Mrs. Wilton," cried young Appreciate, "don't you
                  see the dimple in his chin? that is an infallible index of a tender and most
                  loving heart."—I may as well mention here that Appreciate had a magnificent dimple
                  in his chin, and this may account for the fact that while, Mrs.
                  Wilton looked sceptical upon the cleft-chin argument, cousin Adelaide, blushing
                  like a rose, said it was quite an astonishing coincidence.
               
               A sudden gust of frozen rain, rattling like shot against the window panes, caused
                  us all to draw nearer the cheery soft coal fire, with a feeling of delicious
                  comfort.
               "I thought to have had my translation of the 'Marble Bust' ready by this evening,"
                  said Harry; "but the fact is, one evening during the past week I had to make a
                  kite for my nephew and namesake, who danced round the room, yelling with
                  impatience till it was done. The next evening he came again, and introduced his
                  particular friend Phil, a great lubberly lolipop-eating urchin, and insisted that
                  I should make him one also, instanter, as his (Harry's) kite had gone
                  up into the empyrean in such 'slap-up' style, as to cause his stay upon earth,
                  while he held the other end of the string, to be a succession of frantic
                  struggles, ecstatic capers, and sudden, violent bounces in the air. 'Why, uncle
                  Harry,' he bawled, 'I had to get the coachman to wind her up for me. She's a
                     satirical kite, I tell you!! and Phil wants one just like her.' No
                  use saying 'no' to such customers, so I made the kite, with both boys upsetting
                  their chairs every five minutes by starting up, as if there had been gunpowder
                  fired off underneath them, to look over my shoulder to see if I was 'most
                  done'—and my little wife looking on, laughing at all three of us, declaring it was
                  'so lovely' to see boys so happy. Lovely, indeed! My little rosebud Carrie is
                  worth a million of them!"
               "Darling!" ejaculated the little wife, with beaming eyes.
               "Which?" inquired Harry; "Carrie or I?"
               "Divide it between you," she answered, blushing and smiling. "Now let's have some
                  serious conversation this evening."
               "W-h-e-u-g-h," whistled Mr. Growler. "Have you a gun in the house, Harry, to
                  'shoot folly?'"
               "Meaning me, dear sir?" asked Mrs. Wilton, with a dainty little courtesy, a
                  smiling mouth, but an ominous eye-flash. Then, something strange happened; her lip
                  trembled, the fire went out of her eyes, and two great tears rose up and
                  reproached him.
               Oh then! the dimple, that infallible outward sign of a tender heart, nobly
                  asserted itself. Mr. Growler arose hastily, his face flushing, took her hand, and
                  said in a marvellously soft voice for him, "Don't mind an old crosspatch, my dear,
                  don't you know even the devil is not as black as he's painted. You'll really make me miserable if you
                  ever pay the slightest attention to my growling again. I don't mean it for you, or
                  anybody in particular; it's chronic; I should snarl at you all the same if you
                  were a saint, which you are not, or an angel, which you are, for I see you are
                  going to kiss and make up, instead of flying at me like a royal Bengal tigress, as
                  I deserve," and he actually bent down his gray head and kissed her cheek. Cunning
                  old Growler!
               Pretty Mrs. Wilton at this turned her head half away, but held out her hand with a
                  bright smile, and the soft warm grasp of the little white fingers told him peace
                  was restored. Generous little woman! I said in the beginning of this veracious
                  history that she was a vixen. I told a fib. She is the cream of tartar, covered
                  with sweetness.
               The rain seemed to increase, and the wind howled venomously. I had put a
                  manuscript in my pocket, ready for emergencies. The circumstances mentioned in it
                  seemed peculiarly apropos to this night of snow and frost, so I said, by way of
                  introduction, "Do you remember, dear, my husband's handsome cousin Miranda?"
               "Certainly," answered the little wife. "Who could forget such a noble-looking,
                  lovely old lady? The evening Harry and I dined with her at your house was rendered
                  delightful by her original and bright sayings."
               "Yes," said Harry, "she is a glorious old lady, with her large warm heart looking
                  straight out of her beautiful eyes. I own I fell violently in love with her, and
                  asked her to adopt me."
               "And what did she answer?" I asked.
               "She said she rather guessed I was under pretty good training already, and she
                  calculated one thumb was quite enough to be under at a time. When my wife
                  complained I was getting beyond her, she'd take me in hand."
               "And I'll warrant you would be brought up in the way you should go, then, if ever,
                  to a mathematical certainty. And now about this story. She told me the first
                  evening she came, of a girl's frolic of her's, which made a strong impression upon
                  me; doubtless half of it was owing to the sparkling, vivid manner with which she
                  always speaks. Bless her kind heart! Even at table, if you only request her to
                  hand you the salt, her "certainly I will," is said in such a heartful
                  way, that you can't help feeling more than commonly thankful. She keeps me in a glow of affection for
                  her every moment she is with me. She cheers, comforts, and advises me. In spite of
                  her plain, homely words, many grave men are glad to ask her advice and abide by
                  it. Her keen perception and rare common sense come by nature; and thus it is, that
                  beneath that Yankee dialect, all she utters is to the point and from the
                     point; to the purpose and from the purpose."
               "Is she a widow?" asked Mr. Growler, gravely.
               "This many a year," I answered.
               "If your story comes up to your description, I shall propose," said Mr.
                  Growler.
               At this we all burst out laughing, and were immensely amused, when sweet cousin
                  Adelaide crept like a little mouse close to him, and putting the palms. of her
                  hands together, pleaded, "I thought you meant to ask me, sir?"
               "So I do, saucebox!" he said, catching her hands, and holding her fast; "so I do,
                  not for myself, but for one of my family."
               Bushels of roses!! how the blushes came at that! pouring in a lovely crimson tide
                  over face and neck, and down to her pretty finger tips. She struggled to get away;
                  and young Appreciate darted to hand her a chair and seat himself beside her. I do
                  verily believe if his uncle had asked him then and there to go to the moon and
                  fetch him from thence a pound of green cheese, he could and would have done it!
                  What a darling old uncle it was, to be sure! What an angelic young girl! The very
                  air vibrated with joy.
               "Quite time," quoth I to myself, "for common sense and cousin Miranda." So I took
                  them out of my pocket, and calling "attention" in such a peremptory tone that it
                  brought young Appreciate back from elysium, I began:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           COUSIN MIRANDA.
                           I was sitting by my fireside one winter's afternoon; my half-dreaming
                              thoughts radiating like a star, earthward to the many disappointments
                              and few joys of the past, and Godward, I humbly trust, with prayerful
                              resolutions to do His work better in the future.
                           Two of my children were with me; they were girls; but none the less
                              "my jewels;" for Adelaide, the elder, in all her sweet fifteen years
                              had never given me one disrespectful word; and Alice, "little Allie," though a spitfire,
                              a perfect little tornado of fury and passion, on the least occasion,
                              had a trick, when her rage was over, of looking out of her large dark
                              gray eyes with so pleading a "forgive me" that it was no manner of use
                              to try to resist her bewitchments; and, sooth to say, I never did try,
                              but simply loved her to her hurt, soul and body.
                           Her nose was nothing particular; her saucy mouth had a wry twist,
                              comical enough, and her little skimpy wig was of an underdone brown;
                              but those eyes! they always did the business! and I would clutch her
                              and kiss her till she screamed with pain, and never a word about her
                              badness. Heaven forgive me! I couldn't help it.
                           Well, we three were sitting quite still. Adelaide, as you know, is
                              naturally a thoughtful girl, and Alice makes believe once in a while.
                              The gorgeous red light of the sun's last rays was fast fading, when
                              there came a quick knock at the door.
                           I felt annoyed at the interruption, and gave permission to enter in a
                              grumbling, sleepy voice. Upon this something breezy and cheery seemed
                              to fill the room. I felt myself kissed heartily on both cheeks; then
                              Adelaide and Alice, and then I saw it was cousin Miranda from
                              Connecticut, who had evidently come to make me a visit, carpet bag,
                              new cap, knitting and all.
                           How handsome she was! With her sixty-five years resting so lightly on
                              her smooth brow and shapely shoulders, she could fitly have
                              represented a noble Roman matron, saved from the ruined past, to show
                              us how grand women looked in those days. Far above the ordinary
                              standard height, cousin Miranda was as graceful as every little woman
                                 ought to be, and few very tall women ever
                                 are. Her beautiful wavy brown hair would
                              curl, all she could do, in great smooth rings on either side of her
                              face and her hazel eyes were so inwardly luminous, it seemed highly
                              probable that when a girl, she had coaxed away two of his brightest
                              beams from the sun, and held them prisoned ever since.
                           Cousin Miranda talked Yankee fashion; but, bless your heart! that was
                              the best of it.
                           "Well," said she, taking off her cloak and bonnet, and laying them on
                              the bed in her quick, smart way; and whipping her knitting out of her
                              pocket, and beginning to knit as if the stocking had got to be
                              finished right out of hand. (So it had! it was for the soldiers.) "Well, I don't see
                              but you're about as good and pretty all on you, as ever."
                           "And you are perfectly splendid," I returned, feeling quite
                              heavenly-minded again, "and I am right glad to see you."
                           So I was.—Under affidavit.
                           "I knew you would be," she answered, in her honest,
                              cheery way, "so I thought I'd come and stay a spell with you, before I
                              went home to Litchfield. I have been here some weeks over to Brooklyn
                              staying with my daughter, who has just the nicest husband, and
                              dearest, cutest children I ever see. I've enjoyed my visit wonderful,
                              'specially Sabbath days. I like all the meetin' houses, and all the
                              preachin'."
                           "Did you go to all in turn?"
                           "Why, yes. You see in the morning I went with my daughter to hear the
                              Rev. Mr. Littlejohn. They're pretty high strung there; and I never
                              know where in the world to look for the place in the prayer book.
                              Couldn't follow the singing, neither; 'taint nothing like 'China,' or
                              'Haddam,' and those nice old Connecticut tunes; but most all chantin',
                              as they call it. But this don't make no sort of difference in the
                              edifying of it, if you feel right; because the pasture is in real
                              earnest, and preaches from his innermost heart. He lifts me up
                              wonderful, and I'm glad I've set under his preachin'. But I declare
                              for't! I was took aback one morning, when I saw our
                              little Willie, not only bowing e'en-a-most double at the creed, but
                              a-crossing himself just like the Romans! That was clean past me! and I
                              put a stop to it pretty quick; I can't conceive, nohow, where he
                              learned such a thing, though he is a most curous smart little chap,
                              and picks up all sorts of queer sayin's and doin's.
                           "Then in the afternoon I went to hear Mr. Van Dam—I mean Mr. Van Dyke,
                              who writ the sermon about how glorious 'twas for us to be free, and
                              livin' in the Land of Liberty, and how beautiful 'twas for the colored
                              folks to be slaves. Mr. Van Dyke is a white man, so I reckon he can't
                              calkilate for the colored folk's side, as fair as he can for his'n. If
                              there could be a turn about, and he was a slave, I'd like to know what
                              kind of a sermon he'd write then. That's all!
                           "But the very best time of all is the evening. Then I go to hear Ward
                              Beecher. Last Sabbath night he preached about Charity; gave it to them
                              right smart; said some of them were real stingy, and wanted a sight of stirrin' up.
                              'Now,' says he, 'you old fellows in front, I see very well by the cast
                              of your expressions, that you're feelin' mighty good, and like as not
                              saying to yourselves—"My sakes! ain't he givin' it all killin' sharp
                              to those rich old curmudgeons a few seats back." You think so, do you?
                              Well you just turn round and look a few seats back, and you'll see
                              that those very chaps are puckering up their mouths and grinning, to
                              hear what a fine shakin' down you're havin'.'*
                               Oh I do like to hear him hold forth! if any sinner can hear
                                 him without comin' to a realizing sense, I'll give it
                                 up! that's all!"
                           
                              
                              *A fact, somewhat differently worded.
                           
                           "Why, cousin Miranda! What a good woman you are, to go to church three
                              times a day!"
                           "Yes I am good," she laughed, "but you see it takes three
                              ministers to keep me so. Mr. Beecher does most of all. I only wish
                              he'd had the settlin' of the old deacon who traded horses down in
                              Vermont."
                           "Why, what did he do? cousin Miranda."
                           "Well, you see, Deacon Jabe Sniffin thought he'd experienced a change
                              of heart; but he didn't want to experience a change of business; that
                              was touchin' a tender pint; might interfere with the profits; so he
                              thought he'd consult with Deacon Aminidab Tweedle, who kept store, and
                              fixed the sugar over night.
                           "'Now look here; you don't s'pose, brother Tweedle' he began, 'you
                              don't s'pose them little stories—sort-o'-lies like—that you and I tell
                              in the way of trade, will be reckoned agin us, in the Day o' Judgment?
                              Sarcumstanced as we are, we carn't help it, you know; I
                              don't s'pose it makes no sort o' difference in the sight of the Lord,
                              long's the heart's all right; now does it, brother
                              Tweedle?'"
                           We laughed heartily at this anecdote, enhanced as it was by the gleams
                              of fun that came sparkling through the crystalline clearness of cousin
                              Miranda's handsome eyes; and then I said with a latent intention of
                              coaxing another story from her, perhaps some adventure of her
                              girlhood, "What a real old-fashioned snow storm we've had; the
                              sleighing must have been nearly as good as it was in your young days.
                              I suppose you had no end of sleighing frolics then?"
                           "Well, yes," she answered, while some memory of the past, caused the
                              color to deepen on her cheek, which, even at her age, was rose-tinted
                              and waxen in texture (for cousin Miranda is none of your sallow low, saleratus-poisoned
                              country women), "Well, I've more 'n half a mind to tell you what came
                              of a famous sleigh ride I had once."
                           "Oh, do! do!" we all chimed; and spread ourselves out, skirtwise and
                              brainwise, to enjoy it the better.
                           The bright blue knitting needles clinked and twinkled in the
                              firelight, as she straightened herself up the twentieth part of an
                              inch more than she was before (for let me tell you, of arm chairs and
                              rocking chairs she would none, but always sat up grand and stately,
                              the handsome old dame!) and then she began:
                           "Well, one bright morning I got a letter from uncle ——, your husband's
                              father, dear, inviting me over for a visit. He couldn't come after me
                              himself, he wrote, but Squire Mead, who brought the letter, was the
                              first deacon in his meetin' house, and awful smart in settin' things
                              to rights; and had quite a gift at leadin' on lectur evenings—and he
                              guessed—uncle did—that the squire could take one young gal a journey
                              of eighteen miles safe enough, if he was spry about it.
                           "'Land-o'-Nod!' I thought, 'I guess I can take care of myself most
                              time's.' Well, mother said I might go; and I ran up chamber and fixed
                              myself right smart; and didn't forget to put in my trunk the book
                              muslin gown I'd worn at Lucindy Peck's apple paring, and Clarrissy
                              Bush's quilting frolic, none the worse for them; and then Squire Mead
                              tucked me up in the buffalo, and another put a hot brick to my feet,
                              and we started for our winter's ride.
                           "At first I was kinder nervous and silly; and I guess the Squire, with
                              all his leadin' of lectur meetins', felt skeery, and din't know how to
                              begin the talk; so I put in, 'Havin' pretty good times down to your
                              place, I shouldn't wonder?'
                           "'Oh my, yes! I guess so,' he answered, quite relieved, 'I wish to
                              goodness Miss Briggs you'd a-come last week. You see trade's rayther
                              dull now, and we've gone and got up a grand sleighing party for
                              to-morrow, twenty-five couple! all in one-horse cutters! and coming
                              home in the moonlight. Consarn it!' he continued, looking awful
                              worried, 'there aint a young man left! I'm a mind to hev out the
                              two-horse sleigh, and take you myself, long with my wife.'
                           "Did you ever! I stiffened up and said, 'I calkilated I'd about as
                              many sleigh rides as I wanted to home, and I didn't care nothin' at
                              all in the world about going; shouldn't know none of the folks, and I
                              hoped for the land's sake he'd make no change for
                              me.'
                           "By this time we'd got to the half-way house, for the Squire drove
                              like Jehu. We stepped out of the sleigh and I went into the livin'
                              room to' warm myself. Sittin' by the fire was as likely lookin' a
                              young man as ever I see. He rose up and made me such a beautiful
                              genteel bow! you've no idee! and just then Squire Mead comin' in, he
                              rushed up to him and the Squire cried out, 'Why lawful sakes! Seth
                              Lee, I declare on't! When did you git back from South
                              Ameriky?'
                           "'Just come, Squire.'
                           "'No! How do you do?'
                           "'First-rate.'
                           "'Du tell! Well! This is Miss Briggs." Upon that he made me another
                              beautiful bow; and I had concluded that he was Deacon Lee's only son,
                              I had heard tell on, who had gone away to seek his fortune. Deacon Lee
                              kept the half-way house, you see; and that was how Seth came to be
                              settin' there so comfortable.
                           "'Well,' said Squire Mead, 'I s'pose you
                                 THE HALF-WAY HOUSE.
                              
                               wouldn't care to jine our
                              sleighing party to-morrow and have Miss Briggs for your pardner?'
                           "'Oh yes,' he answered, looking at me, and speaking up quickly; 'it
                              would make me extremely happy if Miss Briggs would honor me so
                              fur.'
                           "This, you see, was his travelled way of speaking, and I declare
                              for't, it sounded beautiful! So I said, 'Well, if you don't mind
                              riding nine miles before daylight to git me, and will be to uncle's by
                              half-past seven, I'm agreeable.'
                           "'I shouldn't think nothing of twice nine miles,' said he.
                           "Well I never! I turned as red as a beet at that I know,
                              and hurried out to the sleigh; but he would help me in;
                              and he would wrap me up in the buffalo; and he
                                 would run in and get the hot brick, and fix it very
                              particularly square under my feet; and I wished him to Guinea, that's
                              a fact!"
                           "But why, cousin Miranda?"
                           "Because I was sure Squire Mead would plague ne all the rest of the
                              way; and so he did, advising me to give the mitten to my last beau and
                              keep company with Seth Lee. He was real aggravatin'!
                           "At last we got to uncle's, and he came to the gate to help me, out, kissing me and
                              saving, 'Well, Mirandy, I don't see as you've been pining. Your cheeks
                              are as red as roses, and your eyes bright as new buttons; but good
                              land! you're way behind the lighthouse this time. Seems to me, when
                              the sky rains porridge your plate's always upside down,' and then he
                              began to tease me about the grand sleigh ride that was to come off,
                              and wish to goodness he was a young man for my sake!
                           "'Oh, now don't you bother, uncle!' said I; 'Maybe I know—ahem! Come
                              now! I'll bet all the loose change in my pocket against a new gown
                              from you, that I lead the party to-morrow morning.'
                           "'Land o' Liberty! how can you,' cried uncle, 'when there
                              ain't a horse nor a cutter, nor a young man left in the hull
                              village.'
                           "'Never you mind,' said I, 'only have the gown ready; I shouldn't
                              object to a laylock ribbon with it.'
                           "So I slipped round, and set the table and made the tea, and helped
                              aunt all I could; and then I went up stairs and unpacked my trunk, and
                              took out the book muslin gown and trimmed it up real fine, with some
                              blue ribbons (and it set like a dandy, I can tell you!) and when uncle
                              came up to see why on earth I stayed away so long, I just showed it to
                              him, and set him laughing like all possessed, to see how I kept up the
                              joke about going—I looking as innocent, all the time, as a
                              two-week-old lamb.
                           "After tea we set round talkin' over all the folks; and then we had
                              some nuts and cider, and pretty soon I lighted my candle to go to bed.
                              Uncle couldn't help poking a little more fun at me—he was a mortal
                              tease—so he said, 'I'm awful sorry, Mirandy, you've been a-doin' such
                              a numerous number of things, all for nothin'—it's too bad! but then
                              you needn't be noways perticler about getting up early in the mornin',
                              as there'll be no cutter at the gate.'
                           "'S'pose you get up early to make sure of it,' I said,
                              laughing, as I ran up stairs.
                           I was stirring bright and early, or rather dark and early the next
                              morning, for the sun was still sleeping. I heard uncle raking out the
                              ashes in the room below; and I laughed as I dressed to think that my
                              time for poking fun was nearly come—the—dear me, had come! for I heard
                              that moment the bells ringing out a sweet little jubilate in the cold,
                              clear air; and running to the window, I saw just the cutest little cutter at the gate,
                              the first beams of the sun shining on it; and giving a pretty faint
                              rose-color to the snow, which lay upon hill and valley, and made all
                              the land look like a great billowy white ocean."
                           (Cousin Miranda was really poetical here.)
                           "Out jumped Seth Lee, as spry as a squirrel; and down stairs I flew,
                              for I was all ready with the book muslin gown and blue ribbons, well
                              covered up with a great cloak; tapped uncle on the shoulder as he
                              stood at the door with his mouth so wide open with astonishment that
                              he couldn't get a word out, and said, "Don't forget an extra yard or
                              so when you trade for that gown, I'm a pretty t-a-ll girl, more ways
                              'n one, don't you think,' jumped into the sleigh, and was off.
                           "And I DID lead the party. I had a grand day, for my partner was just
                              as polite as ever he could be; and when we got to the first stopping
                              place, which was a great iron foundery we were to examine, the whole
                              party were all but crazy with fun; and Seth helped it on
                              wonderful.
                           "He got the foundery men to make me a little iron spider, and all the
                              rest of the galls got all sorts of little housekeepin' things giv to
                              them; and then we jumped into the cutters, again, and raced off; I
                              leading as before, to the tavern where we had ordered the dinner and
                              old uncle Pete, the black fiddler.
                           Such a dinner! my sakes! most equal to Thanksgiving day! turkey and
                              cranberries; turnip sass and potatoes; chicken pie, and other
                              beverages; pickled tongue, pumpkin pudding, pound cake, pork and
                              beans, and ever so much more; and the older went fluctuatin round
                                 considerable.
                           After dinner uncle Pete struck up some lively dancing tunes, and let
                              into em' in such real earnest, that we all put to and
                                 danced—didn't we dance! Somehow Mr. Lee thought he had
                              a sort o' right to me; I don't s'pose but what he had; so he danced
                              with me pretty much all the time. I tried 'mazin hard to tire him out;
                              but he was a first rate dancer, and no mistake.
                           "Then we played 'Hunt the key,' and 'Blind man's buff,' nearly
                              laughing ourselves into conniptions, till it became dark, and the
                              great splendid moon rose; and then we bundled on our cloaks and jumped
                              into the cutters like mad, we leading again; and Mr. Lee
                              saying a power of pretty things to me, to all of which I answered,
                              'Nonsense! how you talk! du!
                           
                           "All of a sudden I kinder thought I felt an arm that didn't 'xactly
                              belong to me, round on my side of the cutter; the horse took to goin'
                              sideways; And before Mr. Lee knew what the critter was about, up, he
                              sidled against the fence; the cutter made a clean turn over, dumped us
                              out in the snow, and came down bang on top of us like a vegetable dish
                              cover.
                           "Well, I wasn't hurt a mite, but I lay perfectly still while Mr. Lee
                              floundered out; feeling flat enough, I know. He turned
                              the cutter over, and said in a low, trembling voice, 'Oh, Miss Briggs,
                              are you hurt?'
                           "'I'm so as I'm alive,' I answered as weak as water. You'd 'a been
                              surprised to see how quick he caught me up at that, and whipped me
                              back into the cutter before any of the others came in sight—no small
                              heft, I can tell you! Then he began begging my pardon; and wishing he
                              was to Jerusalem before he had got me hurt. I told him, in a feeble,
                              die-away voice, that I would forgive him on condition that he kept his
                              arm on his own side of the cutter for the rest of the ride; and then I
                              couldn't help laughing, which brightened him up so that I could
                              plainly see the joyful sparkle of his eyes in the moonlight. He begged
                              to call on me; but I told him I thought it wouldn't pay, as I was only
                              going to stay two weeks, and he'd have to ride nine miles. To tell the
                              truth I had been keepin' company for six months back with 'Lijah Peck
                              down to our place, and I rayther thought it wouldn't
                              do.
                           "But, dear sirs! who should come driving up next Sabbath evening but
                              Seth Lee, looking as nice as a fresh pot of butter. I was provoked
                              enough; for I knew uncle would begin teasin' me soon's ever he went,
                              to make up for the, bet he lost (pretty, green plaid gingham 'twas),
                              so I kinder held back and said, 'Oh, Mr. Lee, is that you?'
                           "'Yes,' says he, 'and I can't flatter myself you are very glad to see
                              me.' He had held out his hands to shake mine; but now he made believe
                              he was coming forward to warm them at the fire.
                           "'Well I never!' said I. 'S'pose you sit down;' and then I sat down
                              too as prim as a peapod, took out my knitting, and stuck to it
                                 stiddy;*
                               for I'd no idee of givin' uncle a chance to make any more fun
                              of me. I didn't care a snap for Mr. Lee, that's a fact! but he was no
                              end of polite, and kept
                              
                                 
                                 *In old times in New England, the Sabbath began at sundown on
                                    Saturday, and ended at the same time on Sunday, and everybody
                                    worked or frolicked on Sunday evening.
                              
                              looking, and talking to me, spite of my huffing him; and, would you
                              believe it? invited me to a concert with him the next Wednesday
                              evening.
                           "'Twarn't no use to say 'no;' so I said 'yes,' for there uncle sat, as
                              solemn as a deacon, waiting to plague me soon's ever he'd gone. I had
                              a pretty good spell of it, I rather guess; but I went to the concert,
                              and had a real nice time; and Mr. Lee came again before the two weeks
                              were over; and when I did go home, there he was at the half-way house,
                                 of course; and this time he was very particler indeed
                              helping me into the sleigh, while uncle was talking with his father,
                              and saying in a quick way, 'Miss Briggs, I'm going next week, with
                              fourteen other young men, to settle Rochester in York State. It will
                              be two years before I can come back; do you think you could like me
                              well enough to wait for me, and accept me for your pardner? I shall
                              then, God willing, have a good home, and the same honest, loving heart
                              I offer to you now.'
                           "Well, the dear me! I felt flurried enough, but I managed to say I
                              didn't think I liked him well enough to make any promises.
                           "'May I write to you, then?' said he, his voice trembling, and his
                              face pale and solemn.
                           "'Well,' said I, ''twon't be much use, but if you want to very much
                              I've no particler objection.'
                           "'Will you answer my letters?' said he.
                           "Just then uncle came alongside, and off we went; and when I got home
                              I didn't know whether I was glad or sorry.
                           "But, somehow, I didn't relish having 'Lijah Peck 'round after this,
                              'specially as he blew me up sky high for keeping company with another
                              fellow. He'd heard of my doin's, and warn't goin' to
                              stand it no how! He knew all about the grand sleighing
                              party; need't tell him!
                           "Upon that I got in a huff, and just gave him the mitten, and, my
                              grief! he went off short meter! mad as forty!
                           "Well, you see, the post office wasn't the thing it is now-a-days, and
                              the mail only went to Rochester once in four weeks, as it was a new
                              settlement; but at the end of that time I got a letter, and in four
                              weeks more another, and so on, till I had seven in my drawer."
                           "Of course you answered them, cousin Miranda. didn't you?" I
                              asked.
                           "Not one!" she answered, laughing. "You see, he wrote such all killin'
                              fine things, full of poetry
                              and that, it made me afraid to answer him, so I just let it alone. But
                              one day father came up to me, just as I'd got through baking, with
                              another letter, and such a wonderful solemn face, I knew I was going
                              to catch it. Says he—
                           "'Mirandy, are you triflin' with that ere young man's feelin's?'
                           "'For pity's sake, I don't know,' I said.
                           "'Do you answer his letters?'
                           "'Well, good land! I rayther guess I don't.'
                           "'You don't! Well, I'm beat! You just go up stairs and answer this
                              immediate! He's a very fine young man, and I'm not a goin' to have you
                              flirtin' round this way no longer.'
                           "I didn't dare to disobey; so I answered the letter the best I knew
                              how; and after that, Mr. Lee and I kept it, up pretty stiddy a year
                              longer; and then he came back, looking so handsome, and rich in money
                              and lands, and asked me once more to be his wife.
                           "I said 'No,' and felt bad enough when he reproached me; but 'twarn't
                              no use talking. I couldn't be his wife, for I didn't love him
                                 enough; and I just told him so, and begged him to forget me,
                              and let me help him to find a better wife than I would make. You see I
                              had a friend, a wonderful nice gal; her name was Phœbe Ann Pemberton;
                              and I thought I'd try and see if I couldn't make a match of it. So I
                              begged him to forgive me all the pain I'd caused him, and think no
                              more of me, but come next Sabbath evening to tea just the same. He had
                              to say yes; he 
                                 coudn't
                                 couldn't
                               help it; and I saw he was hoping to change my mind; but I
                              took mighty good care to have Phoebe Ann there, with her soft ways,
                              pink cheeks, hazel eyes, and hair the color of a ripe chesnut. Of
                              course I didn't let on a word to either; but they took to each other
                              wonderful, and—would you believe it? six weeks after that they were
                              married!"
                           Here cousin Miranda saddened all at once. A fluttering sigh escaped
                              her lips, and then for a moment the room was as still as death. I
                              wondered to myself if she had mistaken her feelings there and then,
                              and had heedlessly thrown away her happiness. Presently she roused
                              herself and went on.
                           "Well, five years after that, the man I was to marry came
                              along. He was nearly as poor as poor could be; and father and mother
                              didn't relish the match, or like him any too well; but I
                                 loved him, and he was very kind to me; and I don't
                                 think there was a
                              happier woman, little or big, in our town, till I lost him."
                           Here there was another saddening of the handsome face, and a long
                              pause.
                           "Did you ever see Mr. Lee again?" I asked.
                           "Why, Land o' Liberty! How strange things come about! Five years ago
                              last summer, just after I lost my husband, I was sitting by the window
                              one moonlight evening, feeling lonesome enough. The laylocks were in
                              full bloom, and their sweet breath came in to me upon the soft summer
                              wind; but strange enough, I was thinking of the winter time, and of
                              that very sleighing party more'n forty years ago, when some one walked
                              up the path and knocked at the door.
                           "I don't know why I felt nervous and flurried; but I certainly did
                              when I opened the door, and there stood a fine looking old gentleman
                              with white hair. Raising his hat with a bow as grand as if I was the
                              queen, he said, 'Be you Miss Briggs, that was?' 'I calkilate you are
                              right,' said I, 'Who be you?'
                           "'Only Seth Lee,' he said.
                           "'The Land alive! Mr. Lee!' I cried, 'how do you do?' and, old woman
                              as I was, my heart jumped right into my throat, and that was all I
                              said. But he knew he was welcome, I'll be bound; and he came in and
                              sat down, and we had such a grand long talk!
                           "I do say for't! It was most delightful, for he had the same pleasant
                              smile and ways that I remembered so well. He told me that he had left
                              Rochester and lived in Albany, was very wealthy, and had a fine family
                              of sons and daughters; and then he thanked me for helping him to such
                              an excellent wife, and told me she had been his right hand all these
                              long years. He called them 'short.' He, brought her dear
                              love to, me; for he had left home on purpose to find me, and begged me
                              to come and make them a real long visit. And then he wanted to know
                              all about me; and I told him how long I had been a widow, and how,
                              soon after my husband's death one of my darlings had gone home to meet
                              him and her Heavenly Father; and how the rest were married away; and I
                              passed most of my time with them because they loved me so dearly, and
                              the little farm was lonely. And after that he went away, and I sat
                              down and had a good hearty cry."
                           She paused, and I said softly, "Did you go to visit them?"
                           
                           "No," she answered, "I never did, for a few weeks after that,
                                 he went away."
                           "And where does he live now, cousin Miranda?"
                           "IN ETERNITY," she said.
                           No description can convey the solemnity with which she uttered those
                              two last words. Her story was ended.
                           The fire now flickered and gleamed, now burned with a sombre flame,
                              and in the deep stillness of the room, seemed whispering
                              those words over again. I looked through the window pane, and saw two
                              or three big stars gazing down upon us line spirits in the sky.
                           Little Allie's great gray eyes were brimming over with tears; the
                              child understood it all; and Adelaide had been listening with such
                              rapt attention, that at those last solemn words, a perceptible pallor
                              had spread like a vail over her sweet young, face. Then I seemed to
                              feel that this story had been told with the loving intention of
                              conveying a latent warning to my darling; and I prayed God in my heart
                              that she might ponder well upon this jewel of experience so delicately
                              and lovingly presented, none the less precious from its quaint
                              setting, and know herself, lest she should some time
                              recklessly throw away a good man's love.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               I had spoken my last words with a foolish, trembling voice; but, on looking round,
                  I saw that I need not have been ashamed of it for the women were in tears, and the
                  men little better.
               "H-e-m!" Mr. Growler cleared his throat with such tremendous energy, we all jumped
                  in our chairs. "I—I—confound it! What's the matter with my eyes? I see double!" he
                  cried, rubbing them spitefully, "I venerate, I love cousin Miranda! I shall marry
                  her! That is, if she'll have me! I don't care if she is a hundred years old! The
                  more the merrier with such a woman!"
               Prophetic Mr. Growler! What if he should marry my cousin Miranda? I rather liked
                  the idea. To be sure, he always did his utmost to look and act as if he had been
                  soaking in a barrel of vinegar, about half of every day; but there was not an
                  endless store of love and charity under that sour exterior; oh dear no! We hadn't
                  found him out a darling; certainly not! We didn't call him in private a heavenly
                  old humbug; never!
               "Aunt Miranda!" cried young Appreciate,
                  "how charming that sounds! what a dignified majestic name! and her hints, dear
                  Miss Adelaide, how admirable! Do you not think a young lady should be very
                  careful—should deliberate a long time, before she refuses a, faithful heart?"
                  Appreciate made this inquiry with a lackadaisical look and his heart
                  in his mouth. It very nearly choked him; and that, with the glance he gave her,
                  made his question appear very personal and particular.
               Instead of turning upon him a heavenly smile, by way of answer, cousin Adelaide
                  got frightened and was provoked that he should "say things" before so many people.
                  She was sure they were all laughing in their sleeves. How dared he make her blush
                  so? She knew perfectly well that he loved, adored, almost worshipped her; but he
                  was not to get her laughed at, for all that. So the sweet angel turned tyrant, and
                  raising her long lovely lashes fired a deadly shot of anger at him, and gave a
                  little satirical giggle which withered him. He never imagined that she was just
                  one hair's breadth from crying. In a moment more she had made an excuse, to leave
                  the room; and when she returned, I could see that tears had been wiped away, for
                  her violet eyes had a dreamy, sad expression.
               While we were drinking our chocolate, and poor young Appreciate, miserable, for
                  the first time since our evenings began, was listlessly playing with his spoon and
                  cup, I heard her gently whisper, "I am sorry I was so cross." At the sound of the
                  sweet murmur, every nerve in him thrilled, and the color darted into his face as
                  he answered, "I wish I could believe you really in earnest." He sighed deeply; and
                  the shy girl, frightened again, drew back with a sudden reserve, and his wistful
                  look in her face brought small comfort to him.
               Adelaide walked beside me, going home that evening, Faint-hearted
                  Appreciate! Fearfully in love, and by consequence at them mercy of a demure little
                  girl of fifteen. Never heard of such a thing before! A handsome, intelligent
                  fellow turned into a miserable noodle. Certainly Adelaide deserved a good shaking;
                  so I shook her when I got her home, without explaining why; and kissed her and
                  packed her off to bed.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE long promised "Marble Bust" made its appearance on the occasion of our next
                  meeting. Harry had altered and altered, he said, till he was thoroughly
                  discouraged: he declared it was hardly worth the reading.
               "We have both been so worried, too," put in the little wife. "Our darling Carrie
                  has had a very bad cough, quite bad enough to alarm us. She is better to-day, dear
                  little soul! but I feel so anxious I have told my maid of all work to sit with her
                  the whole evening. So Harry to-night is door-opener, and I am waiter to the
                  company;" and she bobbed a little courtesy to us, and said in a mincing voice, "If
                  you please, ladies and gents, I knows how to wait in the genteelerest manner;
                  quite out of the common," and she dropped another little courtesy.
               "You're right there," cried Mr. Wilton, laughing. "I never had a
                  servant who courtesies to me when she waited upon me; and my wife
                  says when she engages new 'help,' and goes into the room to question them, they
                  never dream of rising on her entrance and standing respectfully, as they should.
                  Not they! What's the use of coming to a free and equal country if they can't
                  behave like pigs, and wear crinoline and silk dresses with flounces, while
                  washing, the dishes? Why! one of them told my wife there was no 'quality' here,
                  and she would not make muffins every morning for breakfast! So she 'discharged'
                  us."
               We laughed at this "o'er true" description of one of the abuses of our glorious
                  republic; then we turned sad to think there were some who had been public servants
                  and called themselves patriots, who for their own, ambitious and depraved private
                  ends were straining every nerve to bring this, the best government the world ever
                  saw, to ruin, even now.
               But I dreaded to have anything said, well knowing that Mr. Growler grew frantic if
                  the war was mentioned; if he could have had the power, the price of hemp would
                  have risen amazingly, so great would
                  have been his demand and immediate use of that article for the benefit of
                  Seceshdom.
               So I said—"Come, Harry, let's have your 'Marble Bust.' I am all curiosity—none of
                  us will listen with marble hearts. If we yawn, you can stop. Voila!"
               "At the first yawn the 'Marble Bust' goes into the fire; so have a care,
                  Wilton!"
               "He!" cried his wife, "let him try! If I see his mouth beginning to open I'll play
                  chinchopper, like the children, and he's so afraid of me he won't dare to stir if
                  he is six feet high, and as strong as a lion—would you, dear?"
               At this lamb-like ending of such a terrible threat, we all laughed heartily; and
                  Harry, thanking his little ally, and begging her for his sake, to keep a sharp eye
                  upon all of us, began as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           THE MARBLE BUST.
                           
                              
                                 
                                    "My eyelids steeped in languor meet.
                                    I dream: A stately knight and tall,
                                    O'erleaps the rude and frowning wall,
                                    And bends him lowly at my feet."
                                 
                              
                           
                           Within an easy distance of New York, up on the Hudson River, there is
                              an, elegant country mansion sion situated on the apex of a beautiful
                              grassy knoll; the grass so thick and soft that but for the open-eyed
                              daisies, that will spring up here and there, you would
                              seem to be treading on emerald green velvet.
                           A semicircular grove of evergreens, firs, and larches, form an
                              admirable background and relief to the house, which is painted of a
                              creamy tint, with brown copings and cornices. Crowning the handsome
                              gateposts, at the entrance to the park-like lawn are two classical
                              vases from which in summer, the golden honeysuckle, eglantine, and
                              other lovely flowering plants throw profuse tendrils caressingly
                              downward in loving tribute to the natural taste of the young girl who
                              placed them there.
                           The winding drive brings you first to beautiful little rustic bridge,
                              light, delicate, but strong. It is brown across a ravine, full of
                              fairies on moonlight nights for romantic young ladies, and will-o'-the
                              wisps, and goblins for sinners. Crossing this a moment after you are
                              riding through a dim Gothic aisle so long, that the perspective
                              lessening is quite perceptible. It is formed by training the branches
                              of the arbor-vitæ so that they are
                              joined overhead; and you would be surprised to observe how,
                                 admirably mirably this
                              gives the impression of the "regulation dim religious light" of an
                              arched and Gothic aisle. Indeed, visitors coming suddenly out of the
                              gloom, are astonished at the remarkable brightness of the sun, and
                              find themselves curiously winking and blinking, and quite unable to
                              return the inquiring stares of the respectable brown stone lions,
                              which a very short turn of the road discloses to them as grimly
                              defending and adorning the front door.
                           The interior of the house is admirably planned, and the rooms are
                              magnificently furnished; but for a list of particulars I beg to refer
                              you to Messrs. Marcotte and Meeks, who fortunately obtained the
                              contract. I could not begin to do justice to the carved
                              marvels in satinwood, rosewood, and oakwood of these artists; neither
                              shall I make more than "mere mention" of the fine specimens of
                              sculpture ornamenting the halls, or the beautiful paintings
                              ornamenting the walls, except to say of the latter, that the owner had
                              had them executed to his own order when abroad, giving special
                              directions that such copies as "interiors," &c., should be,
                                 painted twice the size of the originals—or no pay! This was
                              really a miraculous conception, and invariably stultified those
                                 who knew.
                           There is a billiard room with excellent appointments, a fencing room
                              plentifully provided with foils, masks, buttons, &c., and
                              abundance of spare rooms for the many visitors (friends, shall I say)
                              who come up from New York to make an afternoon call; and as a
                              never-varying, but slightly comical matter of course, immediately
                              accept the faintest invitation to stay all night— "dear me, had a
                              nightcap in my pocket quite by accident."
                           And now the family. It consisted of Mr. Douglas, his daughter, and
                              Mrs. Stubbs, his widowed sister.
                           Mr. Douglas, though exceedingly proud of his name and family, was also
                              remarkably fond of money. He had married in early life a young lady
                              who, dying, left him ten thousand a year and a daughter to bring up.
                              About the same time his sister had scandalized the family name, by
                              marrying Stubbs the grocer; but then Stubbs was very rich, and
                              Shakespeare says, "What's in a name, as long as you have money?"
                              Stubbs,(good soul for that) left her a widow in two
                              years; and she, rich and childless put all her affairs into her
                              brother's hands, saying, "If you will look after my property, I will
                              bring up your daughter. If you will be my man of business, I will be your
                              daughter's governess."
                           So Mr. Douglas worked like any farmer, and added yearly to his already
                              large fortune. He established a large brick factory on his estate;
                              cultivated strawberries and cabbages for sale; collected his sister's
                              rents and interests with savage punctuality, and took precisely as
                              deep an interest in her affairs as in his own, because—Helen was her
                              only heir.
                           Mrs. Stubbs was an oddity—an institution. She would have been a
                              curiosity in a museum. Almost as tall as her brother, if she had only
                              had a little more mustache she could have enlisted under General
                              Fremont as body guardsman. Her hands and feet were tremendous; her
                              frame, built as solidly as a house, was surmounted by a head which, if
                              not handsome, was at least large. Her nose was aquiline and
                              threatening; here mouth severe, disclosing a dangerous block of teeth
                              white as snow and not bought of the dentist. Her arms and
                              shoulders were massively beautiful, and she knew it, and took good
                              care to show them. You might see her at almost any hour in a
                              low-necked dress, caring not a straw for custom or fashion; She cut
                              her own dresses, and the results were amazing as well as novel. When
                              her bonnets were sent to her from the milliners, out came her scissors
                              and in three snips she would convert the poor woman's masterpieces
                              into dismal wrecks.
                           Her costume was a mixture of all styles, models, and materials.
                              Eruptions of buttons in unexpected places; twenty different colored
                              bows of ribbons worn all at once; and breastpins stuck all over, so
                              that her stomacher looked like a well-furnished pin-cushion. She would
                              have given a Madame Didon the nightmare, and rejoiced over it
                              afterward.
                           Her mind was of a similar pattern to her dress, but that was the fault
                              of her family, who maintained that a man could never know too much or
                              a woman too little. I know a man at this moment of rare 
                                 inellectual
                                 intellectual
                               attainments who looks exceedingly, amazed when his wife
                              gives utterance to a beautiful, tender, far-reaching thought; and is
                              absolutely disgusted when she shows pleased and intelligent
                              comprehension of a logical theory or abstruse idea. He
                              too maintains that women are made to love, and their
                              capping Latin verses, and construing problems in logarithms, plays the
                              deuce with the original wise intention.
                           Lords of Creation! don't be so afraid.
                           
                           Thus it came to pass that Mrs. Stubbs, née Douglas, defied all the rules of orthography;
                              miscalled words by the dozen, though she talked so fast that her
                              ridiculous blunders frequently escaped notice; ran from one subject to
                              another; told twenty stories at once without connection, order, or
                              transition, and half the time did not know what she said, what she
                              did, or what she meant. It may seem strange that Mr. Douglas should
                              have intrusted the education of his daughter to such an unreasonable
                              woman; but, as I have told you, he was very busy making
                                 money; and is not that sufficient pressure on the
                              brain? The country might be going to destruction, and the world coming
                              to an end, and he would work his one idea all the harder. Then don't
                              you be unreasonable, and expect him to bother himself about one little
                              girl. He knew if she did not learn much that ought to be known,
                              neither would she learn much that ought not to be; besides, he had a
                              theory that the best tutor for a girl was her husband.
                           And so this young creature grew up under her aunt's eye, who took care
                              that no master under sixty should come near her charge; even the
                              dancing master not being excepted, who gallantly picked up her pocket
                              handkerchief with unspeakable torture from the lumbago in his back.
                              The only books permitted were Walter Scott's, Madame Cottin, and a few
                              highflown romances of chivalry, which had been the delight of Mrs.
                              Stubbs' own girlhood.
                           Helen, at this time, was not over sixteen, but tall and well
                              developed. You might have thought her cheeks were a little too rosy,
                              and her hands somewhat too red; but an excess of color is not
                              unobjectionable in very young girls. Her mouth and teeth were
                              charming; her figure lithe and graceful; and her feet and hands, if
                              not of the smallest, were beautifully formed.
                           Her mind—ah! her mind was as yet a mystery. She was no talker, partly
                              perhaps, because nobody said anything to her. Her rather had no time,
                              and her aunt, took the lion's share in the conversation. The gentlemen
                              who visited at the house did not think it worth their while, or it
                              might just be possible, did not know how, to draw out a silent child,
                              who never having been to boarding school, where girls learn, oh! how
                              much more and worse than parents imagine, did not encourage them to
                              try by her knowing manner.
                           And so she passed for nearly a fool; and when she went to walk in the
                              park or woods adjoining,
                              book in hand, and escorted invariably by her maid or old Peter, Mrs.
                              Stubbs would say to herself, as she followed her with her eyes, "Poor
                              little thing! she says nothing; but may an alligator eat me if she
                              thinks either." The aunt was far from supposing that the lonely little
                              girl's head was full of the old romances she read, and that she put
                              herself in the place of every heroine, and had already had in
                              imagination more adventures than the fair Angelica, or the Lady
                              Dulcibella of the tale.
                           
                           One day, early in June, Mr. Douglas went away on a journey; and Mrs.
                              Stubbs had darted off like a flash to New York; a sudden crotchet
                              having got into her head that she would have what she called her
                                 "busk" taken.
                           "I go to New York to order my busk," she cried, kissing her niece,
                              "and you must keep house. If the servants misbehave, tweak their noses
                              for me, my dear. I shall be back in the afternoon train."
                           So Helen had the long summer day to herself and her dreams. In the
                              afternoon she wandered out, followed at a respectful distance by old
                              Peter. At an unfrequented corner of the park, near a ha-ha wall was a
                              grand old oak, with a rustic seat underneath neath; a small gate kept
                              locked, because little used, was near. Helen sat down under the oak
                              and took a book out of her pocket. It was called "The very true
                              history of the wonderful adventures of the incomparable Belinda."
                           She looked for her mark and read aloud:
                           "Know, then, that the wise and beautiful princess was sought in
                              marriage by the eldest son of the King of the Great Gawks and by the
                              Caliph of Shirat."
                           "Poor thing," said Helen; "I would have taken neither. But what said
                              the princess?" She read on.
                           "And much did the fair Belinda lament; and found no consolation
                              anywhere, because the prince had a crooked face, a nose both short and
                              flat, and ears the size of frying pans."
                           "Good gracious!" exclaimed Helen, "he must have looked like Mr. Smith,
                              the gentleman my father wants me to marry. Now let's see how the other
                              turned out."
                           "And the Prince of the Great Gawks was lean and lanky in his person,
                              and chalky in the face, as if his veins ran milk and water instead of
                              blood."
                           "Mercy on me! that's not a little like Mr. Livingston, my aunt's man. Now let's
                              see what happened."
                           "The poor princess wept incessantly, and heartily wished for a
                              friendly dragon, who with a fiery tongue, pestiferous breath, and
                              monstrous claws, might slay them both. At last the tournament was
                              held, and these lovers were to run a course against each other; and
                              the hand of the princess was the prize.
                           "The beautiful Belinda and her ladies were seated on a scaffolding,
                              spread with crimson velvet, overlooking the lists; they were
                              splendidly attired in cloth of gold, and bedecked with pearls and
                              jewelry.
                           "But before the rival champions came to blows, there entered the lists
                              a knight richly adorned and armed in white, who uplifted his
                              emblazoned silver shield, and cried out, 'Put no lance in rest against
                              each other! I will defeat you both! I will make both bite the dust!'
                              His voice was so terrible, that the like never before was heard; and
                              both knights and horses were fain to tremble with fear. But the
                              beautiful princess trembled with joy.
                           "Without another word, the White Knight poised his lance and charged
                              the caliph.
                           "At the first dash, down he went with a piercing shriek! and
                              immediately thereafter became insensible.
                           "Then round wheeled the conqueror on the prince. His onset was so
                              tremendous that his lance was shivered. Quick as the lightning he
                              turned, caught the prince round the body, dragged him from his horse
                              and threw him with such force on the ground that he was nearly severed
                              in twain.
                           "And the princess and her ladies applauded, and waved their
                              'kerchiefs, and thought the White Knight handsomer than an angel.
                           "Then came he before the ladies all, and bending knee to earth at the
                              feet of the fair Belinda, said, 'Lady, I am the Prince of Silver; and
                              as silver melts in flame, so melts my heart in the flame kindled by
                              your unutterable charms.'
                           Belinda—I mean Helen, now went on reading with her eyes tight
                              shut.
                           The day was sultry; the leaves of the old oak seemed sleeping; the
                              warm summer sun, poured a flood of splendor over everything. The air
                              was filled with the delicious perfume of cut grass; and the shining
                              river reflected the sapphire blue of he sky above.
                           Helen was in that delectable state between sleeping and waking, when meditation
                              and dreams, truth and reality, seem to join hands.
                           She imagined wry-faced Mr. Smith buckled up in a cuirass, the tail of
                              his long coat sticking out beneath, with a saucepan on his head, the
                              handles of which were represented by his ears.
                           On the other hand Mr. Livingston, long and lanky, making direful faces
                              through the visor of a plumed helmet. She saw too the gallant Prince
                              of Silver, but could not make out his features, as they too were
                              hidden beneath his casque.
                           "Shall I never see his face," she sighed; "it is high time if he means
                              to deliver me from the Caliph Shirat Smith and the Prince Great Gawk
                              Livingston—I've waited quite long enough."
                           And in her meditative doze, she repeated the words of a child's song: 
                                 
                                    One night I heard the dogs bark,
                                    I went to the window to see,
                                    And there came a young man hunting,
                                    But he was not hunting for me."
                                 
                              
                           
                           Suddenly a meteor seem to rush by her. A tall young man with a black
                              beard had sprang at one leap over the wall, and dropped on his knee on
                              the grass before her. She started up, while old Peter hastened toward
                              her as fast as his spindle legs would let him.
                           Scarcely awake, Helen's first thought was that the Prince of Silver
                              had arrived at last. She stuttered out some incoherent words,
                              "Prince—my father—your rivals—Oh!" The young man got up hastily, bowed
                              very politely, and said "Excuse me, young lady, for coming in so like
                              a bombshell, and falling accidentally at your feet. I have been
                              shaking that little gate for the last quarter of an hour, and not
                              succeeding in opening it, I took the shortest way to get in. My name
                              is David Dow, and I have come from New York to take Mrs. Stubbs'
                              bust."
                           David Dow always reminds me of the heroes in Dumas' novel of "The
                              Three Guardsmen." Imagine the figure of D'Artagnan, the pride of
                              Athos, the vivacity of Aramis, and a little of the simplicity, the
                                 naïveté of Pathos, and you will
                              have an exact idea of our young sculptor.
                           His figure was tall and as supple as a steel spring; and though of
                              almost slender symmetry muscular and powerful. His broad and polished
                              forehead was set off and adorned by a profusion of curling black hair; his mustache turned
                              up at the ends in an adorable twist; and his large, liquid, blue eyes
                              sparkled and melted beneath the most beautiful, jet-black brows.
                              Altogether he was what the young ladies call, "a love."
                           Add to these, pearly teeth, which seemed delighted to live in a
                              charming, laughing mouth; a long and slender nose like that in the
                              portraits of Francis I.; child-like hands; a woman's foot; and I think
                              your senses—if you are a young lady, reading this veracious
                              history—will begin to totter, and you will be ready to exclaim like
                              Desdemona, "Oh that Heaven had made me such a ——" stop! wait! That
                              quotation won't do—Desdemona—odd creature! was hifaluting about a
                              gentleman of color. There's no telling what may happen
                              when the war is over, slavery a myth, and the second sentence in our
                              glorious Declaration of Independence comes to be the truth, the whole
                              truth, and nothing but the truth; but until that happy time at least,
                              and ever after, I earnestly trust young ladies will dream of lovers of
                              David Dow's shade of complexion; and I hope with all my heart their
                              dreams will come to be as true as is my story.
                           This handsome young fellow was the son of an honest but poor vegetable
                              gardener on Staten Island. At four years old lie pulled weeds: at
                              twelve he helped to make the beds—garden beds: at fifteen he rode
                              about in a country wagon and sold cabbages and turnips. Then feeling
                              ambitious, he came to New York and worked for a marble cutter, who
                              first gave him stones to polish, then epitaphs to engrave, and finally
                              monuments to sculpture.
                           He showed surprising taste and skill; and one of those
                              few-and-far-between-angels, this time in the guise or disguise of a
                              rich man with a large heart, sent him to Rome and Paris with a
                              sufficient yearly allowance, there to learn his art.
                           He took his kind old mother with him, his father being, dead. He
                              studied and worked like a beaver; he carried off the first prize of
                              the academy; and he returned home to the country which his mother was
                              pining to lay her old bones in, to become illustrious by-and-by, no
                              doubt, but now to struggle as a rising man must, for the means to
                              live.
                           His mother kept house for him in three small rooms, of a house in
                              Tenth street near Tompkins Square. He earned a little money by placing
                                 some of his works in the
                              School of Design founded by that good and noble man Peter Cooper, who
                              will be most assuredly one of the seraphim
                                 illuminati in the heavenly world above. May God bless him
                              now and forever!
                           David also designed and sketched subjects for clocks. His busts and
                              medallions were beautifully executed. His groups, which he could not
                              afford to embody in a large form, and consequently had to sell to the
                              dealers in bronzes, were of the boldest and most classical designs. He
                              worked with passion, not for money or glory, but for the love of his
                              art. The love of an artist for his work can only be compared to that
                              of a mother for her child. Even a father cannot love so much—does not
                              love a child with all the ardor of his soul.
                           Thus David succeeded, not without many painful struggles, in gaining a
                              livelihood; like many noble natures, he had a thousand times more
                              talent than money.
                           Generous and thoughtless, he almost gave away his works. The dealers
                              eagerly bought of him, and took precious good care not to let him
                              suspect his rapid progress and growing reputation. The country-bred
                              prudence of his mother was useless here. The good old soul scarcely
                              knew the difference between a statue and a tombstone.
                           He worked by fits and starts like all artists: pressing debts did not
                              prevent him from taking a holiday when in the mood. This was a wise
                              instinct. A mill can grind all day and every day;. but a brain thus
                              worked would turn out but poor flour.
                           When David did work he would not quit it if the statue of Memnon were
                              singing in his ear; and when he was in the vein for amusement no power
                              on earth could have dragged him to his studio, not even that of
                              hunger, which tames the wolf.
                           He had only one regular habit, that of bodily exercise. He made his
                              fencing master come and awake him early in the morning, and it was at
                              the gymnasium that he digested his breakfast. In this way lie became
                              incredibly strong and dangerous in proportion.
                           He is the last man who keeps up the custom of throwing people out of
                              the window. I remember, one day, he threw a plumber who had insulted
                              his mother out of a second story window. There were no more rude
                              tradesmen in the house after that! With his mother and friends he was
                              the very impersonation of
                              tenderness. He embraced his mother with a gentle fondness, as if he
                              feared he might crush her. She would never keep a servant; and he
                              could only, when his purse was replenished, thrust upon her hats,
                              dresses, bottles of cordials, parasols, anything and everything that
                              came into his head, in spite of her earnest entreaties to him to save
                              the money.
                           When Mrs. Stubbs came to find him he was just beginning a new working
                              season. It was high time. Since the first of May he had been idle—off
                              on a pedestrian tour—and had completely forgotten that on the
                              fifteenth of July he had to pay two hundred dollars to his assistant,
                              and forty dollars on the first of August to his landlord.
                           David, who seldom had a call, was surprised to see this wild-looking
                              woman come in. She marched straight up to him and put out a great
                              hand, which he hesitated to take.
                           "Take that!" she ejaculated. "You don't know me, but I know you. I
                              bought your wreckship of Don Juan. You are a great
                              artist."
                           "My shipwreck of Don Juan!" exclaimed David, still astonished.
                           "Yes, your wreckship of Don Juan! It is in one of my parlors, on the
                              clock. But that's not all, I want my Busk for my niece, who is going,
                              to marry Mr. Livingston or Mr. Smith, I don't know which. How much
                              will you take me for? Quick! how much?"
                           "Twelve or fifteen sittings, madam."
                           "That's not money, you goose! twelve or fifteen sittings! I can't
                              afford the time. Where shall I have the sittings? Besides, you live
                              too far off; what on earth made you come to this barbarous place!
                              There are twenty dirty-faced, duck-legged children playing in front of
                              the door. You must come to my house, and this very afternoon, or no
                              busk! I will give you four hundred dollars. Is that enough? that will
                              be about thirty-five dollars a day. What do you think of me? I want to
                              be done in marble. Likenesses in bronze are too severe, like the old
                              Romans. You will take a suitable piece of marble and send it to my
                              house. I give you fair warning, if you don't flatter me tremendously,
                              and yet manage that everyone shall be struck dumb outright with the
                              likeness, I shall give you the busk for your pay. I won't have Helen
                              turn me into a scarecrow to frighten away the birds!"
                           
                           "Madam, I trust I shall make for you, not only a striking likeness but
                              a beautiful bust."
                           "Don't talk like a fool! If it looks like me it will be hideous!! I
                              look like the hum-ha, with my mustaches. You are the
                              beauty. Turn round, let me see your profile. Really, my dear, you are
                              stupidly magnificent! splendid! I always thought a sculptor and a
                              mason looked just alike. You must go this afternoon to my house. My
                              niece is very good looking, too. You shall see for yourself. Bring all
                              your tools. My niece does not look like me, very luckily. I am curious
                              to know what you will think of her intended, the one I have picked
                              out. Mr. Smith is frightful, but very rich, and that is why my brother
                              stands up for him. Mr. Livingston is far better looking,
                              and then his name! what a fine name! What an odd name you have! David
                              Dow! Awful! Here's my address, only a short walk from the railroad;
                              there is only one park in that region, and that is ours. Mind, you
                              come. We shall have company to dinner—Mr. Livingston among the rest.
                              But look out! don't you go to making love to my niece, no such fiddle
                              faddle nonsense! In your profession, you don't think of marrying. It's
                              all right! Come this afternoon"—and out she sailed.
                           No cataract in the world, from the falls of Tivoli to Niagara, could
                              compare with the torrent of Mrs. Stubbs' talk. David acted like a
                              traveller caught in a shower. He wrapped himself in silence, as in a
                              garment. The shower over and madam gone, he collected his scattered
                              senses and found that he had a fortunate chance to make a clear three
                              hundred dollars in a fortnight; the other hundred would pay for the
                              marble and workman.
                           He was rather pleased with his contemplated sitter's face, and had no
                              objection to a country life, while at the same time he was paying his
                              debts. While he was dressing he told his mother of his good
                              fortune.
                           "Thank Heaven, my son," she said, "those debts have kept me awake o'
                              nights. I will send you the tools, clay, &c., to-morrow. Let me
                              look over your clothes, and see if the buttons are all right. You must
                              make a respectable appearance. Then you must have money to give to the
                              servants, you know; so take all the money we have, except five
                              dollars. Work hard; don't fall in love with the young lady, and come back to your old
                              mother as quick as you can."
                           "Never fear for me, mother," cried David, "I shall have no more
                              feeling than a fish, apart from my art. I will only take ten dollars
                              with me; that will leave you ten; it is all we have, and with this
                              thought constantly before my mind, I shall feel that for such a poor
                              fellow as I, a young lady and an heiress is not a woman."
                           With this prosaic sentiment he bade his mother good-by; and thus the
                              puissant Prince of Silver set out for the kingdom of the incomparable
                              Belinda.
                           Helen never believed for an instant that such a handsome young man, of
                              such proud and gallant bearing, could be merely a sculptor. In a
                              moment she had built up a wonderful little romance, quite as probable
                              as that she had been reading.
                           "He must be of high birth," said she to herself. "His beautiful hands
                              and small feet prove it. And then he is very rich, or ought to be,
                              provided some jealous enchanter or dishonest guardian has not stripped
                              him of his inheritance. At all events they have probably left him some
                              old house on the banks of the Hudson, or on the top of the Catskill
                              Mountains. I would rather have it on the mountain tain like an eagle's
                              nest. It is more in accordance with the romance of the thing. Let me
                              see—where can he have met me? At the ball last winter; or perhaps at
                              Saratoga last summer, where I stayed only three days? Yes! I have seen
                              him! Yes! I remember him! It was at the ball! My aunt had a headache
                              and took me away at twelve o'clock, just like Cinderella. Poor prince!
                              what despair he must have been in, when he found I was gone! Since
                              that fatal moment, he has been seeking me everywhere. At last fortune
                              favored him. Yesterday he was in the studio of a sculptor—a friend—who
                              was absent at the moment. My aunt came in; he recognized her; he
                              seized the lucky opportunity, and the rest is plain enough. But will
                              he be able to carry out his scheme? How will he escape the sharp eyes
                              of his rivals? They will soon perceive that my aunt's bust stands
                              still. To be sure I can help him to conceal his real intentions, as I
                              am in the secret; but oh! suppose be should be imprudent!"
                           Our moon-struck young lady could not consent to figure in a romance
                              with a hero of less rank than a prince. This one then must have come
                              over express from Europe although in some cabalistic way known only to herself she had
                              managed to give him an estate in her own country.
                           David, in sublime ignorance of all this, walked with Helen to the
                              house, talking of indifferent matters, and admiring the beauty of the
                              place. He was by no means blind to the beauty also of his companion,
                              and thought he should like to take her bust for nothing; when he
                              remembered his mother's advice, and scolded himself for the
                              thought.
                           At the entrance to the mansion they met Mrs. Stubbs, who had just
                              arrived.
                           "How the deuce did you get in?" she cried.
                           David told her.
                           "What! Why the camels of the Tyrol are not better
                              jumpers! My brother will instal you in your new quarters. Peter, show
                              this gentleman to the green room. Both the lovers of my niece will
                              sleep here. You shall be in the room between them, and keep them from
                              fighting."
                           David bowed low to hide a grin, and followed Peter.
                           "Well, Helen," said her aunt, "what do you think of my sculptor? He is
                              to make my busk, as a surprise for myself. We begin
                              to-morrow. He has not much of an artist look about him, has he? He is
                              abominably handsome! His wife will be a proud and happy woman! He is a
                              hundred times beautifuller than any of the gentleman who come here!
                              But mind! you must not look at him. If you discover he is
                              handsome, he shall march, double quick!"
                           "Can my aunt be in the plot?" thought Helen.
                           David took possession of a very pretty room, furnished with elegant
                              simplicity. A small bookcase held about fifty popular novels, and a
                              few of those more serious works which we read when we want to go to
                              sleep. The window opened upon a charming prospect; the lawn, the
                              garden, and the blue dimpling Hudson. The young artist was charmed,
                              and gazed with a soft, happy expression upon all this loveliness. An
                              emotion of gratitude to the Great Maker swelled his heart; and he
                              already regretted that he would so soon have to go back to the dusty
                              city. True, he might have made many delays; but there was the pressing
                              necessity for the money; and no happiness could make head against the
                              want of four hundred dollars. Absorbed in such reflections, he sat
                              gazing out of the window, till at last his eyes closed, and he slept
                              the sleep of the strong and innocent, till the dinner bell rang.
                           
                           David found a party of ten or fifteen people sitting on the lawn on
                              rustic seats. Mrs. Stubbs had not yet come down. He looked for a
                              familiar face; but found no one but Helen, to whose side he
                              immediately hastened in so marked a manner that every one noticed it;
                              and Helen was so troubled by this, that she could hardly refrain from
                              saying, "Take care! they are watching us!"
                           The second time the bell rang, Mrs. Stubbs made her appearance in
                              eleven flounces, took his arm, marched him into the house, seated him
                              at her right hand, and did not say four words to him all dinner
                              time.
                           His neighbor on the other side was a deaf old lady, and so he had an
                              opportunity to enjoy his meal in quiet. The rest talked of New York
                              and the war, and ran down their intimate friends. David eat and
                              listened. His only attempt was to discover which was Mr. Smith, and
                              which was Mr. Livingston; this did not cost him much trouble. Mr.
                              Smith was very rich, so I may venture to add that he was
                              also red faced, big nosed, small eyed, high shouldered, short armed,
                              and thick legged. If he had not shaved every day, his beard would have
                              grown over his eyes. But it is right to say that he was very careful
                              of his person. He observed the severest regimen; eat only white meat;
                              never touched pastry or puddings, and wore corsets. He took regular
                              exercise, subscribed to a gymnasium, learnt boxing, fencing,
                              singlestick, broadsword exercise, and rode on horseback; and he did
                              all this to keep back a tendency to grow fat, which threatened him.
                              These exercises, commenced from necessity, became his pleasure and
                              boast from habit. He piqued himself on his physical strength. He was
                              certainly a man of honor, and had as much talent as most fencing
                              masters.
                           Mr. Livingston despised the strength of his rival, on the principle
                              inferred in the 
                                 anecedote
                                 anecdote
                               of the fox and grapes. He was certainly born under the milky
                              way, for he was so white, limp, and thin, that disease would not have
                              known how to lay hold of him, and years left little or no mark. Though
                              full forty, people said of him, "Poor young man!" This feeble creature
                              was a captain in the navy. He entered the naval school at fourteen,
                              and pursued his studies in port. The only voyage he ever made was one
                              round the world, an interesting cruise to him as he was sea-sick the
                              whole time; yet political favor had put him where he was; and the
                                 prestige of his name had
                              completed Mrs. Stubbs' fascination. He had little or no fortune; but
                              he had been well educated; and like all officers had polished manners;
                              for let me whisper that the "shiver my timbers" style the stage is so
                              fond of producing, is not to be found in real life. It disappeared
                              long ago. If etiquette and polite language is ever banished from the
                              parlors, it will be found again on board of our vessels of war.
                           The two gentlemen watched the face of the new comer; and for once
                              ceased watching each other. Each felt sure of overthrowing his rival,
                              the one relying on his money, the other on his name; The plebeian
                              depended on the father, the gentleman on the aunt. The arrival of such
                              a handsome young man gave them a start; he seemed a very likely person
                              to play third lover. His tremendous appetite was some comfort; a man
                              who eat like a farmer could not be in love. Yet they noticed that
                              Helen, who sat opposite, frequently raised her eyes to glance at the
                              stranger.
                           On rising from the table the two suitors drew near Mrs. Stubbs. She
                              presented David to them, saying, "Here is my new boarder, Mr. Dow, the
                                 author of my clock. He is about to make
                              my head. By the way sir, have you, ordered your marble to
                              be brought here?"
                           David could not help smiling, as be replied, "Oh, madam, there is
                              plenty of time for the marble."
                           "What?! Plenty of time? But my head is pressing! I want it begun
                              immediately."
                           The artist informed her that it was necessary first to model her bust
                              in clay; then, to make a casting in plaster; and then to touch it up
                              with the utmost care before coming to the marble.
                           "Gracious goodness! Who'd have thought it? How long!" exclaimed the
                              good lady.
                           "He wants to gain time," thought Helen, who had not lost a single
                              word.
                           Thereupon coffee was brought in. There were several young ladies from
                              the neighborhood who came in during the evening. Mrs. Stubbs sat down
                              at the piano and played for them to waltz. David danced with Helen and
                              acquitted himself admirably.
                           "Ah!" sighed she, "I was sure of it! No sculptor could dance so! but
                              he will betray himself."
                           The waltz ended, David took Mrs. Stubbs' place, and played a
                              quadrille, and did it tolerably well. Mrs. Stubbs danced opposite her
                              niece. In the "ladies'
                              chain" she pressed her hand and whispered, "Do you hear that? For a
                              man who cuts marble—"
                           "My aunt is certainly in the secret," thought Helen.
                           After this there was a game of whist; the two suitors, a rich banker
                              from New York, and David.
                           "The ordinary stake, I suppose," said the banker "a dollar a
                              corner."
                           "Very high for a poor officer," said Mr. Livingston.
                           But David had already answered, "Yes, the ordinary bet."
                           Helen blushed to her cars. What would they think when the
                              Prince of Silver should pull out a pocket book with his crest stamped
                              on it, and stuffed full of gold! She glided up to him, and said, "Mr.
                              Dow, I shall only allow you one rubber, after which I want you."
                           She had not long to wait, for David lost again and again, and left his
                              five dollars on the table. He laid them down with so much apparent
                              indifference that Messrs. Smith and Livingston exchanged a look, which
                              seemed to say, "These artists must make a great deal of money!"
                           Mrs. Stubbs noticed nothing. She was playing "Muggins" with a party at
                              the next table. So David walked away in a very thoughtful mood. He was
                              reflecting that he had no money to pay for the carriage of his tools
                              and clay. Helen approached him and said, "Mr. Dow, I am quite ashamed
                              of my ignorance. We have sculptures here, both good and bad. Will you,
                              who are of the profession, give me your opinion?"
                           She intended to prove to him that she was not his dupe and had never
                              taken him for a sculptor.
                           David, like most artists, was no critic. He knew a good work when he
                              saw it, but did not attempt to dissect its merits. He followed her,
                              obediently, through the rooms, stopping at every bronze or marble, and
                              settling the merits of each by a single word. He said, "This is good;
                              that is detestable! Here, is an amusing group; that one is stupid.
                              This group is the work of an artist; that of an ass!"
                           "What do you think of this figure, the infant Jesus?"
                           "It is very well."
                           "And this Philopœmon?"
                           "It is the masterpiece of modern sculpture."
                           
                           "Why?"
                           "Because it has never been excelled."
                           "And this Spartacus?"
                           "A good composition; but poorly executed."
                           "This Don Juan?"
                           "Middling."
                           "What! only middling? Why it is your own work."
                           "I know it."
                           "Let us stop here. I thank you for your lesson. I am as wise now as
                              you." "I wonder," she thought, "how he will set to work to take my
                              aunt! I don't intend to lose a single sitting."
                           When they returned, Mr. Smith and Mr. Livingston made a resolution to
                              keep a sharp watch on this young man, who circumvented the aunt, and
                              had tête-à-têtes with the niece.
                           Mrs. Stubbs now left her game, and said in a loud voice, "To-morrow
                              after breakfast, we shall begin on my busk. Whoever loves me will
                              come."
                           "Madam," cried both the suitors in the same breath.
                           That night David did not find his room quite so agreeable. His pockets
                              were empty. Such is man! no money—no illusions—perhaps that is the
                              reason why the rich are invariably so much happier than the poor.
                           
                           The next morning our artist rose and went with the first train back to
                              New York to dispose of his watch. He took good care not to go and tell
                              his mother that he had lost all his money playing cards. Such a
                              confession would have brought him a sound scolding. He preferred to go
                              to a pawnbroker, who lent him twenty dollars without explanations,
                              reproaches, or advice. Besides, what was the use of a watch at the
                              great house? there were a dozen mantel clocks, besides that in the
                              church tower. This last sounded nine as he reentered the gate on his
                              return, and found the family just sitting down to breakfast.
                           The guests of the evening before had left, except the two lovers. Mr.
                              Smith took a cup of weak tea. Mr. Livingston just tasted a bit of
                              salmon. Helen pecked like a bird at some cherries; while the sculptor
                              and the model resolutely devoured an enormous chicken pie. Madam
                              informed David his tools had arrived, with a horrible crate, full of
                              greasy clay, and that everything was ready.
                           The lovers were too eager to watch David not to sacrifice their usual amusements.
                              The captain usually went fishing, with a green barege veil tied over
                              his hat to preserve his complexion, while Mr. Smith fenced with Mr.
                              Douglas, or amused himself shooting crows. They all took a turn on the
                              lawn before the sitting, and Mrs. Stubbs told Livingston about David's
                              wonderful leap. He was highly amused at this novel way of entering a
                              gentleman's grounds.
                           "I think," said she, "that my friend Smith has met his match in
                              gymnastics."
                           "I don't pride myself on jumping ditches. However skilful we may
                              become at such exercises, there is a little animal that will always
                              surpass us."
                           "What's its name?" asked Mrs. Stubbs.
                           "The Kangaroo."
                           "I did not boast of it," said David, simply; "I could not find the
                              door."
                           "Do you fence, sir?"
                           "I do. Do you?"
                           "For the last fifteen years, at my academy."
                           "And I in my studio, with an old French officer."
                           "What, sir," cried Helen, "you fence? Papa will adore you."
                           As they walked back, Mrs. Stubbs said, "It does not offend you, does
                              it, that I have asked them to our sittings?"
                           "No, madam, if they do not hinder you from keeping your
                                 pose. As for me, I could work in the thunders of a
                              cannonade."
                           "Oh don't be afraid for me! I will keep as still as an Anabaptist.
                              Just notice these two lovers. What do you think of Mr. Smith?"
                           "I think him very fat!"
                           "Poor man! he does all he can to grow thin, except drinking vinegar.
                              And the captain?"
                           "Delicate. Boiled custard."
                           "He is, indeed! I am always wondering the wind does not blow him as
                              high as a kite. He ought to wear stones in his pockets. Which would
                              you choose for a husband, if you were a woman?"
                           "I think I should require a number of years for reflection."
                           "Wretch! don't say that to Helen! She has been reflecting
                              more than six months. Perhaps you think it singular that we should
                              have presented two lovers at once. That was my idea! My brother would
                              not desert Smith, and I clung to my captain. I said, "Let us invite
                              them both to the house;
                              Helen shall choose for herself. If she has any preference, however,
                              she takes mighty good care to conceal it. If you become friends with
                              her, try to find out. She is a perfect devourer of books and scribbler
                              of paper. She reads all day and writes all night. If I were a piece of
                              paper, I would know her thoughts in a twinkling."
                           Every one who has sat for a portrait knows that all of the first
                              sitting is consumed in choosing the attitude, arranging the light, and
                              various other preliminaries. Mrs. Stubbs' headdress alone took two
                              hours. The worthy lady had dreamt of a severely classical bust, with a
                              Pompadour headdress.
                           David found that his model had a Roman head, broad Dutch face, narrow
                              forehead, and small skull. He let the maid exhaust herself in making
                              an impossible topknot, about which everybody had some advice to give.
                              Then the sculptor asked permission to try in his turn; he turned back
                              his sleeves like a surgeon commencing an operation, and seizing the
                              comb, with a few twists made a most admirable coiffure, resembling an
                              ancient cameo. The maid held up her hands in astonishment. Mrs. Stubbs
                              did not know herself in the glass, and pretended they had given her a
                              new head like a doll; the lovers whispered the name of the fashionable
                              New York artist in hair; and Helen said to herself, "Did you ever! He
                              can dress hair! but wait, let us see if he can sculpture!"
                           "David now set to work to sketch her head, and then the real labor
                              began. No windmill in March when the wind jumps to all points of the
                              compass at once, was ever more restless than his model's head. She
                              found it was tedious to remain seated; so she consoled herself by
                              talking right and left, sense or nonsense, calling first one then
                              another, waving her arms like a telegraph, and beating on the carpet
                              with her foot. After an hour of this performance, she declared she was
                              so fatigued that the sitting must be postponed. Poor David had
                              expended more patience in those sixty minutes than a saint in sixty
                              years; and the bust was not even sketched.
                           "Just as I predicted," thought Helen.
                           "Oh," cried Mrs. Stubbs, bouncing out of her chair, "one's done, thank
                              Heaven! Eleven more, and we shall have finished."
                           David did not dare to say that if all the sittings were to be like the
                              first, it would not be finished in a hundred.
                           
                           This comical work lasted till the end of June; and the bust bore no
                              resemblance to humanity. Then Mrs. Stubbs began to suspect that the
                              presence of so much company was the cause. She told this to Helen—but
                              her niece would not admit it. She was sure that the handsome unknown
                              knew nothing of sculpture, and she was resolved to assist him in
                              concealing his ignorance. "What would become of us," she thought, "if
                              he were to confess the truth?"
                           So she made it her duty to disturb her aunt, interrupt David and
                              shorten the sittings. The poor artist thought with terror of his
                              debts, and cordially swore at his sitter and all her company, not
                              excepting Helen.
                           What astonished the incomparable Belinda most, was the singular and
                              obstinate silence of her lover. "Alas," she sighed, "of what use are
                              all his manœuvres and mine, if he cannot make up his mind to tell me
                              he loves me, and implore me to fly with him! Is he afraid of opening
                              his heart to me? Why don't he propose!"
                           Then to pique him into jealousy, she affected to favor Mr. Smith or
                              Mr. Livingston. She became for his sake a finished coquette; and
                              caused constant stant revolutions in the house. First Mr. Smith would
                              write triumphant letters to his family; and Mr. Livingston would talk
                              of packing his trunk. Daniel saw nothing. Then, the next day the wheel
                              had turned; and Mr. Livingston would be delighted and his rival in the
                              dismals; and all the time madam did not sit still one moment in her
                              chair; and David saw nothing but the mountains, rising between him and
                              his four hundred dollars.
                           "Why does he put off his declaration," still sighed Helen. She untied
                              and opened every bouquet the gardener brought to her room, hoping to
                              find a concealed note, and tore the flowers to atoms for spite at
                              being always disappointed.
                           On moonlight nights, she sat hours at her window, expecting a
                              serenade. If a gondola had floated by land to the very door of the
                              house; if she had seen descend from it a band of musicians; if little
                              negro pages, dressed in cherry-colored satin, had climbed to her bower
                              with caskets of jewels and fruits of China and Italy, such phenomena
                              would have astonished her less than the inscrutable silence of
                              David.
                           There did come at last, one night, as she sat at her window—the
                              atmosphere soft and love-breathing breathing—the sound of a magnificent
                              bass voice, singing in the garden. She could not distinguish the
                              words; but the music, which was new to her, seemed strangely dreamy
                              and melancholy. She leaned far out, hoping to catch a word, when her
                              aunt entered her room.
                           David, imagining that everybody was asleep, was walking about the
                              garden, smoking a cigar, and singing between each puff—a couplet of
                              that wild, 
                                 wierd
                                 weird
                              , witching song, common enough lately, in the streets of New
                              York: 
                                 
                                    "John Brown's body lies mouldering in the grave,
                                    John Brown's body lies mouldering in the grave,
                                    His soul is marching on."
                                 
                              
                           
                           Helen only heard the sad melody of the air. David sang, again; and the
                              soft wind blew a word or two to her ears.
                           "There," she cried to herself, "I heard 'soul,' and 'pet lamb,' and
                              'come.' But oh! why does he go so far away?"
                           It was just then that Mrs. Stubbs came in. Helen began talking very
                              loud to drown the serenade, which fortunately her aunt did not seem to
                              have heard.
                           
                              
                                 She leaned far out, hoping to catch a word—p. 280
                              
                           
                           
                           "I have a confounded headache," said Mrs. Stubbs, "Where's the
                              camphor? Or stop! since you are sitting up dressed; let us take a walk
                              in the garden; the open air will refresh me."
                           Helen made several excuses; but had to go, and she determined to take
                              her aunt as far as possible from the nightingale. Unluckily the breeze
                              seemed to freshen, and carried some notes to their ears.
                           "Hallo! listen!" exclaimed Mrs. Stubbs, "a serenade!"
                           "I heard nothing, aunt."
                           "Do you think I have no ears? I heard perfectly well. There!
                              Hark!"
                           "You are mistaken. It is your headache, aunt."
                           "No it is not my headache, you little goose! It is—yes!—It is—'John
                              Brown.'"
                           "Come away, aunt, I am afraid!"
                           "Afraid of Mr. Dow? But I tell you, he sings very well, whether he
                              works well or not. If his work only resembled his song. Come this way,
                              and we will surprise him."
                           Helen tremble like an aspen leaf. Her aunt led her within twenty yards
                              of the singer. The young girl coughed to warn him.
                           
                           David, composed as one of Homer's gods, thundered out another
                              verse.
                           "There! you see, I was right," said Mrs. Stubbs, "he is singing 'John
                              Brown.'"
                           "How very fortunate," thought Helen, "he had presence of mind to
                              change the song."
                           
                           Mr. Douglas was expected back the next morning. Mrs. Stubbs told at
                              breakfast how she had passed the night, listening to her artist, who
                              sang like a duck of a nightingale.
                           The lovers opened their eyes! When they learned that Helen had been
                              with her, their surprise turned to stupefaction! They knew not what to
                              do. They had never felt any particular liking for Mr. Dow; but now
                              they hated him. To be sure, madam had a right to choose her own
                              sculptor; but to take her niece out walking at midnight, with a
                              handsome young man, was carrying a joke too far altogether. After all
                              the sculptor was no Phœnix. His principal works were perched up on
                              clocks; he had labored two weeks on one bust, and nothing had come of
                              it; he was no wit; really, Mrs. Stubbs had seriously damaged the
                              family interests by her capers and caprices. In short, it was high
                              time for Mr. Douglas to come home.
                           Meanwhile no one thought of missing the sittings. David, discouraged
                              enough, raised for the fifteenth time the damp cloth which covered the
                              shapeless bust. The lovers looked at him with malicious pity, and
                              Helen, troubled by the expected arrival of her father, wondered how
                              the poor youth would get out of the scrape. She scolded her aunt, and
                              made her change her attitude twenty times.
                           "Are you in the vein to-day?" cried Mrs. Stubbs, "Come! be less
                              stupid! Last night you sung, and I was pleased. Now model!" and she
                              bounced half way round.
                           "Madam, I know your face perfectly well; and I shall make great
                              progress in an hour, if you will only keep still."
                           "Have your wish. I do not move. I say nothing. I sit. There!" and the
                              good lady made another bound in her chair, and a series of grimaces
                              fearful to behold. Then, unable to stop talking, she cried, "Silence!
                              I hope all the company will stop talking! Hm! If I were a pretty girl
                              like Helen, you would put more heart in your work, I know."
                           
                           "Mr. Dow," said Helen, watching his face, "do you think any one ever
                              became an artist by the power of love?"
                           "Certainly—on one condition."
                           "And what is that?"
                           "Not much; only ten or twelve years of labor."
                           "What a matter-of-fact man! You do not believe in the power of
                              love?"
                           "If any one should disbelieve," gallantly said Mr. Smith, "you would
                              soon convert them."
                           "Mr. Smith, if you are so complimentary, I shall not be able to reason
                              logically. Where were we? Oh! Aunt, hold yourself more erect!
                                 I say that love can work miracles. For instance, I am
                              a princess—say the princess of Belinda, daughter of the king of what
                              you please. I am riding in a carriage, drawn by four white
                              horses—no—by four white unicorns, that is prettier and more rare. A
                              shepherd, keeping his sheep sees me passing—he falls in love with me.
                              The next day he sends me a sonnet."
                           "By what means, pray?"
                           "By the air—under the wings of a carrier dove. That's the every-day
                              way. The sonnet is admirable! love has made him a poet."
                           "It has taught him a great deal more," said Mr. Livingston, "prosody,
                              orthography, the art of writing, to a man who knew nothing but driving
                              sheep; and all in one day; not to mention in addition the special laws
                              of a sonnet, which are somewhat complicated, I assure you."
                           "Well then—I give up poetry. But painting! A young Italian lady is in
                              the power of a cruel guardian, who insists upon her marrying an old
                              monster because he is rich. A handsome gentleman introduces himself in
                              the disguise of a celebrated painter. He has never handled the pencil,
                              but love guides his hand. Will you still say that such a thing has
                              never happened?"
                           "Certainly not—but I should like to see it," said David; "drawing is
                              not learned by nature; and as for coloring, there are members of the
                              academy who have never been able to learn it."
                           "Is that really true, Mr. Dow?"
                           "Yes, Miss Douglas."
                           "But you, who are a 
                                 scupltor
                                 sculptor
                              —is that too against me? Admit, that a gentleman, who never
                              handled a modelling tool, might by force of love, and to gain one he
                              loved make—a bust!"
                           "Really, six months ago, I would not have believed lieved it. Now I agree with you. I
                              believe in the miracles of love."
                           Helen felt herself turn pale. All the blood in her body rushed to her
                              heart.
                           "Is it a history?" she asked, with a trembling voice.
                           "A true one. I can tell it to you."
                           Mrs. Stubbs, during this conversation, had accidentally kept quite
                              still; and David vigorously plied his tools, while he told this
                              story:
                           "Six months ago I was finishing a group for the Spanish ambassador at
                              Washington, when I received a visit from an old schoolmate. He came to
                              New York to edit a paper. But the 'North Star,' or whatever its name
                              was, did not thrive; for my friend often needed a dollar. He used to
                              wear in January a cotton jacket and white hat.
                           "One day he met in my studio a young girl named Julia, who stood for
                              her feet and hands. She is very pretty and well behaved. My friend
                              Gray watched her for half an hour, as if he were stupefied. After she
                              left, he raved about her; never had seen any one so beautiful. She was
                              his fate. He insisted upon knowing her last name and residence; he was
                              ready to marry her that moment, and combine their two miserable lives
                              in one.
                           "I warned him—told him that the girl supported a cross old aunt, who
                              would not let her marry—all in vain. He begged me to send for her to
                              sit, even if I did not need her—he would be at all the expense; but I
                              paid very little attention to all this nonsense, for he acted like a
                              madman.
                           "For some days after I was away at work. On my return I found ten or
                              twelve notes from Gray in my studio. He had been to see Julia; she had
                              shut the door in his face. Then the poor fellow came to me and shed
                              bitter tears. 'Oh,' he exclaimed, 'why am I not a sculptor? then she
                              would come and sit to me, and I could look my fill on her lovely
                              face.'
                           "He asked me to lend him some tools. I gave him a handful. One month
                              after, in February, he came again. I hardly knew him; his eyes were
                              bright; his face animated; his step vigorous; he was almost singing.
                              What had not changed was his jacket and hat. He began to
                              talk immediately about Julia; he was more in love than ever; he now
                              hoped for a return; he had made her bust from memory; and gave me no
                              peace until I went with him
                              to see it. Over to Brooklyn, where he lived, we marched; and tired
                              enough we opened the door of his room.
                           "The bust was on the table. He raised the cloth—I did not then believe
                              in miracles—and I said, 'This is not your work.' I assure you, I would
                              willingly give all I have done, or expect to do, to have made that
                              wonderful bust of Julia. There was something simple and grand,
                              vigorous and passionate about it; it reminded you of the designs of
                              Albert Dürer—of the most beautiful sculptures of the middle ages. It
                              shone, that bust of reddish clay in the poor garret room, like a
                              masterpiece of light. I told the artist all my thoughts. He thanked
                              me, he embraced me, he was mad with joy; he saw the day before him
                              when Julia would come to his studio. I begged him to be at home the
                              next day at three; and I took with me two rich connoisseurs. They
                              shook hands with him; declared he would be a great artist and advised
                              him to send the bust in plaster to the Exhibition. I glanced round the
                              poverty-stricken room, and then at the gentlemen, and wondered where
                              the money for the casting was to be found. They understood; and when
                              they left, Gray found twenty dollars on the table. (Your head a little
                              more on one side, madam.")
                           "And what has become of this masterpiece?" said Mr. Smith, with a
                              sneer, "the public has not seen or the papers mentioned it."
                           "Alas, sir! love has acted like the tiger, and devoured his, children.
                              A week after my visit, I repeated it. I found Gray standing in front
                              of his house, his feet in the snow, smoking a pipe. I asked him what
                              he was about.
                           "'Don't you see?' he replied, 'I am amusing myself.' He
                                 looked broken-hearted.
                           "'But how about your love?'
                           "'Oh! to be sure. I went to Julia's with my bust under my arm. She
                              opened the door herself. I told her all I had done for the love of
                              her, and how I should become a great artist and implored her to come
                              and sit to me. She replied that she laughed at me, that I bored her,
                              and that I could take my stupid plaster away. I did not take it far; I
                              broke it against the first lamp post."
                           "Oh the hard-hearted girl!" exclaimed Helen, "has she ever
                              married?"
                           "Yes, she married an organ grinder, who earns about fifty cents a
                              day."
                           
                           "What joy! what happiness," 
                                 exlcaimed
                                 exclaimed
                               Mrs. Stubbs.
                           "What's the matter?" cried everybody.
                           "My busk! my busk! I am striking! it is I, myself! I leap to the
                              perception! my dear artist, I want to leap to your arms!"
                           And to his unspeakable amazement, she sprang up and kissed his
                              cheek.
                           The bust was not finished; but it had made more progress in those two
                              hours than in the two weeks before. Mrs. Stubbs, without knowing it,
                              had sat still as a mouse, during the whole of David's story; and he
                              had improved the golden chance to the utmost. Helen could not believe
                              her eyes. In her agitation she said, "Ah, sir, you have indeed proved
                              that love works miracles."
                           David thought she alluded to the history of Julia. He stood with
                              folded arms before his bust, saying to himself, "That story came in
                              the very nick of time; now for finishing without spoiling. I have time
                              yet. If these people will only let me alone, the plaster will be ready
                              in two weeks more, and then I can ask for some money."
                           "How much truth was there in that story?" mused Helen, "a masterpiece
                              made by love! a beautiful young girl marrying, an organ grinder! and
                              oh! by what spell has that lump of clay taken the shape of my
                              aunt."
                           
                           After the triumphant sitting David, radiant and joyful, ran to the
                              smoking room for his cigar case. He had time to smoke half an hour
                              before dinner. To go into the garden he had to pass through the
                              fencing room. He went in singing. Mr. Smith was there standing, at the
                              window, lost in thought; he was disgusted at the serenade, the success
                              of the morning, and the kiss which Mrs. Stubbs had so generously
                              bestowed on the sculptor. He felt an itching in his hands; he wanted
                              to kill somebody, to break somebody's bones. In this philanthropic
                              state of mind he looked longingly at the sharp sword's and buttoned
                              foils on the walls. David seemed to him sent by Providence. How
                              charming to strike that broad chest! he would give a fencing lesson to
                              Mr. Dow.
                           The young artist had no quarrel with Mr. Smith. He did not think him
                              handsome, and would not have taken his likeness for any money; but he
                              stopped to talk with him, examined the foils, and accepted a glove and
                              foil with the innocence of a lamb prepared pared for sacrifice. The warlike Smith
                              rushed upon him without crying "Look out," and hit him twenty times in
                              three minutes. It was like a hailstorm. At every thrust he murmured,
                              internally, "Take that for your music! that for your sculpture! that
                              to teach you how you meddle in my affairs!" David took them all,
                              saying every time he was touched, according to the rules of the game,
                              "a hit, a hit, a hit."
                           After five minutes of this work Mr. Smith stopped to take breath and
                              wipe his streaming forehead. David was as cool as before he crossed
                              foils. He looked at the purple face of his adversary, and thought to
                              himself, "I understand your game: now for my turn."
                           He firmly sustained a second assault more furious than the first;
                              parried, replied, did everything in its order, and returned, with
                              usury, the "waistcoat" he had received. But Mr. Smith would admit
                              nothing of the kind. Instead of crying "a hit" when he was touched, he
                              shouted, returning the thrust, "It was on the arm—on the neck—on the
                              thigh—bah!—the foil slipped then—bad thrust—a failure—we won't count
                              that—there's for you! that's what I call a deuce of a hit!"
                           "Pardon me, sir," said David, removing his mask, "if the button had
                              been taken off your foil I should not have received a single
                              scratch."
                           "Ouf!" cried Mr. Smith, panting, "I think we are of equal force."
                           "Faith, sir!" answered the artist, with charming frankness, "I think I
                              have beaten you."
                           "Not at all! I hit you every time."
                           "And I returned the compliment."
                           "Only once or twice."
                           "Well," said David, exasperated, "will you play once more to decide
                              it?"
                           "Shall we have time?" Mr. Smith went into the billiard room to look at
                              the clock. During his absence David quickly took down a sword
                              perfectly sharp, and exchanged it for Mr. Smith's foil. "We shall
                              see," he thought, then said aloud, "the game is one blow; he that
                              touches first, wins. On guard, sir!"
                           Mr. Smith seized his sword and ran like a madman at David, who kept
                              his guard splendidly. The angry man thrust again and again, and the
                              last time his sword brushed against the fore-arm of the artist.
                           "Ah! I touched you, sir."
                           
                           "I think not," replied David.
                           "You are mistaken, sir. I am very sure that you were hit full in the
                              breast."
                           "If you are sure, sir—"
                           "Perfectly."
                           "Then, how happens it that I am a living man?"
                           "I do not understand you, sir."
                           "Have the kindness to look at the point of your sword."
                           Mr. Smith gave a bounce of astonishment and mortification.
                           "This is a terrible joke of yours, sir. You have exposed me to the
                              risk of killing you."
                           "Spare your regrets, sir. I was sure you would not touch me."
                           At this moment Mrs. Stubbs, Helen, her father, and Mr. Livingston came
                              in, or the argument would have become a sharp quarrel.
                           "What a man!" thought Helen. "It is exactly like an old romance."
                           Then David was presented to Mr. Douglas, who had just arrived; and as
                              they were walking in to dinner, Helen whispered to the artist, "Mr.
                              Dow, I forbid you ever to risk your life again."
                           "That little girl is making love to me," thought the simple
                              sculptor.
                           
                           At dinner Mr. Douglas studied David's face, while Mrs. Stubbs praised
                              him in every form and tone of admiration. Helen was in ecstacies, Mr.
                              Smith sulky, and Mr. Livingston stupid. As for the hero, he did not
                              lose a single mouthful.
                           The company separated earlier than usual: Helen to read, Mr. Douglas
                              to ask his sister a hundred questions, the lovers to consult together
                              how to defeat David, and he, good man! to sleep like a top till next
                              morning.
                           "My dear sister," said Mr. Douglas, "how do our lovers get on? What
                              says Helen?"
                           "Just the same as ever, she says nothing; but I think if she has a
                              preference it is for Livingston. Ah! that is a name! We do not marry a
                              man, but a name. A woman may go out without her husband; but whether
                              she will or no, her name goes with her. In company, people who admire
                              her do not ask whether her husband is big or little—they say, 'What's
                              the name of that pretty woman.' The name! You see it
                              eclipses everything—dress, fortune tune, or beauty! It is the most
                              important thing in life. To think that I should be eternally called
                              'Mrs. Stubbs' not that I blame my husband—he is gone, and I lived in
                              peace with him. I loved him in spite of his name and his other faults;
                              but why in the name of justice couldn't he have taken his direful
                              'Stubbs' to the other world when he went? I can only resign myself to
                              my fate on one condition—Helen shall never marry a Stubbs."
                           "Smith is not a bad name—"
                           "Oh no! There are only three millions of them; and Helen shall not be
                              one more."
                           Mr. Douglas had excellent reasons of his own for favoring Smith. He
                              had an ardent desire not to be the last of his family; he knew Smith
                              would consent to take his name; and Livingston never; so he urged:
                           "But Livingston, my good sister, is poor; and if you should take the
                              idea in your head to marry again, Helen, married to Smith, would
                              suffer no loss."
                           "Me marry! me!! You are, crazy. Who would want to marry an antiquity
                              like me? I know Helen prefers Livingston, and I shall give them five
                              thousand a year. She can't eat more than that, her teeth are so small.
                              Come to her room. I warrant you she is up reading. We will make her
                              confess."
                           Helen, the silent one, now sure of being loved since the miracle of
                              the bust, was full of joy. Happiness, so long constrained, rose to her
                              lips, and when her father and aunt entered and exhorted her to declare
                              her preference, she grew radiant.
                           "Smith or Livingston; choose!" cried Mrs. Stubbs.
                           "Neither the one or the other," she replied.
                           "And why not, niece?"
                           "Because I don't love them, aunt."
                           "What are you talking about! When I married Mr. Stubbs, I esteemed—I
                              made the most of his qualities; but I did not love him any more than
                              loved the emperor of China. Love grows slowly: only weeds spring up
                              rapidly."
                           "Dear aunt, does a man ever marry a woman without loving her?"
                           "I did not say any such thing! Don't talk nonsense!"
                           "Neither of these gentlemen love me."
                           "How did you find that out?"
                           "Well, I will tell you. Mr. Livingston is a man of good birth, well educated, and
                              of agreeable manners."
                           "Ah-ha!" cried Mrs. Stubbs, triumphantly. "Wait a minute. Mr. Smith
                              has vivacity, a good voice, and money."
                           "Eh! eh!" ejaculated Mr. Douglas.
                           "Patience, father! The one is fair, the other brown and red; the one
                              poor, the other rich. Yet they seem like one and the same person to
                              me. They pay me the same stupid compliments, as if they had learned
                              them out of a book. They look at me with the same expression. If I
                              laugh, they rejoice together; if I frown, they both become images of
                              despair. They invariably turn the conversation upon marriage, and each
                              tries to prove what a pattern husband he will make. If my aunt says a
                              word against avarice, they give a dollar to the first beggar at the
                              gate. If she praises prudence, they search for pins on the carpet.
                              That is not the way people love!"
                           "What do you know about it, you little goose!"
                           "I feel it. The heart is clear-sighted at my age. If those gentlemen
                              were in love with me, my heart would tell me so, and I should at least
                              be grateful. They are not courting me. It is my
                                 money."
                           Mr. Douglas was astonished and struck by his daughter's animated words
                              and manner. He took both her hands and drew her close to him, and
                              said—
                           "Look me in the eyes. Do you love any one?"
                           Helen embraced him.
                           "You do. Is he of good family?"
                           "As a king."
                           "Rich?"
                           "As my aunt."
                           "Handsome?"
                           "As you, my dear father, and proud and intelligent as you are."
                           "Do we know him?"
                           "You have seen him, but do not know him."
                           "Where did you meet him?"
                           "At the ball last winter."
                           "That's an age ago."
                           "Yes, I heard not a word of him in six months."
                           "Then he has forgotten you."
                           "Oh no! father."
                           "How do you know that?"
                           "I have the proofs."
                           "I do not ask if you have corresponded, for you are my daughter."
                           
                           "Oh! father."
                           "Who is he, then; tell us his name?"
                           Helen became confused, and Mrs. Stubbs said:
                           "You have frightened her, poor little soul! leave her with me, she
                              will tell me her secret."
                           I do not know how Helen contrived to bewitch her aunt, but not only
                              did she not tell the name of the new lover, but she managed to make
                              her promise to help in a plot against the old ones.
                           Love is a great teacher of stratagem, and Helen soon concocted a
                              brilliant scheme. "We will prove," she said to her aunt, "that they
                              want your money." She cut out of one of the old romances this
                              sentence, and enclosed it to Mr. Smith. "The lady and
                              her niece were married the same day to the two knights they loved; and
                              the persons invited to the castle chapel witnessed two beautiful
                              ceremonies."
                           "Now let us consider," said the aunt. "When the servant shall have
                              carried him this precious epistle, he will not throw it in the fire,
                              for it is summer. He will read it. What will he think?
                              First, that some one is laughing at him. A trick! a bad joke! When I
                              was about to marry Mr. Stubbs, my father received about twenty
                              anonymous letters. They declared my intended had eleven wives in
                              Turkey. Well, then, Smith will scratch his head, and say, 'What a fool
                              Mrs. Stubbs is to marry again, with her gray head and mustaches! If
                              she marries, the consequence is clear—the girl loses the fortune.'
                              He'll be off, depend upon it! But Livingston would marry you, fortune
                              or not—he's a gentleman. But let me see! how shall I make Smith
                              believe I have a husband in my mind. He knows perfectly well that for
                              a wonder we have not had fourteen visits in fourteen days. To get
                              married, there must be a husband. Ah! I have it! The sculptor!!"
                           "Oh, aunt!"
                           "Why not? he is very handsome."
                           "No doubt, but—"
                           "He has talent."
                           "Yes, aunt; but—"
                           "He has a ridiculous name, to be sure, but he will make it famous.
                              What I love in artists is, that they are all gentlemen."
                           "But just think, aunt."
                           "That he has not a cent? Oh, I don't care for that! I am rich enough
                              for both. After all, the marriage would not be half as bad as that of
                              Mrs. Brown with her gardener."
                           
                           "Oh yes, aunt! but what a part you will make the poor young man
                              play!"
                           "Oh! you think an unhappy part, do you? Not at all. I shall be
                              charming to him. I shall pay him compliments. I shall walk on the lawn
                              with him; and help him to the chicken's wings, while I make Smith eat
                              bones. Besides, he will suspect nothing; my manœuvres will only be
                              understood by the initiated."
                           So the good old lady told Mr. Douglas that Helen's talk was all a
                              young girl's dreaming fancy. She sent for a friend to visit her with a
                              son and daughter, both having large independent fortunes; and she
                              wrote to Miss Livingston, an elder sister of her candidate, to whom
                              she still clung, to come and help her scare off the enemy.
                           But that respectable lady did not hurry herself; and when she arrived,
                              Smith was already paying court to Miss Kent, the rich young lady, and
                              David putting the last touches on Mrs. Stubbs' bust. The artist had
                              observed nothing; the cooling off of Smith; the violent petting of his
                              model; or the happiness of Helen. He saw nothing but his four hundred
                              dollars; he did not take the slightest notice of the glances of Helen,
                              or her hints, which he did not understand. The attentions of Mrs.
                              Stubbs won his heart; he did not doubt that so kind an old lady would
                              advance him the money he needed so much. Full of this faith, he had
                              hurried his work, and had finished it with remarkable success, under
                              the spur of necessity. Those who saw him working so industriously
                              said, "How deeply he is in love! Who would have believed that the
                              evident passion of Mrs. Stubbs should have been shared by so young and
                              handsome a man? He will marry her for money, and also for love!"
                           No one doubted this state of things, except Helen and Mr. Livingston.
                              Mr. Douglas himself became frightened, and thought of reprimanding his
                              venerable sister.
                           But Mr. Smith laughed in his sleeve. Seeing his rival more than ever
                              in love, he congratulated himself on having received the mysterious
                              note, and figured to himself the captain's despair, when David should
                              go with Mrs. Stubbs to the altar. He did not think Helen half so
                              pretty, now that he knew she would lose her aunt's fortune; and he
                              devoted himself to the young lady from the city, who encouraged him
                              assiduously.
                           Mr. Douglas, scandalized by the behavior of his candidate, began to think better of Mr.
                              Livingston. He repented having ever consented to such an absurd
                              scheme; he trembled lest some gossip about it should arise, and his
                              daughter suffer; he felt the necessity of pressing Helen's marriage;
                              so he contrived in two or three secret interviews to open his heart to
                              Livingston on the subject of the change of name. Mr. Livingston was
                              open to offers, when such a large fortune was the prize. To Mr.
                              Douglas's surprise, he agreed to everything. The bargain made, he told
                              his sister, who had just arrived, the great news. "Really, Mr.
                              Livingston Douglas is not so bad," he said. His sister embraced him
                              with joy, and exclaimed:
                           "I have come just in time to bless you. That is the reason Mrs. Stubbs
                              wrote for me in such haste."
                           
                           The morning of the 13th July was a Friday; a day of doubly bad augury.
                              Miss Livingston had used her eyes, done a little questioning, and knew
                              all that was going on in the house. After breakfast she took her
                              brother on one side and said, "What is the personal fortune of Miss
                              Helen?"
                           "I don't know: nothing—while her father lives. But why do you ask? Her
                              aunt is to settle a large fortune on her."
                           "Mr. David Dow's fortune, I suppose."
                           "What the deuce are you talking about?"
                           "My poor brother, you know nothing! Mrs. Stubbs is going to marry the
                              sculptor. Every one in the house knows it, except you. This is why Mr.
                              Smith drew back!"
                           "Good heavens!"
                           Mr. Livingston rushed out of the room. Never in his life had he had
                              such a color. His whiskers, as white as linen, seemed to turn red. He
                              nearly tumbled over Mrs. Stubbs, who took him kindly by the arm, and
                              said, "Where are you running to? I make you my prisoner. You have
                              behaved like an angel! Mr. Smith is a brute! I am delighted your
                              sister has come, and you shall have my niece."
                           He looked rather rudely at his faithful ally, and replied dryly,
                              "Thank you, madam! I think some one is being deceived here, and I
                              shall try not to be the dupe!"
                           Mrs. Stubbs stood transfixed! She imagined a lamb had broken loose. He
                              made a profound bow to the astonished woman, and ran to David, who was walking by the lake
                              with the young gentleman from the city, Mr. Kent.
                           "Mr. Sculptor," said he in an angry tone, "you have made a jest of me
                              long enough! and I feel obliged to tell you, that I like neither
                              cheats nor intriguers."
                           Mr. Kent seemed stupefied at this; and David looked at the captain as
                              a doctor in an insane asylum would look at a madman: at last he
                              said:
                           "Are you speaking to me, sir?"
                           "To you yourself."
                           "And you call me a cheat; an intriguer?"
                           "And an impudent fellow, if the other titles do not sufficiently paint
                              your likeness."
                           David asked himself whether he should catch the captain up and throw
                              him into the lake; but an after thought came; he pulled off his glove
                              and threw it in Mr. Livingston's face.
                           Never was a duel worse conducted than David's and Mr. Livingston's.
                              The captain had never used a sword in his life, and his pistols,
                              loaded twelve years before, on the occasion of his first and last
                              voyage, remained untouched. David, skilled in all weapons, had never
                              tried his skill or strength, save when he threw the impudent plumber
                              out of his mother's window. No one ever before had been his own enemy
                              enough to insult David; and he, who knew so well how to fight, was, as
                              is usually the case, the most peaceable of mortals. All his friends
                              were artists, confined to their studios by taste and profession; so he
                              had never even been called on as a second.
                           Mr. Livingston chose for his seconds young Kent, with whom David had
                              been walking at the time of the quarrel, and Smith; the latter was too
                              prudent to expose himself to a chance of imprisonment, and declined;
                              but young Kent, almost a child, felt very grand in his new part. He
                              undertook to find another second among his young friends at the New
                              York club, and marched off to the city, his coat buttoned up to the
                              throat, his hands in his pockets, his eyes half shut, and his face
                              full of important discretion. The last thing he thought of was the
                              lives of these two men.
                           The captain, outraged at the insult and the ruin of his hopes with
                              Helen, was all impatience for the duel. I do not know that he wanted
                              to kill David, but a lucky shot might break off his marriage with Mrs.
                              Stubbs, and give her fortune back to her niece.
                           
                           The artist, on the other hand, had no time to lose: his rent was due
                              on the 15th and his workmen could not afford to wait. He employed the
                              rest of the day in finishing his bust. At five o'clock he told Mrs.
                              Stubbs he was engaged to dine in the city, and started for New
                              York.
                           He counted upon two friends who had lately joined the army. But he
                              found their regiment had started while he was away. In despair he went
                              to the studios of two artist friends, who had coolness but no
                              experience, and not the faintest idea about duelling. He begged them
                              to remain at home to receive Mr. Livingston's seconds.
                           These two children were at their club. David brought them at nine
                              o'clock in the evening the address of his two friends. He met Mr.
                              Livingston as he went out, who saluted him with a profound bow.
                           At ten o'clock the four seconds opened at one of the studios a very
                              remarkable conference. None of them knew the occasion of the duel.
                              They only knew that Mr. Livingston had insulted David, who had
                              insulted him in return. David himself was ignorant of the captain's
                              cause of quarrel. His ultimatum, reduced to writing, was neither long
                              nor complicated: "I have nothing against Mr. Livingston; he called me
                              'a cheat, an intriguer, and impudent;' why, I do not know. Attacked in
                              my honor I threw my glove in his face. If he takes back what he has
                              said, I shall regret what I did. If not; I desire the duel shall take
                              place to-morrow forenoon. If I have the choice of weapons, I demand
                              the sword."
                           Mr. Livingston might have easily chosen more skilful seconds, but he
                              took these boys to avoid explanations.
                           Then Mr. Kent said, "Gentlemen, Mr. Dow has thrown his glove in Mr.
                              Livingston's face; we are ordered to inquire the reason?"
                           Not a rule of duelling was observed. David's seconds did not even know
                              the names of Livingston's. Not a word was said about Helen, or the
                              pretended intrigues of David, or the possible mistake of the
                              captain—which was just what Livingston wanted.
                           Of course an arrangement was impossible. Mr. Livingston was furious,
                              and David was not sorry to read him one of those lessons which are
                              remembered for six weeks afterward in bed; and therefore he chose the
                              sword.
                           
                           The seconds, if the truth must be told, were all young, and wanted to
                              see something of a duel. If you wish to arrange a quarrel, never
                                 select young seconds.
                           
                           The conference lasted just half an hour. War is declared much sooner
                              than peace is concluded. The meeting was arranged to take place at an
                              unfrequented grove, a mile from Mr. Douglas' house, at six o'clock the
                              next morning.
                           The choice of weapons belonged to neither, as the offence was
                              reciprocal; and they agreed to draw for it on the field.
                           Just as the young men were taking leave, Mr. Kent asked, "By the by,
                              gentlemen, have you arms?"
                           "No, sir. Have you?"
                           "No—we have none either; we must purchase them."
                           "But that will excite suspicion. What shall we do?"
                           "Ah! now I think of it, Mr. Livingston has pistols. Will you be
                              willing to use them?"
                           "Why not?" said the painter ingenuously.
                           "If they are good, so much the better for the good shot; if bad, they
                              will do no harm."
                           "Oh, doubtless they are good," said Mr. Kent.
                           "Well, then, there will be no trouble. Mr. Dow has several swords in
                              his studio."
                           During this extraordinary conference, David had reached his humble
                              home. He had been home very regularly every Sunday, to accompany his
                              good mother to church and attend to her wants.
                           "I only want you, my son," was her invariable answer.
                           This evening she did not expect him; she had gone to bed at nine
                              o'clock, and was in a sound sleep. David entered his studio softly;
                              took down a pair of swords, dusted them, bent the blades, and saw that
                              the handles were firm.
                           Wrapping them up in a green cloth, he took them down stairs. "A nice
                              couple of lancets," thought he, "to bleed Mr. Livingston with. My poor
                              mother will be a little frightened, when I tell her my adventures next
                              Sunday. Bah!"
                           He was about to leave the house, when some unknown power drew him
                              back. He crept softly up stairs, entered his mother's room, and
                              approached the bed. A night lamp shed a feeble ray through the room.
                              Mrs. Dow, in the midst of sketches, casts, bronzes, and a thousand
                              little works of her son's, smiled as she slept.
                           
                           She was dreaming of him, honored and famous. David gazed tenderly down
                              on her kind face for a moment; then kneeling beside her, he kissed the
                              small wrinkled hand that lay outside of the clothes, and then he took
                              a corner of the white sheet and wiped the big tears from his eyes. He
                              hurried out to catch the train; and on arriving at the house, slipped
                              quietly to his room, hid his swords, brushed the dust from his
                              clothes, and descended to the parlor.
                           They were playing a round game of cards, late as it was. In five
                              minutes more Mr. Livingston and Mr. Kent entered. They had come on
                              another car, in the same train.
                           "At last," cried Mrs. Stubbs, "I am thankful I have got all my
                              boarders back. For the last five hours I have been like a hen who has
                              lost her chickens. Peter, get supper ready. You seem, gentlemen, to
                              have left us by agreement; you don't deserve any supper. Come, my dear
                              sculptor, sit by me; let me make you some lemonade; ah, I forgot! you
                              don't like it. Pass the sugar to Mr. Livingston. He looks as if he
                              needed it badly."
                           The captain's hand trembled as he took the sugar bowl from David.
                              Young Kent, buttoned up tighter than ever, looked like the young
                              traitor in a melodrama. He tried to eat a piece of cake, but it stuck
                              fast in his throat.
                           After supper David exchanged a whisper with Mr. Kent: "Does it come
                              off to-morrow?"
                           "Yes."
                           "What arms are to be used?"
                           "This will be decided by lot."
                           "I have my swords here."
                           "And we our pistols. We will go out by the small gate; you by the
                              large one, to avoid suspicion. Everybody will be asleep, as they have
                              sat up so late."
                           Mr. Livingston took his pistols from his trunk. They had not been
                              fired off, as I have related, for twelve years; so he changed the
                                 caps. He wrote a long letter to his sister; then threw
                              himself dressed on his bed, and did not once close his eyes.
                           David slept like the great Condé or Alexander on the eve of a battle.
                              At half-past five he was up and dressed. The two men went out without
                              waking any one; Mr. Livingston leaving on his table the letter to his
                              sister.
                           All were punctual at the place of meeting. The seconds from the city had slept in the
                              village. They all came on foot, David leading the way.
                           "How composed you are!" said his friend, the painter, to him.
                           "I am, if we fight with swords. With these infernal pistols, I can
                              answer for nothing. I shall kill my man."
                           "Good gracious! how so?"
                           "It is a very simple thing. Sword in hand, I am very sure he can't
                              touch me, and I can take care of him. With the pistols there is no
                              mercy for the unskilful, because they may shoot you through the head,
                              without knowing how to take aim. Advise them, for their own sakes, to
                              choose swords."
                           Mr. Livingston instructed his seconds to
                                 refuse the swords. "Then," said Mr. Kent, "you are
                              accustomed to the pistol."
                           "I? Not at all."
                           "Does he shoot any better."
                           "Yes; I am told he can hit the bull's eye nineteen times out of
                              twenty."
                           "Good heaven! Then why not take the swords."
                           "I will tell you by-and-by."
                           They had now arrived at the grove. A place in the centre, about twenty
                              by forty feet, had been cleared, and was as level as a floor. Mr. Kent
                              threw up a half dollar; the painter cried "tail," it came up head.
                           The pistols were chosen; and nothing remained to be done but to settle
                              and mark the distance. Mr. Kent, by this time, was pretty well
                              frightened out of his conceit and importance; and was confused in his
                              talk. The other young fellow was in tears.
                           "Put us at forty paces," said David, "and let him fire first. He will
                              miss me, and I will fire in the air."
                           Then Mr. Kent walked up with a proposition from his man.
                           "Gentlemen," said he, "Mr. Livingston has never fired a pistol. Mr.
                              Dow is a dead shot. The only way to equalize the chances is to fire
                              off one of the pistols, and draw lots who shall have it. The two
                              adversaries shall stand at five paces."
                           "But that is butchering," said David.
                           "We never will accede to it!" cried his seconds.
                           "Then," said Mr. Kent, with a sigh of satisfaction, "the duel is
                              impossible; and the affair must be arranged."
                           
                           "Well, then, arrange it," cried David. "I don't thirst for any man's
                              blood and; I am quite ready to pardon the compliments the captain has
                              paid me."
                           "May I tell him what you say?" cried young Kent, almost skipping with
                              joy.
                           "Certainly."
                           You perceive that all the prescribed forms of duelling etiquette were
                              utterly ignored on this occasion. Here was David talking on the field
                              with his adversary's seconds!
                           "He is disposed to make up, I'm sure," said Kent to the captain. "He
                              will pardon all you said to him; the affair is half settled."
                           "What a hero!" answered Livingston, who, like all small souls, when
                              they fancied the danger was over, began to bluster. "He refuses to
                              fight when the chance is equal. Go ask him what apology he will make
                              for the brutality of his conduct."
                           Again young Kent trotted over, and addressing himself to David, said,
                              "Mr. Livingston hears with pleasure that you forgive his language, and
                              hopes you will give him another proof of your politeness, by asking
                              his pardon for—"
                           David heard no more. "Sir," he thundered, "I ask pardon of no one;
                              particularly of a man who has insulted me without the slightest cause.
                              Discharge one of the pistols!!"
                           "But, sir—"
                           "No 'buts,' I beg. The shortest jokes are best; and this has lasted
                              much too long already."
                           He was grand in his rage; his eyes flamed, his frame dilated, his
                              black locks waved magnificently over his forehead with his fiery
                              energy. His seconds tried to calm, him; but he would listen to
                              nothing. The other, very much cooled off, sent young Kent again; but;
                              David replied that he did not want explanations, but pistols.
                           Mr. Livingston, pale as death, gave the pistols to his seconds. David
                              examined them with particular attention. "Thick barrels," he said,
                              "very stiff triggers. Who loaded them?"
                           "The gunsmith, when they were bought."
                           "Have you powder and ball?"
                           "Yes. Do you wish us to load them again, before you?"
                           "No, it's no matter." He took one, and fired it in the air.
                           "They are well loaded," he said. "Be kind enough to replace the
                              cap."
                           
                           The two pistols were now wrapped in a handkerchief. Mr. Livingston
                              chose one; David the other. The painter, who had tremendous legs, took
                              five of his longest strides. The other seconds retired sobbing.
                           "Gen-tle-men," sobbed poor young Kent; "I—I—will clap my hands—three
                              times. Fire—when you please."
                           David fired first; his cap only exploded; his pistol was not
                              loaded.
                           Mr. Livingston, paler than ever, kept his position some seconds, his
                              arm extended, his pistol pointed at David. His legs trembled beneath
                              him; his eyes swam; his body swayed like a willow in the breeze. In
                              such moments, seconds of time become years.
                           David, with his breast partly protected by his arm, his head by his
                              pistol, lost patience.
                           "Fire, sir!" he cried.
                           "Fire, sir," repeated the seconds, mechanically. Any misfortune seemed
                              preferable to that dreadful suspense.
                           The captain, without lowering his hand, replied in a quivering voice,
                              "Sir, your life is at my disposal; but I hate to take it. Do beg my
                              pardon."
                           "No, sir! Fire!!"
                           "If I fire, sir, I shall be an assassin. Beg my pardon."
                           "Never, sir! If you do notfire, you are a
                                 coward!"
                           "SIR!!!!"
                           "You will miss me; your hand trembles!"
                           "Do not drive me to extremities!"
                           David did not think of death, or his mother, or his art. He was
                              infuriated to feel that his life was in the power of this man.
                           "Fire!" he cried again. Young Kent advanced a step, exclaiming, "Oh!
                              this is too much."
                           "Stop," said the artist, "I will find a way to give him courage;" and
                              he put his left hand in his pocket to feel for his gloves.
                           The pistol went off; but—it was Livingston who fell. Every one ran to
                              him, David the first. The pistol had burst, and the captain's arm was
                              broken.
                           David's two seconds took off their silk cravats, and bound up the
                              arm.
                           "It will not amount to anything," said David.
                           "Why the deuce did you want apologies from me, when I had done
                              nothing?"
                           "Forgive me, sir, and be happy. May she you love—"
                           
                           "I?"
                           "You."
                           "Am I in love with Miss Douglas?"
                           "No! with Mrs. Stubbs."
                           The poor artist looked at Mr. Livingston's head, to see if it had not
                              been touched with a piece of the pistol; but the cranium seemed
                              intact. David picked up the stock of the pistol, and examined it with
                              the air of a connoisseur. "Who loaded this pistol for you?" he
                              asked.
                           "The gunsmith."
                           "Exactly; but in what year?"
                           "In 1850."
                           "I should think so."
                           
                           The captain, resting on David's arm, walked painfully back to the
                              village; where, meeting the doctor, he took them to his own house and
                              dressed the wound, while Mr. Kent ran to the great house to reassure
                              Miss Livingston.
                           Her first night had been a sleepless one. Struck by the strange looks
                              and manner of her brother, she tossed and dreamed uneasily till
                              daylight; when she arose, dressed herself, and knocked at the door of
                              his room. As she got no answer, she entered without ceremony, found
                              the room empty, and the fatal letter on the table. It contained the
                              particulars of the quarrel, the errand on which he was bound, and his
                              will in case of accident. The poor woman, horribly frightened, could
                              just crawl out of the room, and awake Mrs. Stubbs, who awoke her
                              brother, who hunted up Mr. Smith. Helen, who was always early, hearing
                              the noise, came down soon after; and Mrs. Kent and her daughter were
                              not long in following.
                           I verily believe if Mr. Douglas's ancestors had been buried on the
                              lawn, they would have awakened and joined the party; such a terrible
                              lamentation did every one set up! Never had such a hullaballoo been
                              known in the house before. Mrs. Stubbs and Miss Livingston looked
                              considerably the worse for their hasty toilet; but Helen, her hair
                              falling down, her white robe flowing, agitated and excited but not
                              frightened, looked as handsome as an angel. At the first word she
                              heard, she understood everything.
                           "Don't be alarmed!" she cried, "nothing will happen to him! I know
                              him! he is the invincible man!"
                           "My brother?" asked Miss Livingston.
                           
                           "We are not talking about your brother; but don't be afraid, David
                              will spare him."
                           If lionesses talk in the desert, it is thus they must speak of the
                              lions.
                           There was no need of asking Helen to explain herself. A woman is never
                              ashamed of the man who fights for her. Without hesitation, she turned
                              her glowing face to her father, and told the short story, so full of
                              incident, which the month had developed; the discretion of David, his
                              courage, and the wonderful talent his love had created in him.
                           As she finished, Mr. Douglas began, to reflect that he had paid too
                              much attention to his business, and not enough to his family. Mrs.
                              Stubbs found she was a fool. Mr. Smith winked and blinked and rubbed
                              his eyes, and Miss Livingston could not make up her mind whether to be
                              frightened or scandalized. Helen's passion broke out like those fires
                              which have been smouldering for days on board of a ship. A hatch is
                              opened, and all is in a flame! Her father would rather have been
                              informed of this wonderful mystery before fewer people. But upon the
                              whole, he concluded to appear pleased.
                           As for Mrs. Stubbs, the most fickle and the queerest of women, she
                              passed in a twinkling from astonishment to enthusiasm. I would not be
                              willing to aver that her ancient heart had remained insensible to the
                              fascination of the handsome sculptor. She might have imagined it not
                              impossible to take him in earnest for a husband—but there was no
                              objection to having him for her nephew. "It is all the same," she
                              thought.
                           However, she reminded her niece of the marvellous unknown, of whom she
                              had spoken a fortnight since, as noble as a king, as rich as herself,
                              as handsome as ——.
                           "But, aunt, this is he," cried Helen, in a perfectly confident tone;
                              "don't you understand he has concealed his name, and taken the name of
                              the artist in whose studio you found him? Only wait till he returns,
                              he will tell us all. As for his fortune, can you think, it as small as
                              he pretends. You have not observed with what contempt he, speaks of
                              money."
                           
                           The lower part of the house, where David lived in the city was
                              occupied by a baker. When his little daughter brought the morning loaf
                              up to Mrs. Dow, she said,
                              "As Mr. David came home so late last night, you must have been
                              abed."
                           "What? when do you mean?"
                           "I mean he came home last night, ma'am."
                           "You must be mistaken—he is not home."
                           "I am sure, ma'am, for I was playing at the door; he took away a long
                              bundle, wrapped in green cloth."
                           The poor mother rushed into the studio; looked round, missed the
                              swords, and nearly fainted with fear. She put on her best dress and
                              hurried to the depot, and in an hour was at Mr. Douglas's mansion.
                           She met him at the hall door. "Oh sir", she cried, "it is just what I
                              feared. I said to him, 'David, there is a pretty young lady; do take
                              care not to with in love with her;' but he is such a big fool!"
                           At this moment Helen made her appearance, and thought the manners and
                              dress of the good woman had not the remotest resemblance to what ought
                              to have been those of the queenly mother of the Prince of Silver; the
                              romance-bitten girl had but one thought, "He loves me! he has told his
                              parent!" and she immediately embraced the old woman, who was
                              overwhelmed with this unexpected honor.
                           At last young Kent arrived, and gave such a comforting account of the
                              duel, that everybody felt relieved, except Miss Livingston who ordered
                              the carriage, and drove immediately to the village.
                           Hardly had she gone, when David also arrived, and requested a private
                              interview with Mrs. Stubbs.
                           "Ah ha!" she said with a chuckle; "all of you stay here; he wants to
                              confess to me."
                           She ran into the hall, caught him by the hand, and drew him into the
                              library.
                           "Oh ho, sir," she cried with her customary bluntness, "we hear fine
                              news about you!"
                           David was far more agitated than when he had told Mr. Livingston to
                              fire. He replied humbly:
                           "Dear madam, I beg your forgiveness, I swear to you, that if I had not
                              been grossly insulted, I should never have shown such disrespect to
                              the laws of hospitality. Besides, I fired in the air. Mr. Livingston
                              wounded himself."
                           "We know all that. What more?"
                           "I understand, madam, that after such an affair, it is impossible for
                              me to remain under your roof. I have therefore come to take leave of
                              you, and to thank you
                              heartily for a reception, the kindness of which I shall never
                              forget."
                           "What on earth is the man talking about?"
                           "Your bust, I am rejoiced to tell you, is finished; and, with your
                              permission, I will execute it in marble at home."
                           "Bust? Fiddlestick! What else?"
                           "What else?—madam—"
                           "Have you not something to ask me?"
                           "It is true, I have, dear madam; and since you encourage me to—"
                           "Certainly! speak up! I'm all right!"
                           "Well, then, I have to pay my rent to-morrow; if you will have the
                              kindness to advance me two hundred dollars on the bust, I—"
                           "Oh certainly! Of course, as much as you please! Now! what more?"
                           "After that, madam, I have only to thank you."
                           "Fudge! I know all. Go on!"
                           "All what, madam?"
                           "All, I tell you! You love my niece?"
                           "No! madam; I swear I do not!!!"
                           "But I swear you do! Why did you risk your life on the cast of a die
                              against Mr. Livingston's? Tell me that!"
                           "Because he insulted me."
                           "Why did you try to get killed by that frightful Smith?"
                           "Because he made me nervous."
                           "Bah! That's a pretty reason; I don't believe a word of it! Come!
                              confess now between ourselves that you are crazy for Helen."
                           "Mrs. Stubbs, may I die if—"
                           "Oh don't die! She loves you!"
                           David, at this announcement, was sincerely grieved.
                           "My dear madam," he earnestly exclaimed, "I have been grossly
                              scandalized! By my mother's head—"
                           "Your mother is here and admitted that you love Helen. Will you have
                              her for your wife?"
                           "This joke is very cruel, madam. Whatever my demerits may be—I do not
                              think I have deserved—"
                           "Yes you have! You have deserved the hand of my niece; I tell you you
                                 shall have it. A great misfortune really! Do you think
                              her so ugly?"
                           "Oh no, madam! she is very lovely. The first time I saw her, I thought
                              I should like to make her bust for nothing."
                           
                           "Do you consider that a compliment to me? But never mind!
                              You shall have her all the same."
                           No incredulity could hold out against all this, and David at last
                              allowed himself to believe that, in some incomprehensible manner, he
                              had come to be the lover of Helen. Hope and happiness need no
                              announcing; they find the doors open to receive them.
                           
                           The next summer David Dow, now David Dow Douglas, was sitting at a
                              window with his young wife, looking out upon the lawn; the same lawn
                              upon which he had lighted like a skyrocket soon after be made his
                              first appearance in this veracious history.
                           "Do you remember?" asked Helen, pointing. "It was there you were
                              presented to me. I was sitting there under my dear old oak, reading a
                              most interesting book—the 'History of the incomparable Belinda;' I
                              never read the end of it."
                           "And why, darling?"
                           "Did you ever give me time? Here it is, the unfortunate little book!
                              Shall I read you a chapter?"
                           "Thank you, my love, I would rather hear you talk. Put the little book
                              back in your pocket."
                           "Only the last sentence, dear," and a bright rosy blush mantled on her
                              soft cheek.
                           "But, of what use would that be, dear, when I don't know the
                              beginning?"
                           "You don't know what you lose by not hearing it—listen 'They were
                              married; and, in due course of time, a young prince was born as
                              beautiful as the day.'"
                           "Is it true?"
                           "THERE ARE NOTHING BUT TRUTHS IN THIS LITTLE BOOK."
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               "Ah," grumbled Mr. Growler, who had been listening with the deepest interest, "I'm
                  thankful that goose of a girl is safe at last. Who ever heard of such a
                  sentimental ninny? Here's my young friend Adelaide; there is no deuced nonsense
                  about her I'll be bound! She's my model!"
               "Dear Uncle Growler—" began Adelaide. She stopped short.
                     "Uncle." What would he think? It, came out so suddenly! She never
                  meant to say it! And there was young Appreciate with absolute rays of delight
                  beaming from his face, and looking as if he was holding himself back by the nape
                  of the neck, to keep himself from falling at her feet before all the company, and asking her to be
                  Uncle Growler's niece, in deed and truth.
               Blush after blush rose on her sweet face, and I was coming to the rescue, when
                  Mrs. Wilton, remindful of Adelaide's loving kindness to her, bravely threw herself
                  into the breach and speedily brought the enemy down upon her by declaring, "I like
                  that Helen! She was splendid! I did the same thing myself when I was a girl! and I
                  intend to write an account of a very remarkable adventure which happened to me for
                  our next evening's entertainment."
               Wonder of wonders! The millennium is surely coming, as some grave philosophers are
                  now predicting. Instead of lighting down upon her like a bomb shell, we were all
                  most agreeably surprised (not agreeably disappointed, as everybody says, which
                  seems to me, to be like "enjoying" ill health, but surprised), when
                  the clever, clumsy old gentleman gravely walked over to her, and taking her hand
                  said, "I know it will be well worth hearing. I shall enjoy your romantic
                  adventures very much."
               I really cannot decide, in consideration of this speech, whether or not I ought
                  to. have mentally ejaculated, "Sly Uncle Growler!"
               It was nearly twelve o'clock when our refreshments, mental and bodily, had been
                  discussed. And hastening home, I went immediately up to my room. To my great
                  surprise Adelaide followed me quickly, and, without removing the pretty white
                  nubia or cloud, which lay so soft on her dark hair, threw herself into my arms and
                  burst into tears.
               "My child! My darling! what is the matter?" I exclaimed.
               "Oh mamma! I—he—oh—you know!"
               "What makes you tell me I know when I know nothing? Is the old cat dead?" (I did
                  know.)
               "Oh, mamma! how can you? Mr. Appreciate told me coming home that—that he loved
                  me."
               "And you answered, that you played with dolls every day with your little sister,
                  and—"
               "No, I did not. He asked me to be his wife, and I said I would if you
                  consented."
               Ah me! here was a monster wanting to take my child from me; and she not yet
                  sixteen. A great pang shot through my heart. I felt with a new and sudden
                  intensity, that my rôle on the stage of life was
                  now to be changed; I was to pass on one side, and let the next generation take the
                  central position. With a mixture of grief and pleasure— pleasure, that my darling was only known to be
                  loved—I kissed her wet cheek, and promised to look with kindness upon her lover
                  when he came to plead his suit.
               The next morning the little wife sent for me, entreating that I would come at
                  once. I found her pale, terrified, hanging disconsolately over little Carrie's
                  crib.
               "Oh, aunt," she cried, "I am so thankful you have come; my darling slept well last
                  night; but look, what a fever she has now."
               "It is nothing but her cold, you little goose," I answered, hoping to cheer her
                  up; "only a cold, isn't it, Carrie?"
               "Yes, auntie, come and kiss me," said the child. I put my lips to her cheek. It
                  felt like a coal of fire; her pulse was hard and quick; and I advised that the
                  doctor should be sent for immediately; "not that there was any danger," I said,
                  "but as a precaution."
               The skilful family physician looked grave on his arrival, as the hoarse tones of
                  the child's voice met his ear, and commenced the most energetic treatment at once;
                  but, notwithstanding his efforts, Carrie lay all day in her little crib, tossing
                  painfully from side to side.
               In the evening she was taken up to change her clothes and bathe her feet. After
                  this had been done, her mother kissed her, and lifted her tenderly, and laid her
                  back in her bed. Looking up in surprise the child said, "Why, mamma, you
                  forgot."
               "What is it, my darling, my little precious kitten."
               "Mamma, I did not say my prayers."
               The tears started to the mother's eyes, as she replied, "I thought poor little
                  Carrie was too ill."
               "But I want to say them, dear mamma; you told me, God loved little children who
                  tried to be good, and never forgot to say their prayers."
               A reproof from a babe! Her earliest lisping word after the names of her parents,
                  had been a prayer; and now Harry, who had just entered, his little wife and I,
                  with a feeling of awe, looked on the child, as she knelt in her crib, folded her
                  tiny waxen hands, reverently closed her eyes, and in a hoarse whisper, which
                  thrilled us with a sorrowful boding, said, 
                     
                        "Now I lay me down to sleep,
                        I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
                        If I should die before I wake—"
                     
                  
               
               She opened her eyes, "Mamma—how—if I should die 'fore I wake, how could I,
                  mamma?"
               
               The little mother became deadly pale and turning to her husband, said, "Oh, Harry,
                  why does she think of this?" Then folding Carrie in her arms, as if from thence
                  not even death could take her child, she said, "Oh, my darling. The blessed Jesus,
                  if he thought it best, could carry you in his arms to Heaven while you slept,
                  there to be one of his precious little lambs forever."
               "Will the blessed Jesus come and take me to-night?" asked the child, with a
                  bright, sudden smile.
               "Oh no," almost shrieked the mother, clasping her tighter; "don't, Carrie, don't
                  talk so! God will soon make you well. Don't you want to stay with papa and mamma,
                  who love you so dearly?"
               "Why, yes," answered the dear little one, simply; and she sank down wearily on her
                  pillow, and was soon in a troubled slumber.
               I concluded to stay all night. With difficulty I persuaded Harry and his wife to
                  try to get some rest, promising to call them should Carrie seem worse. As the
                  little wife left the room I heard her murmuring to her husband, "Oh, Harry! if
                  Jesus should take our darling—!"
               The night wore on and waned. Carrie still slept under the influence of some
                  soothing medicine; and the poor little sorrowing mother and Harry were also
                  quietly sleeping in an adjoining room. I was feeling so grateful, and hoping all
                  danger was over, when a sound-sharp, frightful, like the air passing through a
                  metallic tube, came from the little one's crib. Up I sprang, my heart beating
                  violently, for well I knew what it boded. The mother was in the room the next
                  instant, ghastly and trembling.
               "Was it Carrie?" she gasped.
               What need to tell our despairing grief as we three, and soon the doctor with
                  us—laboring, but alas! helpless, to save—listened to the horrible sound of that
                  suffering little breath, coming with a hoarse shrill scream from the smothering
                  lungs and closing throat; her soft delicate features livid, almost purple, her
                  head thrown violently back, straining, struggling for air. At length the dreadful
                  cough assumed a veiled and husky tone; the wild, dilated eyes softened and looked
                  upward with a wishful gaze, as if answering some loving glance, some beckoning
                  finger which we could not see; and with the "first beam of the new-born day," our
                  darling had gently closed her eyes, and folding her tiny hands, as if again
                  murmuring her prayer, "If I should die before I wake"—lay quite dead in her little
                  crib.
               
               Our readings were over. God in his inscrutable wisdom, which we cannot always
                  fathom, but which is exact and right, had seen fit to take their child; and Harry
                  clung with new and increasing love to his sorrowing little wife, who had only him
                  on earth.
               The charmed ring of their pleasant home here was broken, and their thoughts flew
                  with yearning to His House Beautiful, in which Carrie would sit at the feet of the
                  blessed Jesus forever.
               Yes, He had taken her that sad night; but as she went she held fast in her tiny
                  hand one end of a silken thread, the other buried in the very quick of their
                  hearts: a precious silken thread, which would win and draw them, in God's own good
                  time, to Carrie and Heaven at last.
               No fear for Harry, now, little wife! God himself will complete the cure which you,
                  with His blessing, so well began.
               
               My simple, every-day story is finished: and now, of the sorrowful heart, weary
                  traveller and patient invalid, who may have gone with me to the end, I would fain
                  bespeak a kindly remembrance, while I offer to them, with my adieux, the cordial
                  sympathy and tenderness of a sister and a friend.
            
            THE END.
