            PREFACE.
            The present work purports to be a collection of newspaper stories published during
               the past year, and put into book form with but little power of revision. What,
               consequently, were the original defects of the series, that they were published by
               the Procrustean standard of length and arbitrarily made to confirm to a given space
               rather than to the necessities of the story, are still to be discovered in the
               present arrangement. If, after this statement, the reader will be good-natured enough
               to allow for the hasty composition incident to daily journals—for the fact that such
               stories form but the smaller portion of a newspaper laborer's contributions, whether
               regarded as to quantity or to length—some indulgence will be perhaps made for its
               most marked deficiencies.

               AN OLD FAMILY HISTORY.
               [It has not been long since the public of this city were agitated about the arrest
                  of a lady, supposed to be of position and fashion, and that this incarceration
                  formed for several days the principal and almost the only topic of conversation.
                  The fact that it had occurred in one of the most public restaurants of the city
                  added to the interest. By the journals at the time it was variously spoken of as
                  an outrage of the police on one side, and as a violation of received usage on the
                  other, though without, as it now appears, either side knowing much about the
                  matter. Whispers were heard of enormous bribes offered to prevent incarceration or
                  the knowledge of the fact becoming known of the delirium of passion with which the
                  event was attended when finally the incarceration was made—and of the suppression
                  of names even by mutilating the records. As a curious history in this and
                  preceding particulars, now that the veil of secrecy is no longer needed, and as a
                  justification of the character of the Recorder at the time attacked; lastly, to
                  banish from conversation the absurd statements of the gossips and
                  sensation-seekers who affected to knew most about the matter, the following facts
                  have been arranged in what may be called a rounded story. They were originally
                  indorsed, as given below, for the purpose of serving as a prologue or introductory
                  chapter to a fictional work prepared about this city, (never published,) and for a
                  certain coldness of tone and absence of warmth of coloring, this must be its
                  excuse. The absence too, of details, which gives, in places, baldness to the
                  account, and makes it appear too crowded, must also be explained by the time
                  covered by the narrative. A few obvious discrepancies and almost bodily excerpts
                  from publications made years ago, will, in a story of this sort, need no
                  excuse.]
               It is in our own 
                     meridonal
                     meridional
                   city of the Great River and Gulf Coast that this story opens—in one of
                  its oldest faubourgs. It is in a portion that was once prosperous, but which is
                  now either depopulated or abandoned to its former servile population. Its glory
                  has departed and its business has fled to other quarters. The cobble stones have
                  become worn and uneven—the grass grows thickly between, and houses with placards
                  dangling from the balconies and inscribed with chambre a
                     louer—show by what class they are occurred and the scarcity of
                  tenants. The population now is generally disreputable. Its history is made up in
                  Coroner's inquests and police court reports.
               Still you cannot help feeling interested in the suburb with its air of faded
                  gentility, its hints of past wealth and prosperity. The old houses leave
                  impressions that you are unable to shake off.
               If, for instance, you have ever rode or promenaded through Desoto street, you must
                  have particularly been struck with the old Charlorais house. But half inhabited
                  and thoroughly dilapidated, it tells plainly, without any questioning, that the
                  fortunes of the founder have either been scattered, or what is more likely, that
                  the original possessors have disappeared and become forgotten altogether. The
                  observer would pronounce it the embodiment of all sombre-looking and faded old
                  family residences.
               The frequent arches by which the outer walls of the building are perforated, tell
                  of its age and of its Spanish architecture; but these have become mildewed and
                  mouldering, and a high lattice fence still surrounding it appears as if
                  endeavoring to screen it from observation. A thick growth, too, of orange, banana
                  and other evergreen trees, and which almost embower it in the dark green shade,
                  adds to this impression.
               The very atmosphere about the place is melancholy. You readily guess that its
                  walls never echo to the tread of revelry or pleasanter music, the rustle of a
                  woman's dress. The household gods have in fact vanished—the private residence has
                  degenerated into a disreputable restaurant, and a lurid lamp, with the inscription
                  of "Entrance to Families," warns every happily married couple to escape from the
                  neighborhood as speedily as possible.
               What causes the house to be remembered is that it was once the residence of a
                  family of some note, but which, like many others of that day, are now almost
                  forgotten. It has suffered the fortunes of the street and quarter, after standing
                  as the synonym of the fashions and follies, the virtues and crimes of several
                  generations. The name has disappeared except in connection with some similar old
                  building or street, and is scarcely mentioned except in answer by old citizens to
                  inquiries from the curious.
               Its present obscurity is difficult to be realized; after hearing of what was its
                  importance so short a time ago.
               Once having controlled wealth, one wonders what ill-omened qualities led the
                  possessor to lose it, or why the influence that wealth ordinarily commands in
                  times of prosperity in making friend did not prevent a name from passing
                  altogether out of memory. But families decay as often through their generous
                  qualities as they do through their vices. The open-hearted possessor of wealth who
                  stands forward as the redresser of wrong, and whose means are ever at the command
                  of his friends, is in constant danger of parting with means and friends
                  altogether. 
               To some extent mistakes of this sort may have affected their worldly prosperity.
                  But with their nobler qualities were mixed vices of a positive nature—sufficient
                  in themselves to have brought on ruin. The
                  wealthy descendant degenerated from the energetic ancestor. Estates that were
                  inherited, and which were so valuable that it is difficult to understand by what
                  course of folly they could have been squandered—passed from their hands never to
                  return. For a time it was sustained by its past, social position by appointment to
                  offices obtained through friends. Once by the great beauty and accomplishments of
                  its female members it was enabled by fortunate marriages to regain some of its
                  wealth. But it remained only momentarily, and with its final disappearance, the
                  name seemed to go down and die out all at once. This was accounted for by several
                  dark actions which sullied its records. A beautiful girl connected with the
                  family, it was whispered, had had a history similar to that of Beatrice Cenci. One
                  of the name had been tried for murder, and had exhausted his means in establishing
                  his innocence. Another had become the jest of the town from his philosophical
                  ideas upon the subject of marriage: and lastly, the head of the family had failed,
                  and had lost what money had thus far remained.
               M'lle Isaure Charlorais was the last of the name who occupied much of the
                  attention of the world. Her history commenced when the family greatness was at its
                  zenith. She was born with wealth and position, and her beauty is spoken of as of
                  that remarkable kind that it amounted to fascination. What with her 
                     posisive
                     positive
                   attractions and her reputation for others, she certainly was not lacking
                  in admirers. Race horses, bar-rooms and steamboats were named after her, and
                  apropos of the latter, the answer she once gave a too curious admirer will serve
                  to show her power. "Why is that tug boat called by my name?" said she. "It is
                  because I have so many flats in tow." Her explanation was founded in truth, if all
                  the statements about her are to be believed. She is said to have had several
                  hundred offers of marriage, and two or three elderly citizens, with gray hair
                  streaming behind like King Lear's, still tell of her charms. In short, almost from
                  the baptismal font, with Gen. Jackson acting as godfather, to the marriage altar,
                  her path was strewn with flowers.
               In spite of the positive advantages by which she was surrounded, the omens for her
                  future happiness were not altogether auspicious. Mlle. Isaure was regarded as wild
                  and inconsequente. None but an acknowledged
                  belle could have committed so many indiscretions, or have escaped their
                  consequences so easily.
               Another of the anecdotes told of her is that once she had invited a gay party to
                  accompany her upon a steamboat she held in her own right. During the excursion she
                  took possession of the bar-room, and then demanded the patronage of her friends.
                  She ceased not to play the role of Hebe until the heads of all her guests were
                  affected and the contents of the bottles exhausted. The instance thus given was a
                  fair sample of her follies, though they did not generally violate the prejudices
                  of her sex. Still her fascination almost invariably ruined every young man that
                  came within the sphere of her influence: and it was to her that Louis Phillippe
                  addressed his compliment upon the charms of herself and city sisterhood.
               Among her innumerable suitors, the most prominent were two gentlemen well known at
                  that time as St. Evremond and Depinay. No better example could be given of her
                  reckless disregard of consequence, than the manner in which she finally awarded
                  her preference between 
                      hem
                     them
                  .
               They both belonged to the fast set of the day, and equally occupied themselves
                  with the bizarre follies common enough with men who have no serious occupation,
                  and which seemed committed only to bewilder everyone as to their true character.
                  The predominating trait with both was that they were equally quick to give and
                  take offence—Depinay from a passionate, resentful disposition, St. Evremond from
                  amusement—from a lack of serious employment.
               St. Evremond had in this the advantage of his rival that he was the equal of
                  Isaure in point of fortune. He was the heir of a family which had become possessed
                  of large grants of land, and which had been the first to adopt Etienne Brie's
                  sugar-raising experiments in 1796. The dream which had rained all 
                     who who
                     who
                   had previously attempted it had brought in the present case an enormous
                  fortune; that is to say, that in a parish which produced 50,000 hogsheads of
                  sugar, the St. Evremond family had raised 5000 hogsheads upon their own estates
                  alone.
               This estate, large as it was, St. Evremond had already distinguished himself for
                  his ingenious ways of dissipating. But in spite of his generous, or rather
                  reckless, display of wealth, Adolphe Depinay was thought to be the more favored
                  suitor. He was, in the first place, thoroughly infatuated with the lady in
                  question, and in spite, or perhaps on account of his uncertain temperament and
                  violent humors—sometimes generous, sometimes revengeful—would probably have won
                  with any degree of prudence. But this latter quality he was never known upon any
                  occasion to have shown; and an opportunity at length occurred when the lack of it
                  redounded fatally to his claims and to the credit of his rival.
               The two had been upon a debauch together at a watering place across the lake,
                  where, in company with Isaure and many other residents of the city, they had been
                  spending the summer. Among other excesses which St. Evremond affected, he
                  sometimes destroyed on such occasions with a singular deliberation every frail
                  article that came within his reach. For instance, he would enter a
                  coffee-house—his favorite point of attack—and break ever glass decanter and bottle
                  that he could lay his hands upon. It would endanger the life of the barkeeper to
                  make any resistance, but the bill for damages would be subsequently paid without
                  question.
               Upon the present occasion he had carried Depinay to a house owned by himself, but
                  which he neglected, to stay at the hotel. By way of amusing himself and friend, he
                  commenced an attack upon his furniture, plate, etc., and invited his friend to do
                  the same. Depinay himself was in a savage mood, and did not wait for a second
                  offer. By way of showing that the favor was appreciated, he seized a decanter, and
                  while his host was amusing himself with the smaller articles, he hurled it at a
                  large pier glass which adorned the parlor. The destruction of his most valuable
                  piece of furniture at the outset by his friend, and his own comparatively harmless
                  efforts meanwhile, disgusted St. Evremond with this species of madness, when no
                  word of counsel would. He proposed play, as equally ruinous and in better
                  taste.
               Depinay assented and the two sat down to cards. But the game in the mood in which
                  they were in, did not greatly interest. Finally St. Evremond declared that he had
                  hit upon an idea.
               "I have grown wearied," ha said, "of this place. I still do not chose to abandon
                  my chances of winning the prize for which we have both been struggling."
               "What is it you wish to say?" inquired Depinay.
               "Your chance of gaining the hand of Mlle. Isaure is as good as mine. But she is
                  perfectly contented to have us both harnessed to her triumphal car, and she, if
                  let alone, will keep us so forever."
               "True," said Depinay, "She shows but little alacrity in hastening my—that is to
                  say, the happiness of either one of us."
               "What I propose, then," said his companion, "is that we decide before we leave the
                  table which of us shall abandon the field. We have already staked everything else.
                  My hopes of winning against yours. Come!"
               "The proposition is not a fair one. My chances are more than double yours."
               "You are mistaken about the facts; but rather than remain longer in doubt, I will
                  give you that much odds. The wager will at least lead to something."
               Depinay consented. The cards were dealt. It was his fortune to win. His adversary
                  threw down his cards without any emotion.
               "I accept the result philosophically," said St. Evremond, "and shall not wait to
                  have my trunks packed. I leave you to make my adieux. You will not neglect to
                  invite me to the wedding."
               Depinay was too happy to escape, and hurried into the presence of Isaure. At
                  learning of the approaching departure she soon guessed at the truth. It was
                  obvious she was about losing one of her wealthiest and most devoted admirers. She
                  liked Depinay the better of the two but her heart had never absolutely decided in
                  his favor, and at hearing of his rival's departure, it turned strongly against
                  him. Added to this her vanity was piqued that her hand should have been disposed
                  of without her consent.
               Actuated by these feelings she hastened from the drawing-room to the general
                  reception room of the hotel, and was not disappointed in finding him there. In the
                  presence of a large number of guests, who had thought they were to witness his
                  departure, she threw her arms around his neck and begged him not to leave her—that
                  she had loved him always, and him only.
               He remained.
               The wedding was arranged to speedily take place, and Depinay cursed and execrated
                  without changing the result. He maintained that his only fault was his generosity,
                  and that his rival had given him odds and lost purposely in order to produce a
                  dramatic situation. He thought the matter worth fighting a duel about, and his
                  star was again malignant. Had he have been wounded, he now argued, all of Isaure's
                  sympathy would have been in his favor. Unfortunately he inflicted a slight wound
                  upon his adversary, though sufficiently severe to cause her to abide by her
                  resolution. It did not prevent her, however, from hesitating.
               A dozen times during the day preceding the wedding did she alter her mind and her
                  purpose almost fail, At the ceremony appeared Depinay himself, who had with
                  difficulty been kept from suicide, and whose wild, haggard appearance caused all
                  of her slumbering sentiment in his favor to reawaken. She consented to appear upon
                  the floor in one of the first waltzes, after the ceremony was performed, and St.
                  Evremond in vain crossed the room and reminded her that she was married—that
                  henceforth he would arrogate to himself the exclusive right to her hand. But the
                  remonstrance was unheeded, and the assembled guests were scandalized by seeing a
                  quarrel upon the wedding night between the husband and his former rival suitor. It
                  required another duel to adjust the matter, and this time it was the fortune of
                  Depinay to receive a severe wound.
               After such a commencement it need hardly be said that the union was not a happy
                  one. Perhaps any contract that Isaure might have entered into would have appeared
                  ill-assorted. She had been educated to shine in company and the task of amusing
                  any one admirer, she soon discovered, was the one she was least fitted to perform.
                  Still, with Depinay at that time, her life would have had many moral guarantees of
                  happiness.
               As for St. Evremond, he was not long either in arriving at the conclusion that his
                  heart had not been much more affected. Anticipating the caprices of a spoiled
                  woman was a task which he entered into with but little spirit. He was not
                  naturally of a jealous disposition, but the truth was that without sometimes
                  quarreling, he had nothing else to do, and his wife furnished him more than one
                  pretext for indulging in what was perhaps the most agreeable pastime of his
                  life.
               Otherwise his business was to do nothing gracefully, and to spend the income of a
                  large estate, and finally the estate itself, in as useless a manner as possible. A
                  present of a magnificent resident would occasionally attest his generosity, where
                  some thought a bouquet would have shown too much admiration, and the loss of lands
                  enough to constitute a principality would sometimes be the result of a single
                  night's amusements. Still he lived gaily, and was not of the class who grow
                  old.
               He was already passing the prime of his life at the time of his marriage, but with
                  his courtly air and lively manners, it was hardly suspected. Indeed had he lived
                  to the patriarchal term, he would have made some protest against wrinkles and old
                  age. His philosophy was to distil pleasure from every source, to shrug his
                  shoulders at the ills of life, and to trouble himself very little about the effect
                  of his losses upon his own life, or the lives of those who might 
                     come come
                     come
                   after him.
               Meanwhile there was nothing that was known to be criminal in any of Isaure's
                  relations. 
                     still
                     Still
                   her conduct undoubtedly inspired distrust. At almost every public place
                  Adolphe Depinay was her attendant, or other cavaliers, whose whiskers or violent
                  style of dressing induced suspicion; whose arm rested with too much ease upon the
                  back of her chair, or whose air and attitude were too assured for mere platonic
                  friendship. There was about her an atmosphere—a malaria, which could not be
                  defined, but which was none the less felt—which none the less awakened doubts. A
                  restless fever glittered in her eyes, and in her whole person there was an evident
                  discontent with the sober realities of life. In course of time her name came to be
                  mentioned in connection with that of Depinay, with the usual shrugging of
                  shoulders and wagging of tongues in subdued whispers; and, lastly not mentioned at
                  all. Her carriage was no longer seen standing at other people's doors, and her
                  name disappeared from invitation lists and card baskets.
               This last state of affairs was not accomplished without a struggle—the struggle of
                  a captivating woman to retain her admirers and her social position. With a little
                  less frivolity of character, the contest might have gone in her favor. She was
                  still admired for her beauty, and to every one, but her husband, was still
                  fascinating. She dressed with taste. No certain scandal was ever laid at her door.
                  Her husband, too, though little careful about preserving her innocence, was always
                  ready to embark in its defence. Lastly, she was not altogether deserving of
                  censure and her indiscretions arose sometimes from the generous traits of her
                  character. It is always a difficult matter at any time to expel a charming woman
                  from society, and so, for a long time, she had been attacked only in timid
                  whispers.
               Still it is not permitted even to the fairest always to triumph. She was made
                  definitely to realize her altered position
                  upon the occasion of a ball which was given at the old Opera House, and which was
                  designed to be the grandest and most exclusive affair ever up to that period given
                  in the city.
               To obtain the entree to this became a question of standing. Applications for
                  tickets were passed upon by a committee of half dozen censors; and, as a question
                  of character was the only reason that could be assigned, a refusal would be
                  regarded as a serious misfortune.
               Under these circumstances the name of Isaure was presented. Although Depinay was
                  one of the committee the name was rejected. The utmost efforts of her friends,
                  assisted by Depinay, failed in producing any other result.
               The blow was a severe one to her, but as was her wisest course, she endeavored to
                  keep the knowledge of her application concealed, more especially from her husband.
                  Unfortunately, it became the gossip of the town; and it was not long in reaching
                  the ears that Isaure most dreaded should receive it. She understood the character
                  of St. Evremond too thoroughly to have much hope of affecting his resolution.
               Nevertheless, when she saw him making preparations for a hostile meeting, she knew
                  too well that its consequences would affect her position unfavorably, not to make
                  at least a faint effort to prevent it.
               "You are bent upon exposing me to comment? Whom have you challenged?" she
                  impetuously asked.
               "What matters it," he answered, "so some one is held responsible. I drew by lot
                  from the names on the committee."
               "And with what result?"
               "Our old friend Depinay will be my man."
               "You will not fight him. He did everything to assist me that he could."
               "You do not know that—that is, the public are not supposed to know it. It would
                  not much matter if they did. Besides, I prefer to fight him to any one else, and
                  it has been a long time since we saluted each other at ten paces."
               "You are an old man now, mon ami—your head is
                  gray. Select some other folly to amuse yourself with at your time of life. I am
                  more concerned than you. I no longer care for the world; and even if I did, the
                  remedy you propose will prove the surest means of forever banishing me from it.
                  Will you not for once give way to me, and let this matter drop?"
               St. Evremond was carefully examining a box of dueling pistols which had already
                  had a history of their own, and which he probably valued as much as any of his
                  possessions. Occupied in this care, and thinking of the scenes which the case
                  suggested, he hardly heard, and at any rate made no answer to the appeal of his
                  wife.
               "But select," continued the latter undiscouraged, "some other name from the list
                  of the committee. It you will fight as you pretend, upon my account, do not try to
                  kill the only man who in the matter proved himself my friend."
               St. Evremond laughed gaily, and promised her an answer at their next meeting.
               From her presence he proceeded immediately to a well known duelling ground, where
                  he found that Depinay already awaited him.
               The two men had taken their places, and with unfastened sleeves and exposed
                  breasts, stood regarding each other while awaiting the word of their second.
                  Depinay held a cigar between his teeth, but his air was thoughtful. At length he
                  said:
               "I regret, St. Evremond, to have to shoot at you any more. We have fought and
                  shown ourselves fools often enough to prevent any one from doubting our courage.
                  Withdraw your challenge. For once in our lives we can show ourselves sensible.
                  Will you not imitate me?"
               Depinay threw away his pistol, and stood with folded arms.
               "What you say, Depinay, may be true enough," said St, Evremond, with his usual
                  shrug, "but your suggestion comes rather too late. It is much more sensible that
                  we shoot at each other than to have to make long explanations hereafter. I should
                  fire at my grandfather and try to kill him too, once he was placed ten paces
                  distant. Take again your pistol, and let us get through with this."
               "You may be right, but something tells me I shall kill you when we fire. As you
                  say, if we are to fight, there is no need making it a farce. Give the word," said
                  he to one of the seconds, throwing away at the same time his cigar and retaking
                  his pistol.
               The word was given—the weapons were discharged at the same moment, and a wound
                  that St. Evremond received told that Depinay's anticipations would probably be
                  realized.
               His antagonist, although the wound was near the heart, did not immediately die—he
                  was carried home upon a litter; but it was evident to every one but himself that
                  his days were numbered. Indeed, as for St. Evremond, he refused to give any
                  indications of pain, and apparently his mind was as gay, as frivolous, and as much
                  occupied with trifles as ever.
               A young brother, who had been already forewarned that he would never recover, came
                  to visit him. The brother's face naturally had assumed the serious expression
                  which one wears when standing in the presence of death.
               "Do you wish to see the priest?"
               "Ah bah!" was the response. "Come none of that with me, vieux criminel. Anything but that tone. You are younger than I, but
                  I promise to outlive you yet. Tell me about the town, the femmes gallantes about anything but dying."
               "Permit me to speak of something else besides youthful follies. I will not
                  disguise from you that your end is approaching."
               "I shall not accept your judgment as the correct one. You were always wrong—you
                  were never correct about anything in your life. If I die, it will be of a broken
                  heart that I did not give Depinay the bullet wound he has bestowed upon me."
               "And yet, he bore you no malice, and wished to avoid the difficulty."
               "I don't know that I bear him a great deal on the contrary, I wish you would bring
                  him to see me, instead of wearying me with your sermons. In spite of our quarrel,
                  he always understood me better than any one else."
               "What would you say to him if he were present?"
               "I would not attempt anything with Depinay that was not obviously absurd. I would
                  try to persuade him, therefore, to marry my wife when I am out of the way, as you
                  insist I soon shall be."
               "That would indeed sound like a singular request."
               "It would be the only revenge I could take upon him. He has always fancied he was
                  in love with her and that his life has been made miserable because his wish was
                  denied him. I think it would be amusing to see how these disappointed lovers would
                  act when all of the obstacles that stand in their path are removed. You must bring
                  them in my presence and let me pronounce upon them my blessing in advance."
               "Now that you have resigned yourself to the approach of death, would it not be
                  better to settle your worldly accounts. Once again, will you allow me to send for
                  a priest?"
               "By no means. You shall not come here, you young blackguard, to remind me of my
                  follies. After living so long I shall not require any advice about dying. I have
                  always acted like a gentleman. My balance sheet are as clean as some of those who
                  do not think it." And he commenced singing a well known chant with much affected 
                     fevor
                     fervor
                  .
               Still when the crowd had departed and the old man was momentarily left alone with
                  his child, he revealed to the latter, who could scarcely understand it, more
                  emotion then he had thus far betrayed to his friends.
               "It is a rather poor sort of world this even when you have had almost everything
                  your own way," he went on to say, talking as much to himself as any one. "We
                  should never have quarreled or fought if Depinay and I had not at one time been
                  such good friends. It is always so. It is our friends who in the end become our
                  worst enemies."
               Depinay was prevailed upon to visit him, and to him, almost with his last breath,
                  he repeated his request; and, not only this, he furthermore asked that Depinay
                  should act as him executor in case he could find any estate upon which to
                  administer.
               After his death it was discovered that he had long before secretly deposited a
                  valuable diamond ring—an heir-loom of his family—in the hands of a well known
                  undertaker, with instructions to pay with it the expenses of his funeral.
                  Obviously he had become possessed with the idea, which, indeed, his extravagant
                  course sufficiently warranted, that there was a probability of his being buried
                  like a beggar unless he should in some way provide in advance for his funeral.
               But the most singular circumstance about the whole matter, and which sounded too
                  absurd to be believed, was it not remembered that the eccentricities of daily life
                  exceed those of romance—the most singular part of this family history, was that
                  the union between Isaure and Adolphe Depinay—which had been dreamed of when both
                  parties were young, full of hope and generous sentiments—which had been arranged
                  by St. Evremond upon his death-bed—was actually, a short time after his death,
                  consummated.
               It is true, Depinay had once been so madly in love that he would have sacrificed
                  his own life in despair had he not been restrained by the remonstrances of his
                  friends. But the world only laughed at his final union, and said that he had never
                  had any definite purpose or conviction in life—that he did not know what he
                  wanted—that the match was one of Isaure's bizarre follies, and that what appeared
                  a little like romance was only an absurd indiscretion which she was now too old a
                  woman to commit.
               The judgment of time tended to confirm these conclusions. The second union was as
                  little productive of happiness as the first.
               Isaure still had at the death of her first husband a considerable estate, which
                  she held in her own name and nominally under her own control. But it one day
                  appeared that she had been induced to make sales of what property she possessed at
                  almost nominal prices. Through an agent Depinay had become the purchaser, and had
                  then, unknown to her, resold it for its full value.
               The evening preceding the discovery of this treachery, Depinay had appeared in
                  public with his wife, and those who then saw them together remembered the time
                  when they first were lovers. Depinay never appeared so fond; no one could have
                  understood what precise motive led him to perform so despicable a part. Some said
                  that it was suspicion, some a natural want of principle—that in spite of what
                  appeared a trait of generosity in his last duel, he was revengeful by nature; that
                  he had never forgiven either Isaure or St. Evremond for their marriage, and that
                  his union had proceeded partly from avarice, partly from a desire to finally
                  triumph; that he doubted her purity at the time of his marriage, and that some
                  circumstance, which, to his suspicious mind, amounted to a proof of guilt, had
                  goaded him to the commission of what was worse than a crime.
               Be this as it may, the last time they were ever seen together in public was in a
                  dashing equipage upon the shellroad, both of them abandoning themselves to their
                  humors, and apparently happy. They continued their route to the hotel at the
                  fashionable resorting place for suburban suppers. The usual meal followed, of
                  costly dishes and rare wines, which still attends such excursions, and under its
                  influence Isaure began to dream that the happiness of her life was about to
                  recommence. Toward the close of the repast the conversation had become more
                  tender, and it was remembered by at least one of the parties.
               "I do not ask you to love me, Adolphe, if you will only promise to be moderately
                  good natured."
               Adolphe kissed her arm and pinched her ear by way of reply.
               "I know I am no longer in the first bloom of youth, and you men of the world—it is
                  you who are capricious and difficult to please—I know that you never care for us
                  after we fade."
               "Your skin is like alabaster, Isaure; you were never prettier than in the full
                  maturity of your charms."
               Isaure remarked that he had only complimented her for her beauty, and it caused
                  her to ask immediately what would otherwise have exacted from her a longer delay
                  and more caution.
               "Tell me, why it is that knowing me as well as you have done, you are so often
                  jealous? You must remember that, in spite of the sentiment I could not keep from
                  entertaining for you during my former marriage, in spite of my natural
                  indiscretion and impudence, I never gave the world any real cause for speaking ill
                  of me. And you knew, too, that had I not truly loved you, I would not, situated as
                  I was, have married you, or indeed any one; and, yet, you will be jealous of
                  me!"
               Depinay slightly trembled, and his face became pale at this speech; but it did not
                  appear whether it was from anger or remorse. He concealed his emotion by kissing
                  her neck.
               "No, you need not compliment me—I am getting old. I am growing weary with city
                  life. You never have any real friend here, and I sigh for the country. I have
                  never lived there very long; but I think I could there find some happiness. It may
                  be perhaps because I know nothing of it, and because I have never found any
                  here."
               "Let us finish our wine," said Adolphe.
               "But you have made me no answer; be amiable enough to drink to me some good
                  natured sentiment."
               "In that case—Our happiness in the future. We will go through life
                  like a couple of lovers as we are, and live in the country with a shepherd's crook
                  in our hands if you wish."
               Here he emptied his glass, and rose as if to go out and pay the bill.
               "And you will not be jealous any more, Adolphe?"
               "No, I shall never weary you anymore with my jealousy. Have a gay time with whom
                  you please. I give you a carte blanche."
               He stooped and kissed her upon the face. It was the last time. At the door he
                  lingered a moment and repeated his words. He went out and did not return.
               At the end of fifteen minutes Isaure recalled the tone in which his last words had
                  been spoken. A superstitious feeling and a vague terror made her immediately
                  summon the restaurateur. His answers to her
                  eager questions were polite and formal;
                  but the news his words conveyed to her ear were so dreadful they sounded like
                  brutality.
               She had been left alone after being, as she now saw, ruined and plundered. She had
                  not only been abandoned and betrayed, but deserted in the most public manner;
                  deserted too by a man who had sworn to love and protect her; deserted at the
                  moment she most fancied, that she was loved. She had been treated as a lorette who
                  becomes wearisome. Shellroaded—the word that described their
                  miserable fate was now the term applicable to her.
               Surrounded by a crowd in whose presence every expression of grief is mute, every
                  utterance of despair restrained, Isaure scarcely gave any expression to her
                  feeling. Indeed her calamity was so overwhelming, so obviously irredeemable in its
                  consequences that it admitted of no palliation.
               "It is the friend we love that betrays," she said in an agitated voice a little
                  above a whisper. The phrase, in a voice a little above a whisper, was many times
                  repeated, as if her lips were incapable of forming any other words. It was
                  afterwards remembered that almost the same words had escaped the lips of St.
                  Evremond.
               The restaurateur was meanwhile watching her wild
                  and frenzied look of despair with increasing consternation. The locking of her
                  hands in an emotion which was incapable otherwise of expression, the rigid
                  attitude and half hysterical laughter, seemed to him the effects of wine or of
                  absolute insanity. In either case his duty and interest were plain.
               Poor Isaure was consigned to the care of a policeman.
               The rest of the story is soon told. The Coroner was called in at one of the
                  lock-up's for vagrants and criminals to hold an inquest upon a somewhat singular
                  case. A rigid and pallid corpse lay extended in one of the cells. The keepers
                  appeared a little perplexed about the matter; for the party who had just died had
                  excited by her mariner a certain respect. Still the jewelry that was found on the
                  body and the elaborate toilette, left no doubt about the matter—a prostitute of
                  the better class of course, died suddenly in prison. That was all. A statement to
                  this effect is the verdict and a burial—before friends are informed of the matter
                  in an unpainted coffin—the result. Poor Isaure!
            
            
               A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE.
               A 
                     REMINISCENSE
                     REMINISCENCE
                   OF THE LATE WAR.
               Why certain scenes and impressions in no way unusual, and in themselves
                  common-place, should settle readily in the mind, and afterwards have power to
                  haunt the memory, is not always easy to understand. Doubtless it is because the
                  faculties are in a more than ordinary observant mood; possibly it is somewhat the
                  same frame of mind as that which leads us, when superstitiously inclined, to have
                  what is known as presentiments; to take up whims which are unsupported by reason,
                  and to trust to them as if they were logical conclusions.
               That something unusual should then really justify the presentiment is but to say
                  that our actions are affected by abnormal trains of thought. The awakening within
                  us of a deeper and more prophetic perception of the truth must explain the fact
                  that such presentiments sometimes come true—if the matter will admit of any
                  explanation whatever.
               For this somewhat musty statement of truth, the following account of several
                  extraordinary circumstances must serve as an excuse.
               
                  
                  At the time of which I have to speak, I was following the fortunes of the
                     Virginia army, and making in close company with two comrades the last of the
                     terrible marches which preceded the surrender. The army had been overtaken by a
                     snow storm. The roads were quagmires, into which the horses and men descended
                     to their knees. Tents and commissary wagons had been stalled far in the rear.
                     The regiments struggled heavily along, one blended mass of wet and hungry
                     soldiers. With no food, with a pitiless heaven overhead, and a wet around
                     underneath, to shift for themselves. was, with almost every soldier, as was
                     conceded by the strictest officers, a matter of absolute necessity.
                  It was the incidents of this particular day's march (for such marches were
                     common enough) that fastened themselves at the time upon my attention, and
                     awakened the particular feeling to which I have alluded. For instance, while
                     late in the afternoon looking down from a hill of some elevation, and seeing
                     the army pass, toiling forward by regiments and brigades through the red mud,
                     the idea was distinctly formed in my mind, without any apparent reason, that
                     some unusual event was about to happen in my history, and that I would, by
                     something soon to occur, be transported to an altogether different world of
                     thought and feeling. Why such a presentiment should have arisen at the moment
                     from a circumstance which admitted of no such a logical inference, I have never
                     been able to understand.
                  My friends I shall briefly introduce by the names of Camille and Wandorf. The
                     former was the humorous man of our party. Wandorf had no conception of a joke
                     whatever.
                  The great point with us at the time was where to find some comfortable place to
                     sleep. The matter was one full of difficulty. The army was scattered in every
                     direction. Every place of shelter was already occupied.
                  Toward the close of this murky afternoon, when the whole party was worn down
                     with fatigue, we passed in front of one of those large comfortable-looking
                     mansions which had once in Virginia bespoken the abode of wealth and plenty. It
                     appeared to us doubly comfortable after our recent marches.
                  The house in fact looked so inviting that each one regarded it long and
                     wistfully. Camille point blank refused to go any further. It was absolutely
                     necessary, he maintained, that we should here obtain quarters.
                  But the matter upon examination did not appear so easy. There were abundant
                     evidences that every coign of vantage had already been taken. Soldiers were
                     streaming in and streaming out from every place of shelter. Some had modestly
                     contented themselves with the shuckpens and haylofts; others had quartered
                     themselves in the negro cabins, and stood drying their dripping clothing and
                     blankets by the fire. Camille explored toward the mansion house itself, but his
                     face was not cheerful as he rejoined us.
                  "It's a bad showing here," he remarked, with a dismal glance upward at the
                     still weeping heavens. "There's a crowd out of doors who appear to have designs
                     upon the dining-room, and looking through the windows you will remark that the
                     parties already in possession of the knives, and forks display a rude skill in
                     using them—a bad augury for those who come after. Obviously there's no chance
                     for supper. We had better play for one of these stable lofts. Let us take up
                     our quarters there for the night at once."
                  "Unfortunately," said Wandorf, "the experiment has been tried already. The loft
                     is already filled with soldiers, and the one who guards the entrance threatens
                     to shoot any man that attempts to come up."
                  "There was no mistaking that hint," said Camille, musingly. "I've tried the
                     kitchen, and the cooks and servantmaids, for once, are not to be flattered.
                     They refuse to be prepossessed. We are regularly in for it to-night."
                  The rain was now descending; with a dull patter upon the roof of one of the
                     outhouses under whose eaves we were standing for shelter. Meanwhile the main
                     building gained in appearance, and we regarded it more and more wistfully. The
                     scene in the dining-room irritated the fancy of Camille, who was always hungry,
                     and now more than ever, and started him to giving us a very animated
                     description of a tropical feast to
                     which he had once sat down to in Havana. His minute and exaggerated description
                     of the various fruits and tropical dainties became tormenting. We were so
                     hungry that we had to beg him to stop.
                  "It wont do to stay here remaining idle, rain or no rain," said he. "Something
                     must be done—we have tried every other way—we must attack the enemy in their
                     parlor strongholds."
                  "You are right," I told him. "You are sure to succeed. I have had a
                     presentiment all the afternoon that we were to sleep in just such a house."
                  Camille was the Figaro of the party. He now set to work, without waiting for
                     encouragement, to arrange his costume in the most telling manner the nature of
                     the case would admit. He brought out a white collar and cravat which were
                     reserved for extraordinary occasions, and leaving the rest of us to shift for
                     ourselves, boldly approached the door. We saw him speak to one of the inmates
                     of the house—we saw him make his best bow, and then
                     disappear.
                  
                     When the fancy of Wandorf became excited
                        with a momentary ray of hope, with Camille's description
                     of his feast, and by seeing the windows of the house lighted up from within and
                     gloaming with a warm ruddy glow. Once or twice too the figures of the inmates,
                     elegantly attired in evening costume, were seen to momentarily appear. He
                     heaved a sigh of regret.
                  "Are you taking the situation, aux serieux,
                     or are you amusing yourself with busy images of the past? You may be dull until
                     Camille returns, if you have anything to say."
                  "The fact is," he said, "that this dog's life brought to mind a pretty party
                     whom I once knew, and for whose arms I sometimes sigh."
                  "Courage, then; you will soon see her. The lady in question is one of those
                     figures whom we now occasionally see flitting behind the panes. Soldiers never
                     think of anything but the opposite sex in camp—even those who at home never
                     dream of going near them. In fact, I am sufficiently affected to get married
                     myself should a leave of absence ever afford me an opportunity."
                  "But why did you say that the lady who appeared just now at the window was the
                     one of whom I was thinking?"
                  "A presentiment tells me you will soon stand face to face, and presentiments,
                     you know, always come true."
                  "She is not there," he said, though his fancy was struck with the
                     suggestion.
                  "Let us at any rate indulge in rosy ideas until Camille appears. Now for the
                     story of your charmer."
                  "You absolutely insist—"
                  "Undoubtedly."
               
               
                  IDALIE.
                  "Fancy, then, if you are in the mood to listen, a very pretty woman, in a small
                     village, who had more wit and education than most of those by whom she was
                     surrounded; in fact, one of the few fascinating women whom one meets in a
                     lifetime."
                  "But that is imagining a good deal."
                  "It was, nevertheless, true. I was young and inexperienced—I was infatuated at
                     first sight. I obtained an introduction to her guardian. When I pressed him, he
                     vaguely promised me, when occasion presented, to introduce me. Her name, I
                     should tell you, was Idalie."
                  "You of course called upon the paternal party and reminded him of his
                     agreement?"
                  "Precisely. Fancy how my ardor was dampened when he coolly informed me that the
                     lady declined receiving any introduction."
                  "What did you do?"
                  "I was angrily threatening at the door to hold him to account, when the lady
                     herself appeared. She sustained the statement already made, but consented to
                     listen to what I would say, if I would in the first place apologize for my
                     rudeness to her guardian."
                  "This you of course did. But the commencement of your conversation must have
                     been a little embarrassing."
                  "Indeed it was not. Entering the parlor I never spoke more at my ease, for I
                     said what I felt. I made an explanation which was absurd enough, but which was
                     perhaps as effective as any. I told her that there was something in her face
                     that convinced me we were destined to be friends. Twice already I had seen the
                     same expression and cast of features—in each case I had been strongly attracted
                     and not to my sorrow. Would she but grant me an opportunity—would she but
                     banish the prejudices that I had through my awkwardness awakened, I ventured to
                     hope she would find the same sympathy for me that I had already felt in advance
                     for her."
                  "If any one else were to introduce themselves to a lady with such a speech it
                     might excite some wonder at their assurance. It must have been sincerity upon
                     your part, or downright simplicity. But how did it affect her?"
                  "She smiled as you have done, at the way in which I regarded the matter, but
                     seemed to believe me serious. What she said to me was: 'Have you come here
                     simply to tell me this?'
                  "'No,' was my answer—I have a message besides from the lady who gives a soiree
                     to-night, to which you are invited. She was fearful you might be unprovided
                     with an escort, and begged me to attend you to her house. As you are dressed
                     already you have no excuse for not attending!'
                  "She smiled again, but ultimately consented to accompany me.
                  "My expedition was a success, and we were soon conversing upon the most amiable
                     terms. My companion I discovered was as much a dreamer as myself, and evidently
                     believed in dreams as the only realities. She had a face of that soft, mobile,
                     yielding character which tempts to effort, and I was lucky enough on my way to
                     the soiree, and after our arrival, to obtain her undivided ear. You laugh at my
                     ignorance of the world, but jealousy upon this occasion prompted me to ward off
                     all dangerous rivals and introduce only those upon whose dullness I could
                     depend. By the time that the supper was over she had cried for mercy, and
                     avowed her readiness to return home. Once more I offered my services, and when
                     they were accepted, it was by the longest and most circuitous route that we set
                     out. Intoxicated with her presence and the champagne perhaps that had been
                     drunk, the gay company we had left, and the soft moonlight, I breathed, without
                     remembering the length of our acquaintance, as delicately as I could, my
                     devotion and love. We were both in the gayest of moods, and our conversation
                     was accompanied upon both sides with a sort of hysterical laughter. I remember
                     her reproaching me with my levity, and my telling her, which I think is the
                     truth, that laughter frequently accompanies our most earnest acts, and that my
                     smiles were like those of Sir Thomas More while awaiting the the axe of the
                     headsman.
                  "'But where are you taking me?' she finally demanded. 'I am not familiar with
                     these streets, but I know it is not the way home. The labyrinth into which you
                     are leading my feet is nothing to that in which you are conducting my
                     understanding.'
                  "'Is that the only answer to all I have said to you?'
                  "'Answer—my only excuse for listening to you at all is that you expected no
                     answer.'"
                  "'But when one says he is in love, it requires that at least one word should be
                     said upon the other side.'"
                  "'I must then say something?'"
                  "'Yes, that you can love me in return if you can.'
                  "'Unfortunately I am married already!'"
                  "'No, not that.'"
                  "I am telling you a very prosaic fact."
                  "A husband—you have really a husband?"
                  "You are the only person in the place that does not know it. You would have
                     discovered it yourself, if you had not prevented me from speaking to any other
                     company during the evening."
                  She laughed, for several minutes, in my face, looking at me very hard, as if
                     the matter was the most amusing thing in the world.
                  "'There's a mistake somewhere—it must be a very queer husband or a very queer
                     marriage. You can see that I have spoken to you with sincerity. Will you not
                     answer me frankly?'
                  "I am, in that case, a very foolish woman, who, at sixteen, fell in love,
                     without the consent of my guardian. I first went into hysterics; then wrote
                     verses about suicide; and finally eloped with my hero. It turned out as
                     everybody predicted. In six months the mask fell off, and my hero stood
                     revealed, a very ordinary mortal. He was interested in agriculture, and not at
                     all interested in verse, even when rhyming in his own praise. Consequently I
                     have brought my lyre with me to my former guardian's roof, disappointed and
                     discouraged! There is but a slight addition to be made to the story.'"
                  "'And that is that you have applied for a divorce?'" She blushingly
                     replied—
                  "'It is worse than that. I have applied and the application will undoubtedly be
                     granted as the case is now on trial—probably to-morrow.'
                  "'Practically, then, you are free and have no excuse for not answering.'"
                  We had by this time reached her home. At my last suggestion she ran inside and
                     closed the gate.
                  "'Do you thus shut me out of all hope?'"
                  "'I am not yet off with the old love—it is too early to commence with the new.
                     I could only give you a reversionary right to my hand.'"
                  The interview ended. I awoke the next morning with a headache, and a vague
                     consciousness that I had committed myself to a lady whom I had seen the evening
                     before for the first time, and of whom nearly all that I knew was that she was
                     already the wife of another! The worst of it was, that after thinking over the
                     matter, I could not decide whether the conversation on the other side had been
                     serious, or might not have been intended as a pleasantry.
                  "I hovered around the court the next day in the hopes of there learning
                     something, but the case was not called. I heard no allusion made to it on the
                     following day, or the day succeeding to that. I called, too, at the house, but
                     the mistress was never at home."
                  "Did you ascertain," I here inquired of Wandorf, "whether any suit had been
                     instituted when you visited the 
                        precints
                        precincts
                      of justice?"
                  "There was no doubt about that fact. The rendering up of judgment would only
                     have been a matter of form, if it had been demanded."
                  "You ought to have written and asked an interview or an explanation."
                  "That is what I did but before receiving an answer I discovered that the
                     husband had fallen heir, at the time of the stay of the proceedings, to a large
                     fortune. 'It must be a very unendurable husband with whom one cannot live when
                     he is rich,' I thought, and the answer I received tended to confirm my
                     conjecture."
                  "Did she tell you that love was a question of worldly gauds, to be studied by
                     the lamp of poverty?"
                  "To judge from the letter, the writer had but a faint recollection of anything
                     that had been said; and would have been willing to have forgiven me for having
                     prevailed upon her to drink too much champagne according to her own
                     explanation, had I not been so ungenerous as to allude to the conversation
                     which subsequently took place. Some one, she hoped, I would find upon whom to
                     lavish my devotion; but for herself, she was so unsuited to mingle in the
                     world, so impulsive and improvident, that henceforth she would have to deny
                     herself more than ever the pleasure of receiving her friends. The letter
                     terminated the acquaintance."
                  "Your story has a miserable ending for so romantic a commencement."
                  "'When you meet me again, and I tell you I am in mourning,' was one of the
                     phrases of the letter that long remained impressed on my memory, and which led
                     me to hope for awhile—'"
                  Before he could finish, Camille had rejoined us.
                  "What is all this romance you have been telling?" he inquired.
                  "I have been speaking of a heroine," replied Wandorf, "who I am to see
                     to-night. My friend here believes in presentiments. He has a presentiment in
                     the first place that we are to stay all night in this house. Secondly, that
                     each one of us is to see the friend he most values. Thirdly, that this is about
                     our last march. Fourthly—"
                  "There is no need of going any further," said our Mercury. "The first has
                     undoubtedly come true. We are to rest our bones here—we are to be transported
                     bodily to dreamland, into one of those abodes of elegance and refinement which
                     seems created by benevolent genii in response to a wish. Come, let us
                     enter."
                  We followed.
                  Previously, however, to narrating what immediately happened to us on entering,
                     let us occupy ourselves a moment with one of Camille's former adventures.
               
               
                  CAMILLE.
                  None of the young men who knew Camille Graves, (and they all knew him
                     intimately,) ever thought there was any likelihood that his wedding would ever
                     be chronicled. He was always falling in love foolishly; and always with such
                     eccentric characters as no one else would ever dream of. As his absurd fancies
                     would invariably end in the most capricious manner—about the time, as likely as
                     not, that he had inspired any sentiment—it did not seem probable that his
                     friends would ever be called upon to wear a white cravat and gloves, or bridal
                     favors in his behalf.
                  Indeed, Camille had long been known as a youth of unsettled habits, and being
                     naturally of a restless fidgetty disposition he was constantly hunting up queer
                     lodgings. After they were found he did not occupy his apartments much oftener
                     than do those rulers who are constantly dreading assassination.
                  None of the mildewed tenements in the Crescent City, that single lodgers climb
                     by dismal flights of stairs, but what has sheltered him; no one was more
                     familiar than he with the armoirs, bedsteads,
                     with red canopies, and immense pillows and other paraphernalia which constitute
                     the meubles of such apartments: he had never
                     seen a placard with chambre a louer that had
                     not tempted him to make inquiries; and, in short, he was well known to
                     landladies and boarding-house keepers of high and low degree gree. Upon some of his handkerchiefs he had
                     embroidered in grotesque style the figure of a goat cropping, shrubbery through
                     a fence; and the design did not seem 
                        incongurous
                        incongruous
                      with his own browsing disposition.
                  Upon one occasion he had determined to make a change in his quarters, and had
                     rung the bell of an old house, whose appearance had appealed to his fancy, and
                     made the customary inquiries for apartments to rent. These inquiries were
                     answered by an old woman in imperfect English, and the two then started upon a
                     tour of inspection. After all of the rooms had been examined without producing
                     much impression, the landlady stated that there still remained one more, which
                     was at the time occupied by a lady, but who would exchange it the next day for
                     another.
                  As the occupant, the landlady furthermore stated, was not at the time at home,
                     she ventured to show Graves the premises in question. The door to the room was
                     now opened, but it soon appeared there had been some mistake. The fair tenant
                     was not absent, but stood en deshabille
                     before a pier glass, lacing a small waist into still smaller compass. The
                     suffusion of her face and neck with blushes warned her unceremonious visitors
                     to retire; but when the toilet was at length completed the sanctuary was
                     opened—this time by its owner.
                  The latter now proved to be pretty and intelligent, and though somewhat
                     confused at the commencement of the acquaintance, disposed to talk. It
                     therefore followed that a much more careful examination was given to this room,
                     and more questions asked than had been demanded from any of the others. It now
                     occurred too to Graves to remark, upon observing that the apartment contained a
                     piano, that an instrument of that description would be for him an additional
                     inducement towards engaging a room; he even went so far as to beg from the
                     occupant the pleasure of hearing her touch its keys. When she had done so—when
                     she had informed him that she was a music teacher—and when she in turn had
                     discovered that Graves could play a little himself and sing second, a charming
                     acquaintance was already formed, and the room was secured without further
                     parley.
                  After this commencement it did not require a great length of time for their
                     acquaintance to ripen into something like intimacy. The lady proved to be a
                     music teacher of some repute, with some singular particulars of history which
                     were not lost upon Graves. Her father had been a consul in an Italian port; her
                     mother had been a Maltese Arab; her education she had obtained in Brusselles
                     and Paris. Her accomplishments were as various as those of the different
                     countries in which she had resided. Her religious beliefs—the most intimate of
                     her friends scarcely knew what they were. The soft name of Heloise, completed
                     the list of her attractions.
                  With that absence of prudery and affectation which she might have acquired with
                     her education, she maintained, for instance, her distrust of all affairs of the
                     heart; that she disbelieved even in the happiness that was derived from the
                     married state; and that she had resolved never to be affected either by cupid
                     or hymen; she had no relatives; she could obtain as many scholars in the best
                     families as she chose; she should therefore live independently; please herself;
                     fall into a platonic love, now and then with some one who might arouse her too
                     capricious fancy—whom she might find worth the trouble—but never embarrass
                     herself with the grande passion.
                  Coquetry of this kind in which the challenging party appeared as weak as she
                     was amiable—-where a series of amusing incidents might be made to terminate
                     with an unembarrassing conquest—a dare of this sort, Graves found hard to
                     resist. But this ardor was somewhat dampened, when, as he might have expected,
                     he soon discovered that a dozen rivals, in spite of all the lady's
                     protestations and averments, were equally infatuated.
                  But the discovery was made too late for him to hesitate: he lost no time in
                     employing those arts which he had frequently before found so successful.
                     "Beauty has a sweet tooth," he reasoned, "and makes no concessions which are
                     not preceded by visits to the theatres and ice cream saloons"; he therefore
                     fastened to partake in sweet union with her, of the glace, biscuits, boned turkey,
                     and other tempting delicacies which wily traiteurs hold out for the perdition of rash youth. Camille,
                     furthermore, soon discovered that however indifferent Heloise might be to the
                     tender sentiment, the depletion of his pocket-book attested the vigor of her
                     appetite; that becoming curious upon one occasion as to her capacity for wine
                     drinking, he had found she could carry a bottle of champagne under her
                     diminutive belt with no appearance of trouble, and that after the experiment he
                     had been indebted to her for finding his way home and not she to him.
                  "But there must be an end to everything," thought Camille, and he resolved to
                     come to an understanding. One night the two walked pensively from one of the
                     places or amusement, discoursing of the story they had just heard, or
                     occasionally giving away to poetic ejaculations about the beauty and serenity
                     of the night. The attitude of Camille's companion encouraged him in the
                     resolution he had formed. Her arm was closely locked through his; her face was
                     turned musingly upward and she was uttering, as if in a delicious reverie, a
                     thousand pretty nothings, as if her thoughts, too, had penetrated beyond the
                     stars.
                  "She is evidently very hungry to-night," thought Camille. "The last time she
                     was in this mood I had to order everything the restaurant contained before I
                     succeeded in finding anything that hit her fancy. But after all she is a
                     good-natured, lively girl, and in spite of her faults, if she would but be
                     serious a moment, I would make an honest declaration of my love. I shall
                     persevere for fifteen minutes."
                  "Where are you carrying me?" M'lle Heloise at length interrupted his
                     reflections to inquire.
                  "There is a new saloon which has just been fitted up, and which should be at
                     one of these entrances just in front of us. You shall decide, as they are both
                     brilliantly lighted, which of the stair cases we are to mount."
                  Heloise did decide, and mounting forthwith the steps to which she gave the
                     preference, they passed into a room which it was soon seen was not the right
                     one. It was presided over by a dealer of cards, crowded with spectators, and
                     where various sums of money were being hazarded upon a tapis vert. A respectably dressed lady, or indeed one of any
                     kind, was a rara avis at such an exhibition,
                     and the sight, it need hardly be said, attracted every eye. But a colored
                     waiter, who had been momentarily absent from post, now ran and informed
                     them—what they knew already—of their mistake.
                  "Take me away from here quickly, or I shall die with mortification," cried
                     Heloise.
                  They were already at the head of the stairs, and Camille construed her command
                     literally. Supporting her form with his arm, he descended the stairs so rapidly
                     that she had to cling to his neck to keep from falling backwards. Such haste
                     was made in escaping that a large part of the lady's dress, which had caught
                     upon the door, was left behind.
                  "Put me to the ground, stupid booby," cried Heloise, completely out of
                     patience, when they reached the bottom of the stairs. "Who ever dreamed of
                     carrying a lady before in so rude a manner. The bare idea of my feet dangling
                     down in that absurd fashion!"
                  Camille was profuse in his apologies, and once or twice, imprudently enough at
                     the time, endeavored to give expression to the idea that was uppermost in his
                     mind.
                  "I shall never forgive you," said his companion, "or rather I shall never
                     forgive myself."
                  "I have given her a fair chance," thought Camille, becoming impatient, "one
                     cannot depend upon her mood for a moment. I shall hunt up new quarters
                     tomorrow."
                  "I can see now which way all of this is tending."
                  "All of what?"
                  "Let us speak plainly. What is it you wish?"
                  "I have had some faint hope of winning your love."
                  "You are unsuccessful," said Heloise, 
                        recoving
                        recovering
                     , but not showing, at this announcement a return to her good humor. "I
                     do not love you."
                  Camille did not seem to hear.
                  "I do not love you," repeated Heloise: "you are not, in the first place, worth
                     the trouble of winning." And she looked at him curiously, as if to know how far
                     it would be safe to amuse herself further at his expense.
                  Camille meanwhile reflected: "She has cost me enough money for slippers,
                     amusements, presents and Shellroad turnouts to have kept me going for the
                     winter. And, after all, I am only moderately interested. It is rather hard to
                     be laughed at in this way, and be the only sufferer."
                  "Are you asleep, Mr. Camille? For you see I am dealing frankly. The fact is,
                     that—that I am to be married soon."
                  "Your conduct has been a little singular, for lady who is engaged. Your
                     intended has at confiding disposition."
                  "Undoubtedly. My eccentricities amuse him. He laughs at the pains my friends
                     make to ruin themselves, and at the funny speeches they make me."
                  "You have, then thought it worth your while to tell him? He must be the prince
                     of lovers. You need never fear exciting his jealousy. But here we are at home.
                     Before separating, let me say"—
                  "You wish me not to tell? You need not fear. I am not quite done with some of
                     those that remain."
                  "You interrupted me too soon. I was only about to say good night." Camille
                     good-naturedly extended his hand.
                  "Good night!" said Heloise. She took his hand, but did not release it.
                  "Is there anything more to be said?" inquired Camille.
                  "Do you believe everything I have told you, fully?"
                  "No—not fully."
                  "About what do you think I am mistaken?"
                  "I think you are mistaken altogether."
                  Heloise began to think she had not answered his declaration of love in the
                     right way, and that she had gone a step too far.
                  "What I said just now, Camille, you understand was a plaisanterie?"
                  "Yes, I thought we understood that. Good night."
                  It was now the turn of Heloise to feel astonished. The tide was rapidly
                     turning, and it was turning the wrong way to please Heloise.
                  "This Monsieur Camille is, after all, not so stupid," she mentally thought.
                     "There is something about him I cannot quite understand."
                  "You are wrong," she said aloud, "Monsieur Camille, to give me up so
                     easily."
                  "You have said yourself that it was all settled between us."
                  "On the contrary, it is nothing of the kind."
                  She put her arm softly around his neck, and looked up into his face; but it did
                     not move him.
                  There was but one step further she could take in advance. Even Heloise,
                     although an old coquette, blushed to say the next words.
                  "Camille, mon amie, I am absolutely in love
                     with you; since you will have me, say it; you will not take your revenge with a
                     woman by remaining silent."
                  "No, but at the same time there is but one thing to be said. Mademoiselle: We
                     have both been a couple of fools, and have both been punished. I have wasted my
                     money and time on an old coquette, for whom, at the last moment, I have to
                     admit that I do not care. You are momentarily deceiving yourself in imagining
                     that you feel any attachment. We are at the residence of your friends. To quote
                     your own words, before retiring: 'I do not love you; I am to marry somebody
                     else soon:' and lastly, I do not think you worth the trouble of winning.'"
               
            
            
               THE DENOUEMENT.
               Let us return to the mansion through whose portals we were entering.
               As to what now happened it seemed to me more like a dream than anything else that
                  I can compare it to. One event succeeded the other so rapidly that the whole
                  affair seemed more like a transformation than a daylight reality.
               We had entered into one of those old abodes of opulence and wealthy, which had as
                  yet been undisturbed by the agitations and disasters of war; a place which still
                  had about it, an air of indolent ease and refinement. From being outcast, we had
                  suddenly entered an atmosphere of quiet elegance.
               The servant whom we met at the door ushered us into a chamber, in which lights had
                  already been placed, and upon whose hearth a ruddy fire was already burning. A
                  half an hour's toil enabled us to remove the evidences of travel from our dress—to
                  make some almost incredible changes in our costume—to, in fact, affect a sort of
                  half brigand dandyism in our dress.
               At the last moment, when our preparations had been all completed, Wandorf suddenly
                  thought to ask—
               "But in what extraordinary way did you succeed in securing such comfortable
                  quarters? People are not so hospitable nowadays as to invite the first new comers
                  to the furnished chamber."
               "The fact is," said our guide, "our quarters are not yet quite secured. But now
                  that we are dressed, and can make our appearance before mistress of the
                  mansion—"
               "And you have not seen her?" inquired Wandorf, in a tone of stupefaction.
               "Why, no—not yet," said the traitor; "the fact is—"
               "The fact is," said Wandorf proudly, "that I prefer to sleep like a dog in the mud
                  and rain to entering a house where I am not certain of a welcome."
               He made a hurried movement towards the door by which he had entered.
               Apparently my dream and happy presentiments were rapidly melting away. Still
                  although I followed him, I did so half curiously, but with hardly any doubt.
               As we passed silently through the long hall way, and came to the front door
                  entrance, it did not astonish me to find that it was locked.
               It did not surprise me, before the door was finally opened, that three of the
                  occupants of the hospital mansion should
                  have been attracted to the scene—
               That one of the party should be received and welcomed by the lady of the house as
                  if he had been an old guest. Lastly, I had arrived at that point that it did not
                  astonish me that we were led into the drawing-room—that a folding-door should now
                  be thrown open, and that we should see lighted by wax tapers a supper room that
                  would have delighted Lucullus or Apicius after a long march.
               But as we first entered the drawingroom and became fully exposed to the light, the
                  scene and conversation that followed fairly surpassed my most visionary
                  imaginings, and put to route all my attempts at philosophical conjecture.
               "You are welcome, Mr. Wandorf, you and your friends," said the fair hostess. "I
                  heard that your regiment would be marching in this direction, and never doubted
                  that you would do me the honor of paying me a passing visit."
               Wandorf was the perfect picture of surprise. "Is there not some mistake here," he
                  said, "as to identity. Am I really in the presence of the Idalie whom I knew
                  before the war?"
               "And you are telling me," was the blushing reply, "that you did not expect to see
                  me here—that you and your friends found their way to my house by accident."
               "Our lucky star, madame, has taken pity on us for the four years hardships that we
                  have been compelled to endure, and has made one of us at least the victim of a
                  delightful enchantment, in some way that I do not pretend to understand. The
                  gentlemen with me are a couple of comrades. I present them," he added, in a tone
                  of mad exaltation, "to a lady whose charms were once only too dangerous. Will you
                  believe, madame, that it was not half au hour ago that I was telling them of an
                  old flame who would have given her preference to me had she not already found a
                  worthier claimant to her hand."
               "It is for this worthy claimant you now see me in mourning," was her reply, which
                  was accompanied with the downcast look of coquetry or pious resignation.
               I had scarcely needed their words, so much was I occupied on my own account with a
                  surprise that had overtaken me. I was awakened by a formal presentation.
               "Since it has come to explanations," I said, "let me repay one introduction by
                  another. The lady whom I have the honor of presenting, promised me at our last
                  interview to make me, the next time we met, the happiest of men."
               A blushing protest and a faint attempt at denial from the fair party presented,
                  confirmed rather than gainsayed any explanation.
               Camille, who from having been previously acquainted with four of the party, began
                  now to suspect he knew as much about the fulfillment of my presentiments as
                  anybody. An observation from him will be all that the reader cannot himself
                  guess.
               "I have seen before the only lady that remains in this happy party to be disposed
                  of, and it seems to me that I have some rights in the matter from having brought
                  about so charming a tableau. If she will allow me," he concluded with the gallant
                  air of a Marquis of the old regime, "to be
                  guided by feelings and presentiments, it will not be long before I can speak as
                  confidently of the future as my friends have of the past and present."
               Of course, the lady in question was the Heloise whose history has been
                  related.
            
            
               THE LATE M. UGALDE.
               Some attention, not to say notoriety, is naturally enough always attracted to an
                  old and wealthy citizen at his death. The interest is of course doubled when the
                  character of the deceased was strongly defined, or eccentric.
               It consequently need hardly be stated then that about the late M. Ugalde, though
                  an extremely quiet citizen, a great deal of gossip and a number of reports have
                  originated injurious to surviving parties.
               To shield those, whose names need not be mentioned, from unmerited obloquy as his
                  nearest surviving relation, is my task on the present occasion, as well as to
                  explain certain traits which, though mere faults, have been construed into crimes.
                  The facts given below, in the form of two or three pictures, have been mostly
                  taken from a journal with which I have been accustomed from an early age to occupy
                  my time.
               Instead of publishing a card of denial in reference to the stories concerning his
                  once contemplated marriage, or the alleged violent manner of his death, I have
                  thought that a detailed account of all I saw and heard of him during the two or
                  three interviews, as his probable heir, I held with him in his lifetime, would
                  best set matters right with all parties.
               
                  It was when he proposed to adopt we as his heir that I first heard the name of
                     Mr. Ugalde. He had always previously avoided the society of his relatives, and
                     indeed society of most kinds. I was now formally spoken of as his successor,
                     perhaps because if his strong dislike to others who entertained claims upon his
                     succession, or through a momentary sense of his loneliness. At that time I had
                     not completed my minority, and was extremely ignorant of received usage.
                  Upon the day upon which I was to be transferred to his residence a carriage had
                     been in attendance. Inside of this, I found upon entering, was an elderly
                     gentleman with a snuffy nose, and who was to take charge of my education. He
                     was attended by what appeared to be a confidential servant, whose manners
                     indicated discretion and experience. The name of the elderly gentleman, I soon
                     discovered, was, Bruno. The servant was addressed, as is frequently the case
                     with French servants, as Francois. Having been placed on the seat beside
                     Francois, the door of the carriage was banged to with a noise which filled me
                     with uncomfortable misgivings, and we proceeded on our way.
                  The conversation thereupon followed which at good natured elderly gentleman
                     would have with a youth whom he wished to place at his ease, and who found
                     while doing this that some information might also be indirectly added to his
                     own stores. What suggested this turn to the dialogue was a naive inquiry I
                     addressed him as to the character of M. Ugalde.
                  "Is he a very good man?" I asked, feeling somewhat doubtful as to what would be
                     my treatment. The question, through timidity, I addressed to the servant.
                  The latter repeated the question after me as if it was too difficult for him to
                     give a correct answer.
                  The elderly gentlemen, M. Bruno, who spoke with the polite 
                        periphrase
                        paraphrase
                      once common with all whole maternal tongue was French, coughed in a
                     perplexed way, but finally added that M. Ugalde hardly made any pretensions of
                     the sort—"any pretensions to being a very good man. He lives as he thinks a man
                     of taste ought to live—that is if he has ever given the matter a thought. It is
                     not very easy to say what Monsieur the uncle's character is—n'est-ce pas, Francois?"
                  "He does not resemble most men," said Francois, discreetly.
                  "You have been with him a great many years, and ought to understand him as well
                     as anybody."
                  "I was raised as a servant in the family. He was an altogether different man as
                     I first remember him from what he is now. He was considered a pushing and
                     driving man in those days, and was up early and late."
                  "Yes; I can see that he must have been a business man at one time, from his
                     ledgers and books which I am now employed in settling. I remember, too, that he
                     was largely interested in the first steamship line, and was active in building
                     the St. —— Hotel. He was always organizing something. What was the name of that
                     immense sugar plantation which be used to own, and for which he paid nearly a
                     million and a half dollars?"
                  "It was called the Serapion Place when he owned it."
                  "And could you understand how he succeeded so remarkably the season when every
                     one else failed?"
                  "He had studied the art of granulating sugar profoundly in the West India
                     Islands and France, and probably understood it better than any other man in the
                     State."
                  "Still it did not keep him from losing, and from ultimately being nearly
                     ruined."
                  "That was in the year when sugar was down to two or three cents a pound, and he
                     had met with two or three reverses elsewhere."
                  "It was that year that he tried to commit suicide, and you prevented him, was
                     it not?"
                  "That was the year, but there was some other trouble besides."
                  "What was that?"
                  "He objected to any steamboat landing at the plantation, and warned them that
                     he would fire into them if they did. He gave instructions in fact to that
                     effect."
                  
                  "Were they carried out?"
                  "The order was obeyed when the next boat attempted to make a landing. Two men
                     were killed and fell overboard."
                  "I remember it, I remember it now—that was a shocking affair—shocking," said
                     Mr. Bruno, with considerable show of feeling; "I saw the bodies when they were
                     brought to the shore, all decayed, and half eaten up with crawfish. I have
                     never been able to eat any of the latter at table from that day to this.
                     Doubtless the loss of so much money weighed on his mind. But it is probable
                     that this tragedy affected him equally as much. It was thought at the time that
                     when he gave the order he never expected it would result as it did.
                  "He was not generally looked upon as a bad man by those who knew him, except
                     when in his violent moods. There was at one time more than a thousand hands
                     upon the place, and those that wished to learn he educated according to their
                     inclination as blacksmiths, carpenters, and so on. He let those learn to read
                     that would, and gave his head workmen wine and the same food he had upon his
                     table every day. He gave me my freedom, and several others who still remain in
                     his service."
                  "And you think that all of his troubles have affected his life?"
                  "That and his contemplated marriage, though he never says anything about it. He
                     seems now to have gone back somewhat to his tastes when a young man, or to be
                     amusing himself with those he has recently acquired."
                  We arrived at my uncle's residence without further adventure.
                  Looking at it for the first time as we descended and entered, I was struck with
                     an air of grotesquerie and gloom which appeared in the building, and for which
                     I could not at the time altogether account. It was one of the few residences
                     there were in the city that were built of granite. The solidity of the
                     materials, the smoothness of the walls, which were not perpendicular, but which
                     sloped gently to the top—the absence of many windows, all gave it the
                     appearance of a citadel or mausoleum. What contributed to this impression was
                     that it was built upon a street principally inhabited by outcasts, and that it
                     overlooked a cemetery.
                  Some of the lofty monuments adorned with emblematic troupes of statuary in
                     various attitudes of grief and woe, could be seen on the walls. But what more
                     than all struck my youthful fancy, was that upon the corners of the house and
                     immediately over the wide portico, were placed four large lions or sphynxes,
                     who were gazing upon the world around and below with a cold and philosophical
                     gaze.
                  The carriage having entered beneath a covered archway, M. Bruno and Francois
                     mounted to announce our arrival. I was permitted, as a favor, to look through a
                     garden and the house itself until I should be summoned.
                  The grounds, I soon discovered, had apparently at one time been carefully laid
                     out in squares and parterres. There were all manner of plants and vines, some
                     native to the soil, some exotic, which grew in the beds or which hung suspended
                     in censor-like flower-boxes. A very old palm-tree which had a singular history
                     of its own grew in the centre of the garden, and the ever-present orange-tree
                     and wide-leafed banana. Shadowed by those were stages of classical and
                     mythological characters of Pluto, Memnon, Prometheus, the blind Belisarius, and
                     the Laocoon—of Niobe, Iphegenia, Pasiphae and Medea. Each one of them in their
                     name was suggestive of some gloomy story, and the shallow that resided in the
                     name was farther increased by the mouldered and mildewed condition to which
                     they were abandoned. But there were not neglected more than the vines and
                     flowers. The ground had become so thickly covered with shadowy foliage as to
                     look damp and unhealthy, and altogether it rather resembled an Indian jungle
                     than the ornamental garden for which it had been originally intended.
                  Finding but little pleasure in this anything but Paradisaical retreat, and
                     becoming annoyed and affected by the sight of some strange birds and wild
                     animals that were confined in cages, and which chattered and screeched at me as
                     I passed, I hastened in doors.
                  The scene within was not more suggestive of domestic comfort, and was entirely
                     destitute of that character which is given to an establishment by the presence
                     of woman. It was obvious, even to a child, that it was not the abode of any of
                     the opposite sex.
                  The furniture was of costly enough pattern, but appeared old rather from
                     neglect than too frequent use. A great deal of it was still packed in the
                     different apartments of the house, and but little care had been evinced in its
                     preservation. Everything indicated the little consideration in which the
                     establishment had been regarded by its owner.
                  Francois, whom I subsequently discovered, held my uncle's whims and caprices in
                     the greatest awe, and who although he dressed in bizarre colors,
                     betrayed a sort of imitation of him in his costume—Francois was not averse to
                     answering my questions about what I saw, though he did it without any
                     unnecessary waste of words.
                  "Why was not the furniture put in use which I see piled up in some of the
                     rooms?" I inquired.
                  "It was what Mons. your uncle brought with him from Paris upon his last visit,
                     although he might perhaps have obtained just as good here. The home-made
                     furniture, however, does not please him. The country, he says, only produces
                     cypress wood, and that, he thinks, is fit only to make coffins.
                  "Your uncle," said Mr. Bruno, apologetically, "has a taste for the antiquities,
                     and he admires the cypress: first, because it is despised by his friends;
                     secondly, because it was the emblem of immortality among the Egyptians, and
                     furnished the coffins for the heroes and great men of Athens. If you were,
                     perhaps a little older, you would have observed its dark, melancholy foliage
                     among the plants in his garden."
                  "But why, Francois, does he not use his furniture, now that he has purchased
                     it?"
                  "He had not intended doing so when he ordered it. He likes to know that he has
                     such articles upon hand in case of need."
                  "And those pictures and busts, do they always remain with their faces to the
                     wall?"
                  "Except when he turns them for his own use. He objects to their being exposed
                     to the criticisms of visitors who would not understand their merits."
                  The busts were mostly of the Roman emperors who were only distinguished by
                     their gluttony or crimes. One of the pictures represented Sardanapalus at a
                     feast, on the night which was to be his last, and another with the motto of
                        De'enda est Carthago. was of the six days'
                     fight of the housetops, which resulted in the abasement of Rome's African
                     rival, and in which the wife of the Carthagenian general was represented as
                     throwing her children into the flames of the burning city.
                  "But who in this the picture of? It ought to be of Cleopatra, though there is
                     no asp applied to her breast, and besides the costume is too modern," inquired
                     M. Bruno.
                  "That frame, you will observe by the dust, is rarely turned. It is of the lady,
                     of whom you spoke in the carriage—that is of Madame Marie ——."
                  Before the sentence was finished the door of my uncle's room was heard to open
                     and Francois, with a guilty air which contrasted oddly enough with his ordinary
                     dignity, hastily turned the picture to the wall.
                  We now approached the room in which my uncle attended to us, and on my part
                     with a mind not a little puzzled to know what to make of the character of
                     almost my only relative. The next traits that I saw revealed troubled me still
                     more as to what to think.
                  On entering, M. Ugalde was discovered surveying himself in a full length
                     mirror. He had the air of a man who had finished an important labor, and who
                     was satisfied with his success. He was dressed elaborately, and held in his
                     hand a handkerchief scented with the last perfume of the day. At the time, I
                     saw no evidence of the traits of character which I had been led to expect from
                     the appearance of the establishment, and from the conversation to which I had
                     just listened.
                  Having disposed of his own dress, and examined himself in a pier glass as
                     critically from head to foot as if he had been a young man just commencing a
                     career of folly, he turned his attention to me. He did not salute me, but
                     regarded me attentively. My appearance did not please him. He spoke of my
                     manners and dress to Francois as if I had not been present, and in a manner
                     that would have exasperated any one ignorant or otherwise of the world, to the
                     last degree.
                  His tone was so cold that I begged that he would reconsider his proposal of
                     naming me as his heir. A request that to any one else would have been
                     considered an affront, and would have perhaps ended all intercourse had the
                     effect upon him of a menace that was to be dreaded. He made no answer to my
                     demand beyond leading the way impatiently to the breakfast table, and never
                     afterward, (with an exception soon to be named,) interfered for good or bad
                     with my pursuits, one way or the other.
               
               
                  A Dinner In Respectable Company.
                  I have now stated in detail my first impressions of M. Ugalde, and what I at
                     the time learned of his character from those who knew him best. At that period
                     of his life he appeared to have no serious occupation for his time unless his
                     studies and theories on the subject of gastronomy might be considered as such.
                     In fact the dishes and wines that he drank occupied his time to the exclusion
                     of almost everything else., He showed in this, as he did upon most subjects,
                     that he was a man of great capacity, and were it not at the risk of making my
                     description too long, an amusing chapter might be easily written upon what
                     might be called his table philosophy. The purposes of this narrative will only
                     admit that I now relate one more conversation that occurred at a dinner to
                     which my uncle once invited some of his friends, and at which the subject of
                     eating was the Alpha and Omega of every remark that was made:
                  
                     First Speaker—Can you tell me who the fat old gentleman is at the
                     other end of the table with the spectacles and red nose? He looks more good
                     natured than most of those who are present.
                  
                     Second Speaker—You are right. The old man commenced life as a
                     waiter in one of our restaurants—acquired a fortune, was swindled out of it,
                     and reduced to his former position. He again appeared with an apron upon his
                     stomach, became once more wealthy, and has retired from business. He is really
                     the best judge of good dishes of any man in the city. But his value to our host
                     is that he always supports, or rather anticipates, his decisions, a matter
                     which is not very difficult, since he has taken his orders the best part of his
                     life.
                  "Not a great while since, the ex-restaurateur gave his daughter's hand in
                     marriage to the tip-top swell who sits at the opposite end of the room, and
                     whose name is St. M—-. The family of the latter was rather obscure; but St. M——
                     succeeded in getting in with a fast crowd, to retain whose friendship he has
                     been known to deny all relationship with his own mother and sisters. On the
                     night of the wedding, I need hardly state that he had on hand the best known of
                     the class who promenade in patent leathers and pick their teeth around
                     first-class restaurants. The wedding was really a showy affair; the fiancee was resplendent in orange blossoms and
                     diamonds; the supper table had received the especial care of the bride's
                     father, and was a miracle of success; and St. M—— who knew his father-in-law's
                     occupation, and had been apprehensive, congratulated himself more and more upon
                     the success of the entertainment.
                  "Still there was one drawback. Monsieur, le
                        pere, was uncorking the champagne regardless of expense, and St.
                     M. had to regret that a large part of it, in a answer to frequent toasts, found
                     its way down his father-in-law's throat. In short, the old man set the
                     revellers a glorious example in spite of the winks and nudges of his son; he at
                     last stood upon his feet and commenced addressing the crowd. Once started, he
                     dwelled with pride upon his early struggles—upon the curses and imprecations
                     which he had received as a waiter, but which had yet not kept him from making
                     his way in life. Catching his son-in-law's eye, he promised to the assembled
                     guests that he should have his blessing and support, that the same four-posted
                     bedstead in which he slept himself 30 years before, and in which his daughter
                     was born, should be her's to commence housekeeping, and that the old horse hair
                     trunk (every hair of which he regarded as a souvenir of happy days) should
                     bring to his son-in-law the same success and prosperity that had attended its
                     first owner.
                  "The sensation which this speech produced upon the minds of the guests beggars
                     description. It was amusing enough in itself, but it was remembered that St.
                     M—— married to improve his fortunes; and the gift of the old bedstead, horse
                     hair trunk, and similar relics of household furniture sounded to the guests
                     like a death-knell to these expectations. A great many believed at the time
                     that the ex-restaurateur knew what he was
                     saying and doing, and that his drunkenness was only affected. He had been
                     violently opposed to his daughter's marriage to St. M——, whom he detested; and
                     detecting his son-in-law's character, and having no shame about having been a
                        restaurateur himself, he had taken that
                     opportunity of reciting his dislike.
                  "St. M—— is a handsome fellow. If the other sex goes by looks as they say they
                     do, I can easily understand how he came to win his wife.
                  He certainly seems to be popular in that quarter. The winter before his
                     marriage he became involved with a girl who at one time sold oranges at one of
                     our fruit stalls. The poor girl was violently in love with him; but whether it
                     is that medicine is as jealous a mistress as Coke describes law to be, the
                     devotion of the pretty fruit-seller was but indifferently returned. If his
                     features appear 
                        chisseled
                        chiseled
                      from marble, it is perhaps because nature has made his heart of the
                     same material. The matter resulted as it nearly always does where a woman loves
                     above her station. St. M. carried the orange girl to one of the dance houses which abound in
                     her neighborhood, and the excitement and liquor she was made to drink, did the
                     work that might have been expected. St. M. was thoughtful enough not to abandon
                     her, until he had conveyed her to her home; but unfortunately her friends
                     refused to suffer her to remain. Thus deserted by every one, the poor girl
                     drowned herself in a cistern. But to conclude the story, said the speaker, as
                     he filled his plate afresh, a Coroner's inquest was soon after held upon the
                     body. Will you believe that St. M. assisted at the deliberations of the jury,
                     made the post-mortem examination himself before the City Physician could be
                     notified, and recommended a verdict of accidental drowning? It is nevertheless
                     true."
                  The restaurateur thus spoken of was my tutor,
                     M. Bruno, whose occupation had been as described. His son-in-law was my uncle's
                     physician. Of the latter, the following story was also related by one of the
                     speakers:
                  Apropos of attempts at suicide, the last story related by those best posted in
                     matters of gossip, is of an old adventurer who came to this city some time ago,
                     and who took apartments with an old lodging-house deeper of somewhat doubtful
                     color, language and nationality. The latter, partly as a washer of laces,
                        (blanchisseuse en fin.) partly by leasing
                     rooms, partly by acting as a sick nurse in time of epidemics, contrived to live
                     along comfortably, and upon holidays with some show of style in dressing.
                  Meanwhile, the adventurer had taken sick with the dengue fever, and had it not
                     been for careful nursing would have commenced the journey upon which the
                     traveler carries no baggage—not even a carpetbag. In fact the attending
                     physician who valued his time and perhaps his fees, had dismissed the case as
                     hopeless with a professional shake of the head.
                  At this juncture the old nurse took the patient in hand, and by dint of simple
                     treatment, soon made him work around.
                  The old nurse going out one day left the patient, in the hands of her daughter,
                     a young and inexperienced girl, with instructions to allow him during her
                     absence nothing but the customary low diet of gruel, and such like. Instead of
                     following these instructions, the daughter yielded to the entreaties of the
                     patient when the back of the old nurse was turned, and soon after brought from
                     a neighboring restaurant a sumptuous dinner for two, of gracecs, snipe, fish,
                     etc., with enough wine to give the meal a good start. Instead of partaking
                     moderately as he had promised, the wretched patient soon consumed every dish by
                     his own exertions alone, bones and all.
                  The consequences of all this was that the old nurse soon after found him with
                     the mortal 
                        palor
                        pallor
                      overspreading his face which usually precedes death.
                  Nevertheless she did not despair, and brought him a round the second time.
                  The termination of the matter came with the departures of one of the outward
                     bound steamships. The sick patient had recovered and was carrying from the city
                     more flesh than he had brought with him. Still the old nurse and her daughter
                     were left behind, and were shedding tears at his departure.
                  These latter, however, were not precisely those of friendship. The fact was
                     that the convalescent patients had as tokens of his gratitude emitted the
                     formality of paying for his room on leaving, and he had, after destroying her
                     innocence, abandoned to despair the daughter.
                  
                  The conversations above, given merely as an illustration of my uncle's friends,
                     had occurred during the earlier portion of the meal. As the feast progressed,
                     there was some changing of places, and I ultimately found myself near Mr.
                     Bruno.
                  "Is all of my uncle's interest in cooking real," I inquired, observing the
                     occupation of the other guests; "or has it been so long an affectation with him
                     that it now seems a part of his character?"
                  "Nobody well knows—not even his best friends—if any one is regarded by him in
                     that light. I have at times thought him haunted by some unhappy reflection or
                     remorse of which he never speaks, and that rather than show his weariness and
                     discontent, he chooses to make himself a little absurd and amuse himself with
                     this melancholy farce secretly laughing at the flattery of his guests, until it
                     has become part of his character."
                  "What is the disappointment in life that is supposed to have affected him?"
                  "Some old love story. I believe it is always pretended to be that."
                  "Everybody else is too much absorbed in discussing the last culinary marvel to
                     pay attention. You can tell me and be discreet."
                  "The affair took place some years ago," said Bruno, "and to say that there was
                     a disappointment is to say that there was a lady in the case. I remember rather
                     vaguely the facts. But I shall never forget the appearance of of the young lady
                     in question. Her first name was Marie; and were I to select from all whom I can
                     now remember, who made the most impression upon me by modest, maidenly
                     deportment, it seems to me it would have been her. We associate the better
                     womanly qualities with the name of Mary, whether written in French or English;
                     and there was something about her general appearance and manners that was fully
                     in keeping with the idea. She had blue eyes and golden hair, and her
                     eyelashes—what you do not always find with people with hair of that color—were
                     long and of a darker hue. Her manners was innocence itself; her smile showed a
                     happy, contented disposition, as well as teeth which were like so many pearls,
                     and her soft rippling laugh was a thing to be remembered long after."
                  "And to jump at the natural conclusion," said I, for Bruno's rather elaborate
                     description awakened in me a suspicion that he was drawing on his imaginations
                     for half of his material, "the conclusion to be naturally arrived at was that
                     my uncle was enamored of this paragon." I thought that if I interrupted him in
                     the midst of his rather smooth narrative I would more accurately and quickly
                     get at the truth.
                  "You are right; the parties were thought to be devotedly attached to each
                     other, and preparations were at one time made for their wedding."
                  Bruno was discontented at having been interrupted in his story, and it now
                     became necessary to ask questions.
                  And what prevented this happy consummation?
                  "Unfortunately it was not prevented until a day or two preceding the
                     marriage.
                  "At that time the bride that was to be suddenly disappeared altogether with
                     some one whom, according to one cruel and unjust rumor, nobody could remember
                     to have previously seen in her company.
                  "The lady was never afterwards met nor even alluded to by your uncle."
                  "And is she dead? Is she living in the city?"
                  "It is not known what ever became of her. She must have died. She could not
                     with her personal appearance have gone in company and failed to have attracted
                     attention. Her face, indeed, was one of that spiritual beauty that reminded you
                     of the faint echo of ravishing music sic—one that inspired sentiment in every
                     glance and gesture. If ever a man wa justified in allowing his judgment and
                     reason to become unsettled and unsteadied by any woman, it was by her."
                  "And does M. Ugalde regret her still?"
                  "Regret her? You may well say that. He never, as I have already stated, alludes
                     to the matter. But it is impossible to suppose her absent from his thoughts. It
                     was her picture, you may remember to have remarked, that you saw turned to the
                     wall. If the truth was known he would probably at this day sacrifice his
                     fortune, or what he values more, his cook, to obtain one repentant or loving
                     glance from Mlle Marie's eyes."
                  "And is that all you have to tell me of my uncle's contemplated marriage?"
                  "That is all I know of the matter, except that one report represents that his
                     former fiancee is now dying of a broken
                     heart. As for himself I do not know, as he has not been more confidential to me
                     than to others, that the matter has positively affected a character that may
                     already have been previously followed, one way or the other."
                  "But whose fault, M. Bruno, was it that the estrangement took place?"
                  "The question is a little difficult to answer—perhaps through faults or
                     mistakes of character on both sides. One whisper was that it arose from a
                     criticism of some impulsive action on the part of the lady, and a malapropos
                     quotation of Cæsar, in reference to what should be the virtue of his wife.
                     Another was, that the expression of suspicion had been still stronger, and that
                     Mario had sacrificed her attachment to what she deemed a justifiable pride of
                     sex. But to return to the contemplated marriage, an estate was left and a suit
                     grew out——"
                  "If it is a law suit don't tell me, I won't understand it."
                  Mr. Bruno made a grimace and gesture, which intimated that he thought himself
                     unfortunate in his listener.
                  I caught my uncle's eye at this moment, and I fancied from its expression that
                     he must have guessed our conversation.
                  A moment after the guests arose from the table, and he passed near us in going
                     to the parlor.
                  "I think you were telling me before dinner you have completed your education at
                     the institute at which you have been attending."
                  My answer, of course, was in the affirmative.
                  "In that case a few years of study, or, at least, travel is what you now
                     require. Your tutor, M. Bruno, I give carte
                        blanche to assist you with letters and with preparations for your
                     departure." And he passed on before I had sufficiently recovered to make any
                     reply.
                  Knowing his character, though not precisely the motive for his conduct, I
                     completed my arrangements the next day and waited upon him before leaving to
                     pay my parting call.
                  But M. Ugalde did not apparently think my departure was a matter of enough
                     importance to demand a separate interview. He sent his adieux by Francois.
                  I made bold to inquire through the same messenger how long my absence was to
                     continue.
                  The answer was until I should receive an imperative summons to return.
                  I remained absent for several years, when I received a letter commanding me to
                     return. The summons was indeed imperative.
               
               
                  Plutonian Shadows.
                  A latter had reached me through M. Bruno, which announced the sickness of my
                     uncle and the near approach of death.
                  I lost no time in returning to the city. It was on Sunday that I reached his
                     residence. The streets at the time were deserted. The population was either
                     occupied with the religious services of the day, or had remained home, and the
                     quietude without was a fitting prelude to the scene I was now called upon to
                     witness.
                  On entering the house I found that most of the old friends with whom my uncle
                     had been accustomed to associate, were seated in the different rooms quietly
                     smoking, or discussing their customary topics. The decanters and glasses upon
                     the buffet had evidently been used, and in the philosophical turn of the
                     conversation there was the tone of resignation which the nepenthe that had been
                     imbibed and the presence of death which does not nearly concern us, were of a
                     nature to produce.
                  It is a not uninteresting study, the effect that such a scene has upon
                     different temperaments—the effect that the deaths of our different friends have
                     upon each individually. In the present case the scene was so much at conflict
                     with all past associations and ideas—such reflections had been so often
                     banished, or only casually alluded to, that it was almost impossible for the
                     company assembled to keep the present uppermost in their thoughts, and not
                     allow the conversation to wander unchecked altogether.
                  It was not a reflection I had leisure to make at the moment, as I passed on
                     immediately to my uncle's chamber. What was occupying my mind at the time was
                     that I, who was his nearest relative, was the last person in the world
                     qualified to administer any consolation at his departure from the world.
                  M. Ugalde had never been much occupied with my welfare, but he had nearly
                     always allowed me to do as I pleased. He had rarely listened to anything that
                     had interested me, but he had not greatly thwarted my whims. Considering how
                     often we are made miserable by the active interference of friends, and not
                     unfrequently by their interest in our affairs, I felt that I ought to be
                     grateful. He had virtually said to me to amuse myself with life—which, at the
                     best, was a farce—in what way I could. It was not his affair, whether I joined
                     in the follies of others or looked on from his standpoint of view.
                  Feeling that his nature had been shadowed by some blight, that I was about to
                     lose the only relative I had known, I could not fail of being impressed as I
                     passed into his darkened chamber.
                  For some time after my entrance, he did not appear to see me, and when he did
                     he regarded me with a steadfast gaze, without any attempt at speech, and with
                     an expression whose meaning I in vain sought to comprehend. Otherwise, the
                     features wore their usual reserved, fixed expression. There was no gasping, or
                     faltering in his voice when he finally spoke, no restless movement of the
                     limbs. Thus seeing him, tranquil and with no appearance of pain, it was
                     difficult to realize that he stood upon the threshold of death.
                  I learned afterwards that the composed state in which I found him, had been
                     produced by opiates, upon the use of which he had insisted, contrary to the
                     advice of his doctor. His disease had been brought on by an indigestion, and
                     once prostrated he had shown himself much less indifferent to the approach of
                     death than to the disturbance in his life produced by pain, it was difficult to
                     refrain from such language as a deathbed would naturally inspire, although it
                     was evident he wished to avoid the subject.
                  
                  "I know, uncle," said I, "you have distrusted all manifestations of gratitude,
                     but if I could give you the elixir of life by shortening my days, it should be
                     yours."
                  In the mood in which I was in, what I said was the truth.
                  "What you are telling me now may or may not be true," he said, very slowly,
                     "but it never was a matter of any consequence, least of all now. I have done
                     nothing for you but allow you a certain sum of money. It is false feeling to be
                     grateful, if you will have it so, for anything more. My judgments have not been
                     infallible; if I gave you any advice it would as soon be forgotten as
                     myself.
               
               
                  Philosophy.
                  "You have a fortune before you to dispose as you prefer, and fortunes dwarf and
                     demoralize natures of small ambition. I am not certain that I ought not rather
                     to bestow an imprecation than my wealth. What you will inherit will be a
                     burthen under which your talents and energies will have to stagger. You will
                     not naturally put forth your best exertions for a small remuneration when your
                     bank notes accumulate as fast as you can scatter them.
                  "But now that you have been raised to a life of ease and will soon have wealth
                     in your possession, endeavor at every sacrifice to preserve it. What the world
                     calls crime is a lack as often as not of judgment, or is brought on by
                     misfortune. Any sudden change from one condition in life to another is
                     dangerous to principle, if you have any, and if you become poor it is but one
                     step to stealing. Families of former wealth that become impoverished, for this
                     reason, not unfrequently bequeath their names to gamblers and prostitutes.
                     Wealth will not always procure pleasure, but it will protect against some of
                     the ills of life. But happiness is dependent upon others as much as upon
                     ourselves. It never lasts long in one condition or the other. We look forward
                     when we are young, and sigh for youth when we are old. What will satisfy at one
                     time will not at another. Occupy yourself with any of the duties, honors, or
                     various 
                        relalations
                        relations
                      of life, and you will arrive at my conclusions in the end.
                  "To give any advice to one at your age would be a warning against the dangers
                     to be met from the other sex. It is a matter of calculation with every woman
                     that understands her business to make us mad. She involves the happiness of
                     every man whose love she secures. If you are unsuccessful, you dissipate your
                     fortune. If you succeed, she assists you in doing so. Be satisfied with a
                     matter of fact companion if you can; a fascinating wife will never be satisfied
                     with you or any one else. The chances of winning are not sufficient to
                     overbalance the risk to which you expose your happiness."
                  His last advice did not surprise me. I had never seen a lady enter his house,
                     and he could not bear to have one near him. When he spoke of woman at all it
                     was generally with the intimation that they were in every way man's inferior,
                     and only excelled in such branches as had been contemptuously abandoned to
                     their skill.
                  But while concluding what he had to tell me, by mentioning the friends whom he
                     wished to appear at his funeral, and providing that they should be entertained
                     as usual; while bequeathing a legacy to Mr. Bruno, to the restaurateur with
                     whom he had been accustomed to dine, and to Francois, his old attendant—the
                     latter himself entered, and announced in a low tone that M'lle Marie was in
                     attendance, and begged to be allowed to see him before his death.
                  Her own health had long been broken, and her life was only a question of time.
                     While passing in a carriage she had been shocked by the funereal appearance or
                     the house—by the almost visible atmosphere of death. Her agitated inquiries and
                     demand for admission, which scarcely admitted refusal, had been the result. M.
                     Ugalde's lace, at mention of the name, became agitated and convulsed with more
                     feeling than I had ever before seen it. It was very evident that the secret
                     wish of his soul was to see the applicant.
                  "I have been struggling all of my life," he said, "for the triumph of intellect
                     over impulse. It costs me as great a struggle now as it did the first time I
                     ever made feeling bend to pride."
                  "Shall Madame be admitted?" inquired Francois.
                  "No," he said with a tremulous voice; "tell her to remember me as she saw me
                     years ago. I am too near being a corpse to have to play a living role with
                     credit."
                  Before Francois could execute his errand, the door of the apartment swung
                     slowly open. The veiled figure of a woman dressed in black, shadowy and
                     evanescent, now entered, and it did not need that I should be afterwards told
                     who it was—that it was the Marie to whom my uncle had been many years
                     previously engaged.
                  As she approached and kneeled at his bedside, the tragic light which I had
                     never seen absent from his eyes suddenly gave way to a look of happiness and
                     ecstacy, and the weight of years and of approaching death seemed to be shaken
                     off. The flame from the expiring taper shot up from the socket for a moment—for
                     a brief moment. "Clasp my hand once more, Marie—once more. It seems, after all,
                     that I am to die in your arms. If I had long ago believed you capable of this
                     we never would have separated. We never get what we want, or if it comes at all
                     it comes when we have ceased to care for it."
                  It was the last sentiment, good or bad, that he ever uttered. When we went to
                     arrange his pillows it was found that the two existences which through life had
                     flown apart and refused to mix had now united in their flight for the pale
                     realm of shadows.
               
            
            
               THE ADVENTURES OF A NIGHT.
               
                  In my twentieth year I discovered a conspiracy among my nearest relations to
                     deprive me of my freedom. Their plan was nothing less than to marry me to the
                     daughter of an old family friend and neighbor—to a young girl, good-looking and
                     intelligent enough, but who at the same time was not at all to my taste, and to
                     whom in fact I had acquired an almost positive aversion. Besides, I naturally
                     concluded I was too young to get married—that is, I had seen but little of the
                     world. Before settling down it was necessary to go forth and meet with some of
                     the charming adventures with which romancers are perpetually burthening their
                     pages. That would be a stupid sort of marriage, indeed, where you would be
                     given away to a young creature who might or might not be good looking or
                     lovable, who had made no impression one way or the other. I could, in fact,
                     scarcely say that I had seen her. My proper line of action was of course to go
                     forth and meet with adventures—to discover that one lively and agreeable
                     incident led on to another—to a charming rencounter here—to a formal
                     presentation a little further on, and to a quarrel and difficulty with a wicked
                     and maliciously-disposed rival, who would threaten to kill me, but which
                     difficulty would end, if necessary with my marriage, or by killing him.
                  Under such circumstances any serious proposal to marry the daughter of an old
                     neighbor was simply ridiculous. The more so too as my education was scarcely
                     completed.
                  In those days I had been going to school with a youth of the same age as
                     myself, at what was known as the Two-Sexes Institute. One or two such schools
                     are still in existence, though they never became popular, and the name in the
                     precise case to which I refer was almost a misnomer.
                  My friend and classmate, who subsequently became celebrated as a bambocheur and a young man about town, was called
                     Hypolite.
                  It was in accordance with his suggestion and advice that I had rejected the
                     overtures of my friends and had determined to see what there was in life before
                     listening to any propositions about settling down into a quiet, easy-going
                     existence.
                  Monsieur Baudoin, the head of the school in which we were both placed, was a
                     little bald-headed gentleman, with protruding eyes, who had come to this
                     country as a gardener. Matters not prospering with him in this capacity, he had
                     contracted a marriage with a well known milliner, and tradition represented
                     that the institution which he now had under his control had been given him as a
                     bonus, upon the completion of the marriage by some one who had previously been
                     the cher ami of the lady in question. The
                     world had looked at first coldly on the institution of Baudoin, after its
                     commencement; but in process of time, it came to be discovered that his
                     grounds—for he was a gardener—looked as blooming as the garden of the
                     Hesperides, and that the female pupils of madame dressed with more taste and
                     fashion than the eleves of any similar
                     institution in the city.
                  Neither of the heads of the school interfered actively in our studies; these
                     being confided to subordinate teachers, who deserved the credit of what
                     progress we made (if any) in our studies.
                  Madame we never saw, except en the streets, riding or promenading very gaily
                     dressed; while Monsieur, her husband, jogged through life contentedly enough,
                     snipping and clipping at his shrubbery, and making bouquets for his patrons,
                     and favorite female pupils. Engaged in this occupation, we were allowed to
                     admire him at a distance, but in no wise approach or disturb; and any attempt
                     to trouble his intellect with questions connected with our studies, would be
                     visited heavily, not only upon our own heads, but those of our unfortunate
                     teachers.
                  The success of the institution was undoubtedly due to a certain piquancy of
                     manner upon the part of Madame, which pleased and a certain assumption of
                     superiority which had awakened dread. As a milliner she had possessed the power
                     of making visitors purchase against their judgment, by an air which said, 'If
                     you do not buy you are lacking in taste, or are from the country'—an argument
                     which few visitors who had not already ruined their guardians or husbands in
                     acquiring the necessary experience, could resist. This power, which books
                     failed to teach, had to a great extent sustained the reputation of the
                     school.
                  Mme. Baudoin, the ex-modiste, was the head centre of the institution which bore
                     her husband's name. She knew little of books, but contrived to keep her
                     establishment in order; a daughter, on the other hand, called Ernestine, was an
                     excellent teacher, while M. Baudoin was too much interested in ornamental
                     gardening to be of much in-door use in one capacity or the other.
                  The only trouble about Ernestine, who sometimes accepted a situation as
                     governess, and was in every way to be trusted, was that her complexion was so
                     unmistakably brunette as to be sometimes embarrassing not only to herself but
                     escort. At one time it involved the cowhiding of a restaurateur, who declined
                     to receive the orders of herself and party. At another time it led to a more
                     gentlemanly affray, in which her uncle, who kept a pistol gallery, acted as
                     principal, and proved the accuracy of his weapons. On still another occasion
                     she was engaged to a suitor who carried his devotion to such an extremity as to
                     insult half of his male friends on her account. He finally succumbed, however,
                     to his enthusiasm, and the visitor to the old St. Louis Cemetery may still see
                     inscribed upon his tomb, 'Victime de
                        l'honneur.'
                  
                  "In this state of affairs I was one evening surprised by Hypolite's bursting
                     into my room, dressed as an Indian, and painted to such an extent in the
                     warwhoop style as almost to defy recognition.
                  "'What do you mean by pouring over a book all alone to-day,' he 
                        noisely
                        noisily
                      inquired. 'Or do you forget the ball to-night?'
                  "True; I had forgotten it. And so you are among the masqueraders?"
                  "And to-night you must go with me. Throw away your books, and quit all that
                     foolishness. On s'amuse. Ernestine and
                     Gabrielle have tickets to the opera ball, and they wish us to go along with
                     them."
                  "But in the first place will Mme. Baudoin consent?"
                  "We have not thought it worth the trouble of asking her. She consents to
                     everything that Gabrielle demands. Besides the latter is soon to leave the
                     school, and naturally does what she pleases."
                  "In the second place, who is Gabrielle?"
                  "Do you not know? She is Madame's wildest eleve. You have no idea what a young colt she is, or was—for she
                     is getting better now. But the first week she came here she slapped Madame's
                     own face and actually ran away from school, went on board of one of the boats,
                     and would have gone home by herself if she had not been recaptured. It may have
                     been the influence of the family, or perhaps a desire on Madame Baudoin's part
                     to tame her; but everybody wondered why she was not expelled long since. If
                     half what the other girls and the servants say is true, she must be the biggest
                     devil in the world."
                  "But have you ever seen her? The boys are not usually allowed to enter the
                     portion of the building which is occupied by the girls."
                  "It was through Ernestine. She is Ernestine's favorite pupil, though she never
                     does anything but look out of the windows or over the porticoes, or play and
                     slug a little at the piano. But you ought to see her—the most beautiful,
                     indolent, restless girl you ever put your eyes on. She is the tyrant of the
                     household. She believes everything you tell her, and will cry or affect to cry
                     at any story of suffering. But, en revanche,
                     you have no idea what a temper she has. The other day she broke a chair to
                     pieces, and set to work with it upon one of the servants who had been
                     impertinent to her. Another time she drank too much punch, and was so sick all
                     the next day as to disturb the order of the school. But to come back to where
                     we started. Will you go with us to-night? You may act as her cavalier, if you
                     will."
                  "No, I do not care to go; I do not think I would like your new friend, as you
                     describe her."
                  But Hypolite was saved the trouble of making a farther appeal by the sudden
                     entrance of Gabrielle herself. Her appearance was eminently neglige. She was attired in a faded, waistless
                     sack, which, with the powder she wore upon her face, gave her the appearance of
                     imprisoning her sylph-like form in a sack made to contain meal. The half-open
                     door through which she had entered revealed so many skirts scattered about the
                     floor that you were led to suspect that her little figure was minus of the
                     ordinary number. Her face, as Hypolite had said, was in the highest degree
                     striking, and with her long hair streaming down her shoulders and back, and
                     which she appeared to have been just in the act of combing, you almost forgot
                     the sloven in the picture she presented.
                  "Has Hypolite asked you to go to the ball with us to-night?" said she to me
                     without awaiting any introduction.
                  Before I could reply, the voice of Ernestine was heard from the room which she
                     had just left.
                  "Will you come along, Gabrielle; I must commence dressing too, and I cannot
                     waste all day with your hair."
                  "Wait one moment Ernestine. Lace my bottine, Hypolite, while I talk to this
                     imbecile. I can see that he wishes to make out that he does not want to go with
                     us."
                  Hypolite meanwhile bent upon one knee and with the air of a black-smith shoeing
                     a horse, set to work at his appointed task.
                  I blushingly commenced to make some excuses, but she interrupted me.
                  "What young: man," said she, glancing over 
                        he
                        her
                      shoulder at me, "with any life and spirit, will be able to stay away.
                     Everybody goes to balls on Mardi-Gras night and you will be only making
                     yourself ridiculous by not doing as everyone else does."
                  As she said this she freed her foot from Hypolite's hands, and whistling a
                     cachuca and moving her arms as if playing upon castanets, she danced gaily out
                     of the room.
                  "Are you going to go with us?" she stopped at the door to inquire.
                  "But I have never been to a ball of this or any other kind, and I shall be of
                     no assistance."
                  "There never was a better time," said she, "to commence. You will meet there a
                     crowd of delighted spirits, whom you have never seen before, and do not, expect
                     to meet again—but with whom you dance, and gallop with an elan—a gusto and
                     a laiser-aller, which knows no bounds in such
                     a crowd. You will pass your time more charmingly than if you had been old
                     friends all of your life."
                  "And lastly," added Hypolite, "the numerous lights, the reflecting mirrors, the
                     music, the gay and ornamented throng, will awake you to an ecstacy felt rarely
                     in a lifetime."
                  "Say no more," I added. "You make me curious to experience this delirium and
                     intoxication which, if one is to believe you, is equal to that of the blest in
                     Heaven."
                  "In that case," said Hypolite, "It will be necessary that you at once secure a
                     costume. There is a magnificent Figaro suit at Mme. Groux, which I have asked
                     that veteran costumiere to hold in reserve.
                     It will be for you just the character. Au
                        revoir Gabrielle, we will return for you early." And kissing the
                     tips of his fingers and making an impressive bow, first with one side of his
                     head, and then the other, he backed himself out of the door.
                  Hypolite's costume I soon discovered was in keeping with the scene out of
                     doors. The carnival spirit was in full blast. Singular figures were moving
                     about on foot or clattering by on horseback or in vehicles. Sometimes a dozen
                     wild characters of both sexes would be crowded into one carriage, and in spite
                     of the fantastic costume the driver would be forced to wear, his business air
                     would be discovered beneath his paint, and stand in singular contrast to the
                     mad hilarity to the remainder of the party. The social status of those who
                     masqueraded in daylight was not what it was in former days; first, men and
                     faster women lent it the most generous support; but what was lacking in
                     respectability, was made up in drinking and boisterous merriment.
                  What was your first observation was the extraordinary tendency the female
                     masqueraders had to rush into male apparel. At least one-half of them were so
                     disguised, while those who were debarred from appearing as cavaliers took their
                     revenge by curtailing their skirts, and in the 
                        paradisaical
                        paradisiacal
                      shortness of their attire left the ballet-dancers but little behind.
                     About dark, a society of masqueraders, composed, it was supposed, of some of
                     the best known men of the city (for none of the members were positively known),
                     made their appearance in procession. The Mrs. Grundys who had kept their
                     daughters within doors during the day from fear of the revelers, who would have
                     hesitated little at accosting them or lifting their veils, could now no longer
                     restrain their curiosity, and between the maskers and the lookers on it became
                     impossible to proceed.
                  The passage of this procession, some several hundred strong, in chariots, and
                     representing the mythological age, closed the outdoor amusements. The air grew
                     cooler; the baboons, monkeys and devils, unsustained by the consolations of
                     liquor, became less sportive; the musical instruments, which were held in the
                     hands of low-necked sirens, emitted no sounds of harmony, and even the wildest
                     of the bambocheurs showed signs of letting
                     down.
                  "The day's performance is over," said Camille in my ear. "Let us get your
                     costume and report to our friends."
                  I followed his suggestion. The white-haired matron who had made costumes all of
                     her life, recognized by a smile one of her best customers, and at Hypolite's
                     request had soon unhooked with a pole the disguise which he pointed out.
                  Having experience about the matter, and the costume being a very pretty one in
                     purple velvet, I yielded to Hypolite's representations, and lost no time in
                     arranging myself in it. This task accomplished, we hastened back to the
                        pension for Ernestine and Gabrielle. The
                     latter kept us sometime waiting, but when she at length made her appearance, I
                     was obliged to admit that her costume  ow made up in
                     brilliancy for any little negligence I might have before observed. Still she
                     was not the kind of girl I thought I could have ever fancied, and thinking that
                     Hypolite, from the manner in which he had spoken of her, might be more amiably
                     inclined, I offered my arm to Ernestine, and resigned to him the fairer
                     prize.
                  Our party had reached the door of the Opera House. A long line of carriages
                     hinted that we would not find ourselves alone. The first part of the evening,
                     there was to be represented a spectacle gotten up by a masquerading club, which
                     had been eagerly expected for a long time previous, and large sums of money had
                     in some cases been offered to procure tickets. As it was known before hand that
                     the number of invited guests would be immense, both banquettes in front of the
                     main entrance before the opening of the doors were crowded with ladies in
                     diamonds and ball dresses, and so great was the throng that snowy slippers were
                     forced sometimes to come in contact with the mud of the street. From the
                     compression of skirts, the damage to tulle and the
                     unavoidable pushing and pressing of such a crowd, more than one Niobe was
                     reduced to a melting mood, and I had particular occasion to remark a young
                     lady, whose head was forced against my bosom, from the absolute impossibility
                     on account of the crowd, of turning it any other way, and who moistened in this
                     manner my embroidered shirt sufficiently to alarm me for its effect.
                  But the doors were at length opened, the crowd gained seats, the ladies in the
                     first and second floor stalls and open boxes, the gentlemen in the upper
                     galleries, and now the performance began.
                  Hypolite was not of an age or temperament to be greatly interested, or to allow
                     me to believe so, in the allegorical tableaux of the arts and seasons, when so
                     dazzling an array of beauty formed a more alluring spectacle; and fearful of
                     missing the sight of some pretty face, he was constantly moving from one
                     portion of the building to the other. At one moment he was about the entrance
                     of the dress circle; at another he would penetrate, with lorgnette in hand, to
                     the paradise or uppermost tier and look down from that supreme elevation upon
                     the magnificent sight below.
                  When he had reached the latter height, "Let us," said he, "consume the interim
                     between this and the dancing portion of the evening in discussing some of the
                     characters which we can still see from this serene elevation. Dancing, after
                     all, which is work, is associated with the sweat of the brow, should be
                     preceded by rest."
                  He now rolled a couple of cigaretes and then commenced discoursing with the air
                     of a Diable Boileux about many of the
                     personages whom he saw.
               
               
                  A Coup d'Œil from the Dress Circle.
                  We had reached what was to be the scene of the evening's festivities, and
                     Hypolite and I, while awaiting the reappearance of our party from the dressing
                     room discoursed of the guests we saw below.
                  "The great staple of the invited guests you see below is a fair representation
                     of the respectability, and almost of the fashion of the city. Either through
                     the influence of friends, or for some other reason difficult to explain, there
                     are, and, perhaps, always will be some exceptions to the rule. When the
                     tableaux are over, the haut ton will leave or
                     remain in the loges, and another stratum of a lower formation, and who have
                     invitations for only that part of the evening's amusements, will be allowed to
                     enter."
                  "But tell me, Hypolite, now that you have brought me here, who are some of the
                     principal characters we see to-night? You know everybody, or affect to know
                     everybody. You may commence with the young lady who has on the pretty but
                     bizarre costume, and who seems to be acting the role of Le chat Botte."
                  "Who is she? That is the daughter of Madame ——, another costumiere, who keeps for the amusement of the public, a magasin of masquerade costumes. She dresses well,
                     and cheaply, too, though her social position is not high."
                  "The family of Mlle. Sophie, (for that is her name,) have had their history in
                     their day. Her father was one of the noblesse who emigrated at the time of the
                     French revolution, and who tried to establish in this
                     country the fortune he had lost in the old. But fortunes which pass away seldom
                     return, and the family in the second generation were poorer than in the first.
                     At the death of the emigre he left his son
                     nothing to remind him of his father's estate, except a magnificent sword, which
                     had more than once been worn in the presence of royalty. Can you guess what
                     became of this heirloom which had survived the loss of every other relic? The
                     son was reduced to earn his living as a cobbler, and the sword was deliberately
                     broken into shoemaker's knives. With these he for a long time did his work
                     toward honorably supporting his family—he may be doing so yet."
                  "If I dance at all, it shall be with M'lle Sophie for one of my partners. Now
                     for the rest."
                  "The party, for instance, who is just passing beneath, has had her name in the
                        Chronique Scandaleus for several years. How she obtains
                     entrance into society and keeps from obtaining it in a criminal court, is
                     difficult to be seen. She is pretty, her relatives deservedly rank high, and
                     will probably obtain admission for her into one or two assembled more.
                  "But if you wish to witness a sight, notice the manner in which her unexpected
                     presence is greeted by others of her sex."
                  I followed his eyes, and sure enough, such silent rearing of crests, when she
                     was recognized nized by old
                     acquaintances, I have never before or since witnessed.
                  As the various arrivals passed her in entering the room, each lady bestowed
                     upon her a broadside, like that of a besieging squadron, and welcomed her in
                     the manner in which the ghosts of Richard's victims amused that badly-resting
                     monarch.
                  The sinner who follows her in the procession is still worse. That is the
                     latter's husband, with the honest, melancholy expression of countenance, whom
                     you see is now gazing wistfully at her from the opposite side of the room, and
                     who seems to be the only party present who is ignorant of his wife's
                     character.
                  "The couple who are just entering the room only differ from the preceding in
                     that they exactly resemble each other, (arcades
                        ambo) and in that they are mutually aware of it. While acting with
                     the utmost frankness in their mutual 
                        pecadilloes
                        peccadilloes
                     , they yet maintain a certain reserve toward society, and no one who
                     now sees them would, suppose them other than mature lovers. Amiable the
                     gentleman certainly is, and 'tis said that once, having surprised a gallant in
                     paying a doubtful compliment to his lady, his only response was to gaily warn
                     the offender not to be indiscreet in the presence of the husband."
                  "You shall tell me no more, mon ami; save
                     your worthless scandal, and let me believe there is still some honesty and
                     honor in life. You have pointed out two or three who are perhaps old offenders,
                     but you have offered no tribute to the hundreds who are pure and worthy."
                  "The good, like nations who enjoy prosperity, have no history."
                  Meanwhile, the dancing had commenced, and amorous youth was trundling
                     languishing beauty up and down the room to music which permitted of no rest. We
                     hastened below, and, in spite of my want of familiarity with the scene, I made
                     bold to offer my services to Gabrielle. I was not badly rewarded for my
                     attention, as she, as I had afterwards occasion to know, was in reality one of
                     the best dancers in the room. She had the quick eye which frequenters of very
                     crowded ball-rooms acquire for discovering good manœuvering-ground—spots upon
                     the crowded floor, upon which you could turn, or zigzag bypaths of escape.
                  It was a sight to see her, with her head turned slightly to one side, dancing
                     for two or three moments in some isolated spot, like a leaf in a stream of
                     water whirling momentarily in an eddy, and then gliding swiftly down the main
                     current. Now she would whisper, "Plus vite mon
                        cher, those stupid musicians are always too slow with their
                     music," and then we would dance like so many bacchantes, with a 
                        vehemance
                        vehemence
                      and a rapidity which would leave her partner breathed and exhausted,
                     but which would scarcely suffuse her face with color. When the musicians, from
                     exhaustion would cease to blow. "Ah," she would sigh. "Quel plaisir! C'est dommage que ce soit si court." A regret that
                     your loss of health would prevent you from replying to or sharing.
                  "But Gabrielle did not come to the grandest ball of the season to dance the
                     whole evening with me whom she saw every day, and from want of experience I did
                     not possess the requisite address to secure elsewhere partners. Partly, too, it
                     was a lack of the buoyant temperament, which is necessary to an occasion of
                     this sort. At any rate, I soon became affected by the feeling or address which
                     was naturally inspired by the strangeness to me of the scene, by the light of
                     so much mirth around which I was prevented by my want of acquaintance from
                     enjoying the youth who throng the staircases, doors and entryways on such an
                     occasion, and who seem satisfied with having paid their entrance fee, with
                     putting on and taking off their gloves, lounging about the corners and basking
                     in a harmless way in the charms which lay just beyond, are, of all
                     pleasure-seekers, the least to be envied; and the wallflowers who are condemned
                     to repine in their seats at the happiness which is so near and yet so far, are
                     deserving of much more sympathy than is generally accorded.
                  Ernestine did not dance, and Hypolite had not been so fortunate as I, in his
                     partner. He had encountered a stout lady with a waist he described as
                     resembling a cistern, and his unhappy destiny had compelled him, while the
                     music lasted, to wheel her in circles around the hall. More than once I had
                     passed him, his face violently 
                        discolered
                        discolored
                      with his fierce exercise, and his breathing heard above the blast of
                     the trombones.
                  There were some dozen bambocheurs in every
                     species of fantastic costume, who were in the wildest possible spirits, and who
                     were in at constant whirl, with partners as lively and as rapid as themselves.
                     A vivandiere, with red cap and tasseled
                     boots, was coquetting, with a solemn-faced pardon. Psyche hung upon the arm of
                     a Turk, and the red man of the forest pressed to his bosom, in the waltz, the
                     daughter of the pale face. A mad wag, in a pine-apple suit, was meanwhile
                     having his own fun by romping around the room with a half a dozen children at
                     his heels, or interrupting tender tetes-a-tetes by dodging behind and catching
                     hold of absent-minded lovers. While the band was feasting in the eating room,
                     he favored the assembly with solos on the trombone, or danced jigs to the music
                     of the drum.
                  But the scene generally did not strike you in a ludicrous point of view. There
                     was a glare, a glitter, an elan and
                     atmosphere of coquetry which made you lose the perception of the absurd, and
                     yield to the excitement which reigned paramount.
                  While thus looking on at this self-occupied crowd of amazons, peasants,
                     princesses, and captivating figures in every variety of coquettish dress, I was
                     surprised by a light touch upon my shoulder.
                  Upon turning, I saw standing behind me a zephyr-like figure, in half-mask, clad
                     in a gossamer dress that rather shaded than concealed her form and rounded
                     limbs. Upon her shoulders she bore golden butterfly wings. So irresistibly did
                     her attitude and air impress me, as she stood softly leaning forward to whisper
                     in my ear, that for a moment I thought her some supernatural exhalation.
               
               
                  The Black Domino.
                  The conversation followed that occurs at every masked ball—made up mostly of
                     pantomime, of abrupt questions and direct answers, and which, in most cases,
                     was tipped with overdrawn compliment or downright malice. One never talks to a
                     masked figure as he does to any other companion. The most ordinary mask
                     somewhat appeals to the imagination.
                  "Why are you alone?" she asked.
                  "I came to have adventures, and no one appears to see me."
                  "Are you naturally dull?"
                  "I moralize because there is no temptation—no chance to be indiscreet. Who are
                     you?"
                  "I am Psyche—the Soul. My butterfly wings—I don't know why—mean
                     immortality."
                  "And you have flown to the Heaven of the dress circle—"
                  "As a benevolent divinity—to cure you of your stupidity, to give you
                     adventures."
                  "And that means that you wish to dance?"
                  "Goddesses do not dance with every presumptuous youth. Are your gloves
                     clean?"
                  "I put on a fresh pair—"
                  "Never mind—only be careful of my wings."
                  Her head was against my shoulder. I was as happy with the music of the waltz as
                     if I had really held a goddess in my arms.
                  "You are holding me too close."
                  "I was afraid that I was dreaming. I dreaded that Psyche might interrupt my
                     dream of happiness to fly away."
                  "Your compliments are not amusing. I will not dance with you any more."
                  "Do you say that because the band has ceased?"
                  "No, my friends are calling me. Do you not observe that they appear annoyed at
                     seeing me in your company."
                  "Tell me who the gentleman is with the Ionic order of moustaches, who is
                     regarding you wistfully from the door. Your friend looks to me like a well
                     dressed adventurer."
                  "A friend more amusing than you."
                  She was moving away.
                  "Shall I see you again?"
                  "Perhaps, but in another costume—plain white domino."
                  She was gone.
                  The rooms now had but little charm for me. I could only promenade from one part
                     to the other, and curse the delay that separated us. At length, after having
                     vainly sought for twenty times the form I missed in every quarter, I saw a mask
                     issue from the dressing room, which answered to the given description.
                  I insisted upon accosting it—upon identifying it as some one I had known, and
                     of spending recklessly a large amount with it in the supper room. An elderly
                     chaperone at this stage joined us. The mask finally proved to be only
                     Gabrielle. The elderly chaperone to be Mme. Baudoin.
                  "You are very pretty, Miss Gabrielle, and you never seemed prettier than
                     to-night; but the fact is you see that I have mistaken you for somebody else. I
                     thought I was about commencing an adventure."
                  "You insist so much on neglecting me, I am obliged to take care of myself. But
                     finish your romance. Only it will cost you something to find your unknown
                     unless you have better eyes with others than you have had with me."
                  She was soon lost in the throng.
                  I wandered in another direction and sighed to encounter Hypolite. Here, at
                     least I thought, was a spirit who understood how to bend circumstances and to
                     convert every acquaintance into an amusing companion—to roder from one fair flower to another—to dance with a can-cannesque freedom of movement all night long.
                     Judging from his appearance, when I now encountered him, he had given his
                     disposition full swing. He had paused in his Terpsichorean labors for
                     supper.
                  "You are doubtless meeting with a great deal of romance—a great deal of
                     happiness, Hypolite?"
                  "Oh don't trouble yourself about me. Do you see that brunette with the
                     almond-shaped eyes, who is all the time looking at us over her partner's
                     shoulder while dancing?"
                  "Do you mean the one with the Spanish cast of features?"
                  "Yes, that is the one. She is really Spanish; that is to say, I hear that she
                     has recently come over from Cuba. I flatter myself that I am regarded in the
                     most amiable light in that quarter."
                  "How? Do you speak Spanish among your other accomplishments? or does she
                     converse in English?"
                  "Au contraire. She does not understand a word
                     of English, and I no more of Spanish. We have to talk altogether the language
                     of love, which is independent of words. We squeeze each other's hands, yes,
                     which really is much pleasanter at a ball."
                  "Rather a limited flirtation. But how did you acquire so charming an
                     acquaintance?"
                  "I met here a friend who had her in charge, and who asked me if I did not wish
                     to get introduced to the wittiest and most spirituelle lady in the room.
                  "When I said yes, he introduced me to her. Imagine my astonishment when we
                     mutually discovered that we could not understand each other—that is, by words.
                     I was about to retire, when the band struck up. We danced, of course. There was
                     so much poetry of motion in her every movement that I have since scarcely been
                     able to tear myself away for a moment to find out who she is."
                  "And you have succeeded?"
                  "Yes. As I have told you, she comes from Cuba, or, at any rate, appears to be
                     under the care of that bilious, pock-marked senor, who is seated just opposite.
                     You must have heard of that little affair, in which a Cuban Don"—
                  "Perhaps—but imagine that I know all about it, and instead of telling the
                     story. point out her cavalier."
                  "Do you see the man with the large, heavy figure, and who is dressed to
                     represent Mephistophiles?"
                  "The one whose face is smeared with paint, and who really looks likes a devil
                     incarnate?"
                  "Why that is the one who must accompany Psyche."
                  "And who is Psyche?"
                  "I have discovered her at last—she has just taken his arm."
                  "And you tell me you know her? That must be charming."
                  "While pursuing our separate adventures you have accidentally met with the
                     sister of the lady with whom I have been dancing."
                  "You say that Psyche is a sister to your inamorata?"
                  "Yes, and consequently must be the wife, as you would have understood if you
                     had listened, of Mephistophiles."
                  "Nonsense. I will not believe it."
                  The couple, meanwhile, of whom we spoke had promenaded around the room. When
                     they had reached the place where we were standing, Psyche released the arm of
                     her cavalier and took mine. I felt flattered at the compliment, but sighed to
                     think of what Hypolite had just told me.
                  "And you sigh?" she inquired.
                  "Tell me, is it possible that Mephistophiles is your husband?"
                  "No—not yet."
                  "That is bad; that is, if he is to be your husband at all."
                  "And you are not pleased. Why?"
                  "I am in love. There is now no hope. I would have given—"
                  "What would you have given?"
                  "If your Mephistophiles were really the devil, as he looks savage and ferocious
                     enough to be, I should have been willing to struggle with him for such a
                     prize."
                  "You would be willing, then, to fight him to obtain me. But you are very
                     brave!"
                  "But such a prize—"
                  "Possibly you may win."
                  Before she could say more, Mephistophiles stalked to where we were, and with a
                     scowl ended the conversation by carrying her off. His fierce look did not seem
                     to me part of his costume.
               
               
                  Finale.
                  And now the night had waned, the roses had faded upon the dress and in the
                     cheeks of beauty, and the dance was is still progressing with the most outrageous intensity. The damaged
                     reputations who had kept most in the background, were now brought prominently
                     forward, and the restless spirits who had been contented hitherto to keep
                     quiet, were becoming noisily turbulent and demonstrative. The music had gained
                     in swell and passion, but in the mood in which I was only caused wonderment;
                     that what with others urged on the dance, only awakened with me longing and
                     sadness.
                  In this mood as I stood near the entrance door, I was for the last time touched
                     upon the arm. It was the touch of Psyche, and she was having some altercation
                     with her escort.
                  I enquired what was the matter.
                  "The matter is," she said, "that I have attempted to disembarrass myself of
                     this gentleman's company. He insists on remaining."
                  Her cavalier, extravagantly dressed and painted, and who now seemed inflamed
                     with liquor, confirmed her statement by a gesture of entreaty that she should
                     go with him.
                  She glanced toward me a look of inquiry. She seemed at the moment in trouble,
                     and it needed no more, in my then humor, to make me consider her the most
                     beautiful woman in the world. Mephistophiles was looking excessively wicked and
                     dangerous. If he had looked twice as much so, I was infatuated enough to have
                     accepted the situation.
                  I strode in between him and Psyche, and peremptorily commanded him to keep
                     back.
                  "But, sir," said Psyche, "consult your strength. It is true that I have
                     renounced him for you, but you do not—"
                  "Say no more!" I exclaimed, maddened by the champagne, music and the situation.
                     "I intend to prove that your preference is not undeserved."
                  At this threat, Psyche's cavalier had become impatient. He had actually the
                     brutality to place his arm around her slender waist, and was in this manner
                     forcing her from the room. They had nearly reached the head of the stairs. I
                     was perhaps to deprived of the sight of the beautiful vision forever. At this
                     thought, undeterred by the straight shoot and almost perpendicular descent of
                     the steps, I had conceived the idea of throwing my rival headlong down these,
                     even at the risk of having to descend with him to the bottom. I was in fact in
                     the act of pushing Psyche rudely aside, and was meditating about catching
                     Mephistophiles by the hair or throat. She possibly read in my eye some such
                     wild idea as I made a movement forward. At any rate, I was not a little
                     astonished to find myself suddenly clasped by her arms instead of those of
                     Mephistophiles.
                  "Stay, madman! What is it you wish to do. Will you kill me, will you kill
                     yourself, and Mr. Baudoin?"
                  "But who are you?" I inquired, relaxing my hold, and struck by the now natural
                     tone of voice in which she spoke, and the familiar lineaments of the amateur
                     gardener.
                  "I am Gabrielle. I am the pupil of M'me Baudoin, and I am your cousin and
                        fiancee, you stupid idiot."
                  She placed her arm around my neck in such a coaxing way as to reduce me at once
                     to the most amiable of moods. My worst apprehensions were shown to be well
                     founded. There had been a conspiracy against me for depriving me of my freedom,
                     and my fiancee and the old head teacher had
                     been the principal actors.
                  "And this Cuban sylph, who Hypolite said was your sister?"
                  "That is one of Hypolite's stories."
                  "And Mephistophiles is not a Cuban Don?"
                  "No. Hypolite was either mistaken or imaginative."
                  "In that case, Belle Psyche, there is no cause of quarrel if you do not say no;
                     it shall not be my fault if my first adventure with your sex is not my
                     last."
                  She took my arm and moved homewards with a saucy look of acquiescence, but
                     which also intimated that I had but little to say about the matter.
                  As for Hypolite, I was revenged by subsequently learning that he had walked
                     home with his Cuban sylph, and that she proved to be Mme. Baudoin herself. And
                     so far was he from making captives of any of the heiresses or extraordinary
                     heroines with whom he had inflamed my imagination, that he soon united his to
                     the humble fortunes of the M'me Sophie of whom he had spoken to me in the early
                     part of the evening.
               
            
            
               THE BATTLE.
               
                  I.—THE FIRE-FLY DANCE.
                  The mere mention of a quiet evening spent with a few congenial friends will not
                     fully bring to mind the picture of repose now to be presented, even with the
                     addition of the details which ordinarily accompany such evenings. That is to
                     say the fireside circle in the present case was one of captivation and
                     intelligence, and was about evenly divided between the accomplished of both
                     sexes; composed on one side of officers held in the highest esteem in the army,
                     and who were snatching a moment's repose; and composed on the other hand of a
                     number of fair visitors and refugees from other States whose names would only
                     have to be mentioned to be recognized. Added to this there was the ruddy gleam
                     of a huge log-fire—there was the gathering around a supper table illuminated by
                     the steady glow of wax tapers. Lastly, to complete the picture, there was that
                     subdued and half-mysterious tone, as the evening advanced, which conversations
                     of an amiable and tender character naturally acquire. In doors the picture of
                     repose was hardly disturbed by even a glance or movement.
                  The scene without was of a less harmonious character. It was the last year of
                     the war.
                  Two hostile armies had been lying face to face with each other, for months.
                     During that time the thing had never been entirely interrupted. It was even at
                     that moment actually going on. The hospitable mansion, through whose windows a
                     ruddy light was now streaming, was not so far removed from the line but that
                     many of the operations incident to a siege were visible.
                  For instance, glancing through one of the windows, far in front, could be seen
                     a sort of circle of dancing lights, which might have suggested those of the
                     fire-fly or will o' the wisp; and which certainly, were the flashes produced by
                     the pickets as they kept up their desultory fire through the livelong night.
                     Occasionally, too, could be seen meteoric looking bodies slowly moving through
                     the air, and accompanied by a not unmusical sound. These, too, when they fell
                     would bury themselves at a great depth in the ground with a dull, heavy,
                     thudding sound, and an immense upraising of dust; but we get used to everything
                     in life—and on a quiet evening, when we have seen the same thing for months,
                     the sight excites scarcely any comment; no more indeed than would be occasioned
                     among the passengers of a magnificent steamship, at seeing the rolling of the
                     waves, or the plunging and sporting of the dolphins above and beneath their
                     surface.
                  The scene, therefore, as has been said, was, properly, one of repose. What was
                     out of doors at first glance, marred upon the picture, but in passing through
                     the windows of a room surrounded by every accompaniment of comfort and luxury,
                     it was toned down into the ordinary sights and sound of what was then every day
                     life. The thought awakened might have been compared to the slight chill which
                     one experiences in coming from a cold into a warm room. The fire-fly dance
                     without gave a faint flavor to what was within.
                  A careful spectator having made the foregoing observation would further have
                     remarked that the harmony and keeping of the occasion was preserved in the
                     character of the guests. A general survey would have shown him that the guests
                     were divided up into small groups. The last glance (supposing the observer to
                     have been gifted with fine insight into character) would have rested upon a
                     couple who were conversing upon a causeuse in
                     a quiet, almost stealthy manner, in a remote corner of the room, and who,
                     altogether, were its least demonstrative occupants.
                  It is of these two figures (for I upon the occasion referred to had nothing
                     else to do but play the role of the observer) that the rest of the story will
                     be principally occupied. I had in the first place remarked that the lady had
                     been one of the last inmates of the house to enter the drawing room. Her
                     movements in entering were noiseless—almost stealthy. Something in her manner
                     was suggestive of inferior position, loss of worldly wealth, or other social
                     misfortune, from a certain repressed air, and want of interest in the scene.
                     Her face, in spite of unusual beauty, and which would otherwise have attracted,
                     indicated some familiarity with trouble—some meditation upon the vexed
                     questions of life. It was the face of a charming woman, upon whom one could
                     detect a few shadows.
                  Shortly after the entrance of the latter, and after the arrival of the last of
                     the army visitors, an old friend of mine, and whom this reader may know by the
                     name of Jacinthe, had been announced. He attracted (I may mention par
                     parenthese that his rank was that of Captain) at his entrance very little
                     attention. He was known to but few men in the army; at that time intimately by
                     none.
                  In entering,I observed that he made a formal salute to the lady already
                     described, but took but little part (without any affectation of singularity) in
                     the conversation, either with her or any one else.
               
               
                  II—NEPENTHE.
                  One of the few accomplishments I possess is a moderate knowledge of
                     music—sufficient practice, for instance, to fill up the dull gaps that
                     sometimes, during an evening, occur in the conversation.
                  It was while thus engaged in contributing my small share to the general amusement that I
                     remarked that the two solitary figures of the evening were holding what to me
                     appeared solemn converse. The tone of the speakers, however, was very low,
                     their manners quiet and noiseless. One saw nothing but a mere drawing-room
                     attitude. Perhaps from mere force of suppression the air of being one of those
                     whose consequences last for a lifetime. Seated, at any rate, as I was near
                     them, it was difficult to produce any but soft, sensuous notes—to avoid making
                     the music correspond to the scene in the same way that in theatres the
                     orchestra hints, by way of undertone, at the coming denouement of the
                     melo-drama.
                  "Jocaste," I first heard the male speaker say, "your life, like that, perhaps,
                     of every one, contains a riddle. When I see your face, with its delicate
                     wax-like features, mobile and ideal in their character, it is difficult to
                     suppose that you possess any relentless purpose. It is not easy to imagine that
                     any deeper thought or passion has settled upon them than what concerns the mere
                     elegancies of life. Your face is almost without a shadow; your lips seem cleft
                     only for kisses. It is really very difficult to speak to you at all according
                     to reason; and, lastly, it is very hard to believe that your rosy smiles, your
                     affectation of languor and indolence mean only death for me."
                  "You commenced, Capt. Jacinthe, with an affectation of reserve. Why not
                     maintain it? These romantic speeches you must have remembered from Romeo, Claude Melnotte, Ingomar, or from some of the lovers of a generation
                     ago. You must think of something new, if you wish to amuse us in the world of
                     sentiment."
                  "If I do not speak to you passionately"—
                  "You are sometimes pensive, but never passionate. You do not love me—or at
                     least I have been loved so often that your words will never have the
                     stimulating effect of love upon my vanity. Your temperament would never please
                     a capricious woman."
                  "Dear Madam—."
                  "Omit the two first words—they are not necessary." 
                  "Will you not let me speak, when we have been so long separated—when we must so
                     soon part? Do you see through the window the rockets which have just sped high
                     into the air? As likely as not they mean that there will be
                     a military movement for the night or to-morrow."
                  "You make a sad spoken warrior. Take courage. Perhaps you will survive, if
                     there is a battle. But that ruddy glow on the horizon that appears to be at a
                     great distance—are those rockets, too?"
                  "No—it means, in addition, that an advance is being made, and that one side or
                     the other is burning up the stores that would otherwise be captured by the
                     opposite army."
                  "And you think that something is really about to happen?"
                  "Listen attentively and you can hear the dull, heavy tread of a brigade of men
                     moving outside over the frozen ground."
                  "It must be terrible to have to march upon such a night. Are you still
                     contented to be a soldier? Are you still patriotic or ambitious? Tell me how it
                     is that a man who is naturally a misanthrope"—
                  "And you mean me?"
                  "Yes, tell me how a man who has made a selfish calculation as to the value of
                     friendships, or who, rather, is indifferent to such ties, ever became
                     enthusiast enough to enlist at starting in the ranks?"
                  "You ought to know. Confess by your answer that you do know."
                  "Is it possible, as they tell me, that when you were last wounded you were
                     nursed by a young lady for two or three weeks, and were jealously kept out of
                     the sight of every female rival; and that finally, instead of being grateful,
                     you went off without telling her goodby? What makes you act so badly?"
                  "What makes you ask, when you already so well know? Listen! the drums are
                     beating the generale. Some of our party are already leaving. So would I be,
                     too, were I not a poor soldier. Have you, madam, no kind word before I go."
                  "My answer you know already. You have made your decision in life, and it has
                     affected mine. If you had decided right, perhaps I should have loved you—I do
                     not say no. Unfortunately you decided wrong, and—"
                  "On the contrary, I was only guilty in having a friend who ultimately proved to
                     be a successful rival. But it matters not about this—what happened
                        then.—what did you subsequently do, that must separate us now?
                     Are you indissolubly bound—are you married?"
                  "Possibly. Suffice it to state, Jacinthe, that you have decided wrong, so far
                     as we are both concerned."
                  "You wish to tell me then that, though you love me still, there is no
                     possibility of our ever hereafter meeting?"
                  "It is so obvious that there is no need of telling it."
                  Her companion gave the irresolute look of a man who scarcely knew what to
                     say.
                  "There are not many curious situations in life," he finally observed in the
                     tone of one who is endeavoring to content himself with a scrap of philosophy,
                     "there are not many situations more provocative of thought and feeling—that
                     have suggested more dramas and stories, calamitous and otherwise, than that of
                     a loving couple condemned to indifference and separation."
                  "Your reflection is true enough," said the lady addressed as Jocaste. "It might
                     also be added that in no other is a higher test for honor and character
                     afforded than that of a loving couple thus definitely shut out from all
                     hope."
                  "You then admit that you retain some of your former feeling?"
                  "Nothing of the sort. I was merely supposing a case."
                  "You will never be anything, Jocaste, but a coquette."
                  "Suppose then, if you choose, that the situation actually exists. It will give
                     you an opportunity of showing the highest order of heroism."
                  "Can you pronounce so readily the ban of separation? Look once more through the
                     window—the white tents have disappeared—the baggage wagons are driving rapidly
                     to the rear—the booming of cannon is heard—the whole army is now in
                     motion."
                  The lady thus addressed half unconsciously did as she was told, and appeared
                     for a moment lost in reverie. When she again spoke, the main subject seemed
                     momentarily forgotten, and her words showed the general tendency there was with
                     every one to make every conversation run into a commentary upon the great event
                     of the day.
                  "Poor Secessia," said she: "this will be her last battle. She should have had
                     some Waterloo before her final exhaustion, where she might have staked her
                     cause and definitely lost or won; where she might have sought victory or ruin
                     upon a cast of the die. Crippled in her limbs, emaciated by famine; and no
                     longer able to grasp in her hand the quivering spear, the tedious struggle has
                     nearly ended for her."
                  "And yet, when you see all this, will you not say at my departure one tender
                     word of adieu?"
                  The question appeared to be unheeded.
                  "How silently they march," said Jocaste; "beyond their trend there is scarcely
                     any other else—those old broken regiments have seen similar scenes before. One
                     might think at first, from the listless manner in which they carry their guns,
                     that they thought only of the happiness of obtaining a canteen of water to
                     drink or of resting by the way."
                  "It is as you say, somewhat different from the wild whoops and yells with which
                     the men went into the first battles of the war—the throwing away of coats and
                     baggage and the wild bravado of manner. Old soldiers, look now as if they know
                     what danger was, but that they know too how to endure it like men. But it will
                     not do to speak of this now—tell me what goodbye you can."
                  "I can only give you a discreet answer, and one shall be patriotic at the same
                     time. Every soldier that fights at all, should believe that he fights, for the
                     noblest cause that ever the trumpet proclaimed or was pleaded by the
                     sword."
                  Capt. Jacinthe gave the perplexed look of a man who wished to remain
                     conventional and discreet, and yet who was affected by an ungovernable impulse
                     to betray his feeling—to commit what at any other time he would have been the
                     first to pronounce an absurdity. The struggle within himself ended by his
                     yielding to what seemed to be the latter feeling.
                  "Dear Jocaste—permit me to make a last appeal—to tell you my whole soul. I love
                     you, Jocaste; I loved you from the first moment I saw you. I do not know what
                     scruples will affect you, but I will share and voluntarily seek with you
                     whatever dishonor attaches to you. I will abandon the army—I am willing to
                     become a deserter to sacrifice my honor and fortune to win."
                  The only answer made to this speech was a look of quiet wonder.
                  "Listen, Jocaste. I have passed through the four years with a reputation for
                     courage—what men most value. I have been with the Louisiana brigades during the
                     time that they must have numbered, altogether, ten thousand men, and seen them
                     reduced down and consolidated into a half brigade, which numbers only five
                     hundred. When I go into battle now, it is as a common soldier, because I have
                     escaped death and disease a little longer than the rest of my command. If I
                     consent now to be pronounced a deserter and a coward for your sake it is almost
                     equal to any sacrifice that it would be in the power of a woman to make. Can
                     you say more—can a man do more for the woman he loves. Otherwise it is not
                     asking much to endeavor to persuade you to abandon your present life, however
                     much surrounded with cold respect. Besides it is only the nature of a savage to
                     remain forever constant to what after all is only an abstract idea. You love
                     me—you have already confessed that. Why should you sacrifice your happiness
                     through life, where the sacrifice does no good—where it will only render two
                     existences miserable. You are a child of luxury—you cannot be happy without you
                     are surrounded by a thousand evidences of wealth which you cannot have now. We
                     can embark together for some other shore. We will then have sufficient fortune
                     to live, happy in each other's smile. Think of this before you tell me that we
                     never more can meet. If you say yes, it will not take long to place happiness
                     at the command of both. If you say no, I will not survive the next battle—I
                     will abandon with you life and hope."
                  "If I do not say no it is simply because I listen from a feeling of
                     curiosity—of former interest in anything whatever you may say. One truth should
                     be kept in mind. We cannot promise ourselves happiness, even that of the
                     senses, with any certainty, as the result of the commission of a crime. On the
                     other hand heaven as often as not presents sudden and undreamed of avenues, of
                     escape as a reward or principle and a devotion to honest and virtue. That is a
                     worldly answer to give your proposal. My real reason is that I am a woman with
                     some sense of virtue and shame."
                  The young officer whom she addressed gave one passionate, lingering, devouring
                     gaze and fled, rather than left, the room.
                  We had been comrades. When he left I followed him.
               
               
                  III.—THE MARCH.
                  The midnight march that followed, I shall never forget. The fire-fly lamps of
                     the earlier part of the evening had, though still far in front, increased a
                     thousand fold, had become consolidated into one murderous flash along both
                     lines, and in place of the intermittent report of minie muskets from the rifle
                     pits, the air resounded with one long continuous roar.
                  As we continued toward the front, the fall of shells became so destructive that
                     whole regiments were in danger of being swept away. They were either compelled
                     to take momentary shelter into the holes that had been previously cut in the
                     sides of the hills for refuge, or to march through the endless 
                        labarynthine
                        labyrinthine
                      mazes of ditches with which the whole country was intersected. At
                     some moments it seemed as if the thousand heavy guns with which the place was
                     besieged, and the double number of bombs, had been all vomiting forth their
                     wrath upon our moving column.
                  As volunteers to two regiments we had joined, we had been assigned the post of
                     honor—that is, as guard to the colors—the point in the line at which most shots
                     are aimed. How honorable the post was may be judged from the fact that in that
                     one regiment alone more than a half-dozen gallant standard-bearers had already
                     bit the dust, and the position of the men immediately around it was not more
                     secure. Indeed, we had not long been under fire before the color-sergeant was
                     stricken down, and the flag which he carried fell upon Jacinthe.
                  A trust of this sort was almost a legacy of death, and was one not always
                     eagerly disputed for by the bravest soldiers. But being thus marked out, there
                     was no avoiding the duty even if my comrade had felt disposed.
                  It is not necessary, at this time, to enter into any general description of the
                     battle, or of the movements upon that memorable day. One time we were compelled
                     to remain inactive under a heavy fire—the part of the day which even the
                     bravest soldier most dreads. At another, we were charging across a long plain,
                     bounded in front by hills that seemed almost perpendicular, and from which the
                     guns were raining destruction. We succeeded in crossing this, but could not
                     make good our position: were driven back to a river in our rear. Arrived at
                     this we found the opposite end of the bridge already in the hands of the enemy,
                     but this, by desperate fighting, we succeeded in regaining. After enduring so
                     much it might now be supposed that our thin column was to have been allowed a
                     little respite. But no. Our situation made it necessary that the column with
                     which we were should remain behind after the rest of our now broken army had
                     passed—without any support, and where our capture or death seemed inevitable.
                     But the situation was accepted as our destiny, and though doubtful of the
                     sacrifice, we remained at our post, or were slowly driven back through the
                     remainder of that dreadful day.
                  Struggling on in this way, and wondering at each moment, as the opposing rank
                     came nearer, ever nearer, that death did not overtake us, I at length remarked
                     that Capt. Jacinthe was affected with apparent emotion, and was gazing with earnestness in the opposite
                     ranks.
                  "Did you ever see shells fly thicker? You have not been struck? No? What, then,
                     is the matter?" I inquired.
                  "Do you see the officer who is advancing towards us from the opposite side, at
                     the head of his men?"
                  "Not well—who is he?"
                  "He is the man who betrayed me while pretending to act as my friend with the
                     woman I loved, and who, by false representations, led her to accept his own
                     hand. You do not see him—let me point him out with your musket—he will not
                     advance far afterwards."
                  Upon second thought, however, he released his hold upon my gun, and awaited
                     motionless the advance of the opposite ranks.
                  Our line was giving back; I motioned to my friend that we should move with the
                     others.
                  "Do not remain with me. I shall stay here precisely where I am," he said, "and
                     meet my enemy face to face. I am not interested in living—I shall therefore
                     without scruple receive or give face to face the death blow which 
                        in in
                        in
                      such a case is permitted an honorable man."
                  He had obviously made up his mind to die. I endeavored once more to induce him
                     to change his resolution. The cry of "rally to your colors' from our commander
                     to the troops and who were now called to form a line facing an attack from
                     another direction, left me no option about remaining. It was the last command
                     given. A continuous volley upon our men who appeared now to be surrounded, and
                     which seemed to come from every direction, virtually ended the struggle. Victor
                     and vanquished passed. The dead and dying remained possessors of the field.
                  I myself had, at a later hour, been wounded and left behind; and, crawling into
                     the thickest part of the shrubbery, I determined to lie concealed until I could
                     gain some tidings as to the way the battle had gone, or could escape in the
                     obscurity of night. When at length the time came, at which I thought it would
                     be prudent to move, I concluded to pass the spot where I had last seen my
                     wounded friend.
                  But the task of returning to the place wished for was one of no easy
                     accomplishment; it was almost impossible to move without treading upon the body
                     of some mangled corpse, or of poor wretches whose hour was only postponed,
                     hoarsely begging for water.
                  The scene was sufficiently appalling; it was the death agony repeated in a
                     thousand forms: upon each face was an expression of intense horror; the
                     expression of those who died a violent death, suffering and despairing, with no
                     one to witness the termination of life's tragedy but the camp followers,
                     already rifling their bodies.
               
               
                  IV.—DESOLATION.
                  Glancing around as I thus struggled painfully forward, the ruin and desolation
                     that had been wrought, and the spirit of which was still abroad, was brought
                     forcibly to my mind. Lying near me were two men, whose life but a short time
                     before had been occupied with numberless passions, and which were now upon the
                     threshold of death. Scattered around were a thousand corpses and wounded
                     soldiers in the last agonies of death. A battery had just been exploded—the
                     horses were tangled up by their harness in one inextricable mass while piled
                     together in one and the same heap were many of their drivers. Lastly as I
                     glanced back at the hospitable mansion in which a happy group had been
                     assembled the night previous, the whole building was discovered to be wrapped
                     in flames—an angry flush upon the distant horizon alone marked its exact site.
                     The inmates were now abroad and without shelter as likely as not, and perhaps
                     their bodies were strewn on some portions of the widely extended field.
                  "The prediction of ruin of Capt. Jacinthe has come true," I could not help
                     thinking. "It would have been better, as a merely 
                        wordly
                        worldly
                      calculation of human happiness, for Jocaste to have heeded his advice
                     was the reflection I could hardly help making. But at length I discovered the
                     place where I had left Jacinthe, and rejoiced to see that he still survived,
                     although faint from the loss of blood. His anticipation had come true. He had
                     met his rival in a hand to hand struggle, and by one of those strange
                     coincidences which make up the mystery of life, near him the wounded man lay,
                     his head horribly shattered with a fragment of shell. He was already senseless,
                     and though still conscious, was obviously dying, and gave no further signs of
                     life other than an involuntary tremor that convulsed his body, and the gasping
                     and panting that surely foretells dissolution. It was not permitted to judge
                     what the latter's thoughts were, but to have to pass from the world by a slow,
                     torturing death, with no one near but the man you have injured, is of all forms
                     the most terrible.
                  Once I thought we were about to be relieved. A surgeon passed who stopped with
                     his ambulance as if for the purpose of removing us. However, after a momentary
                     glance, he only ordered the ambulance driver to push on. As I protested against
                     his leaving us, he offered to carry me with him, but stated that my friend was
                     so badly wounded that there was no more use of removing him than of the
                     actually dying body at his side.
                  "You will not refuse a man that carried the regimental colors a chance, however
                     faint, of being restored to life?"
                  "Chance or not; there are hundred of others whose wounds better merit
                     attention. The question now is your own life, not that of your friends. Do you
                     wish to be removed?"
                  "No, I shall remain with him."
                  "There is no time to discuss the matter; push on with your mules, driver."
                  It might have been, perhaps, better for him, I subsequently learned, to have
                     complied with my prayer. A volley of muskets was heard shortly after he had
                     left us, fired by a party of returning soldiers who wished to unload their guns
                     and a bullet from one of these had taken effect upon him.
                  My companion and I were now left with nothing to occupy us but the groans of
                     the dead and dying. We lay there two days and nights almost entirely
                     unattended. A good-natured soldier would sometimes come along who would offer a
                     canteen of water, or tobacco: but there was no other way of helping us. There
                     we were compelled to lie with the sun, which now seemed to
                     us trebled as to the mad Œdipus shining full in our face. My comrade, like the
                     light which flickers up from the expiring socket, appeared struggling to regain
                     the final use of his speech and reason, and was commenting or rhapsodizing upon
                     the dreadful sight which lay before us. Indeed, we had both become so affected
                     with hunger and the loss of blood that the scene began to lose its reality—the
                     stretched out corpses to disappear—the picture of repose I had witnessed in the
                     hospitable mansion to recur more and more vividly, and to finally blend with
                     the actual surrounding reality. There was the lady whom Jacinthe had so
                     passionately addressed, moving about as noiselessly now as she did then—no more
                     excited—not more agitated. Now she was in the drawing-room—now on the
                     blood-stained battle-field— but in the actual present, or the scene conjured up
                     by my fancy, the look of half resigned sorrowful composure was ever the same.
                     The vague idea that death could yet be escaped became momentarily more and more
                     palpable.
                  At length she came so near that I could see the fluttering of her white
                     dress—could see her look of pain and hear her cry of distress as she witnessed
                     the death tragedy around her. It was Jocaste! There was no doubt of it, even to
                     the half delirious mind of my friend.
                  "See," he cried, was the last thing I remembered, "it is Jocaste who comes. She
                     will be our saving angel—she will yet rescue us. You saw more clearly into the
                     future than I, Jocaste. The convictions of a pure woman have come true—there is
                     no harm in loving now. He did not die by my hand. No harm now—I can love you
                     now."
                  It was the last battle, and Capt. Jacinthe did not die.
               
               
                  EXTRACT FROM A JOURNAL AFTER THE WAR.
                  Christ Church was yesterday the scene of one of the handsomest weddings ever
                     witnessed in New Orleans. The bride was a near relative of the * * * who
                     himself * * * As our lady readers may be interested in the dresses worn on the
                     occasion, we will try to describe them. The bride wore a white satin, high neck
                     and low sleeves, made en panier, with a long
                     train. Her veil was of silk tulle, very long.
                     The bridesmaids, eight in number, were attired in white tarleton, low neck and
                     short sleeves, also made en panier, looped up
                     will sprays of pink roses, long trails. The bodies were made with a Grecian
                     bertha, an old fashion lately revived, and very pretty and very becoming. They
                     wore demi-veils. The ceremony was impressively performed by the bishop,
                     assisted by Rev. Dr. Leacock and two other
                     clergymen.—Crescent.
               
            
            
               
               THE LATE BLOODY DUEL.
               STATEMENT OF THE FACTS BY ONE OF THE PRINCIPALS.
               
                  I—VINDICATION.
                  It has not been a great while since the public of this city were startled by an
                     account of a duel, spoken of at the time as of a desperate and bloody
                     character, and as resulting in six wounds to one of the parties and eight to
                     the other. No names were given, beyond the statement that one of the
                     participants was a Creole and the other a native of France; or any description
                     given, except an intimation that both parties were of high social standing.
                  Without giving the facts or names any additional publicity, I have now to state
                     that the writer of this narrative was indicated under the name of "Creole" in
                     the various accounts thus far published. These differed in their character—some
                     going so far even as to intimate that the duel was a hoax—but whether
                     contradictory or confirmatory of the main story, they were all the versions of
                     the affair circulated in the interests hostile to me.
                  As a matter which concerns the happiness of a lifetime and the honor of
                     innocent third parties, I deem it my duty to silence by a candid narrative the
                     allegations and whispers which have been put in circulation.
               
               
                  II—NARRATIVE.
                  Previous to speaking of the difficulty, it is proper to state that I had at one
                     time been involved in a heart-affair with a young lady from up the coast, in
                     fact with the well known Mlle. Melusine L—, a lady of very high standing and
                     connections. For two or three seasons no evening assembly was complete without
                     her presence, and except in two particulars now to be named her position was
                     still unrivaled.
                  The first of these defects grew out of an old family scandal, alleged to have
                     been committed in a previous generation, and which it was now possible would
                     come to light.
                  The second fact which threatened her position was the apprehended loss of the
                     well-known Godwin estate, to which she had hitherto been considered the
                     undisputed heir.
                  The Godwin plantation, as everybody knows, still extends for fifteen miles
                     along the river, and under fall cultivation would be one of the most valuable
                     in the South. Previous to the war, it was, in autumn, an unbounded, an unbroken
                     surface of waving emerald cane, uncut by fences or boundaries, and into the
                     depths of which the agent himself, who controlled the estate, would not have
                     rashly ventured for fear of losing his way.
                  The threatened attack to the honor and reputation of the family, both owed
                     their origin to a suit which had been instituted by a collateral relation. This
                     relative was well known to many by the name of Henry Richbourg, and he now
                     sought, by a formal suit, to set aside the regular succession. Should this suit
                     be successful, it would have the effect of deciding, first, that the marriage
                     resulting in the birth of Mlle. L— was invalid, (therefore, that the lady
                     herself was not of legitimate birth;) secondly, (and as a 
                        conseqcence
                        consequence
                      of the same invalidity of marriage,) that the rightful owner to the
                     Godwin succession would be Richbourg, and not Mlle. L—.
                  I had been a claimant to the band of M'lle L., and had been well received
                     before the suit had been instituted, or rather about the time it was first
                     spoken of, and the possibilities of a compromise argued. The acquaintance once
                     formed had ripened so rapidly into a warmer feeling that it was not until an
                     attachment upon one side for life had been formed, that the difficulties of the
                     situation were realized. For be it well understood from the commencement of the
                     suit, a compromise was possible upon very simple terms.
                  This was nothing lees than the marriage of M'lle L— to a cousin in the second
                     degree, and who was the son of the Richbourg commencing the suit.
                  Nor was there apparently any strong reason why Christoval Richbourg, the son in
                     question, should have been objected to 
                        us
                        as
                      a suitor. He was, it was true, a little selfish perhaps, but then he
                     was a man of the world, and though he never gave any indication of being
                     possessed of any principle every one admitted that he was good nature and
                     really excellent company. His father was detested; but it had still never
                     prevented M. Christoval from being received, and from being really liked by his
                     fair cousin and the rest of her family.
                  In this state of affairs it needs but little explanation as to what followed. A
                     marriage was determined upon between the heads of the two families. Lastly, the
                     tender friendships existing between myself and M'lle Melusine was shaken by a
                     series of contretemps and misunderstandings,
                     which the most delicate tact could not always foresee or avoid, and which the
                     most amiable desire for a reconciliation could not always explain away.
                     Finally, during the last Jockey Club ball, an open rupture had resulted, which
                     admitted of no explanation.
                  Christoval and I, although well aware of each other's claims, had thus far
                     mutually agreed to be philosophical rivals, and had frequently occupied our
                     time together in many of the fashionable follies of the day. On the occasion in
                     question he had been present at the misunderstanding standing alluded to, and had apparently made a
                     friendly effort to avert the quarrel. Instead of so doing, however, his efforts
                     only ended by aggravating and inflaming both parties.
                  Lastly, to complete the estrangement, I had been induced to draw a note in
                     Richbourg's favor to assist him about a debt of honor. He had not only lost
                     heavily, but had given a supper which had included a number of the artistes of
                     the city theatres. I assisted him in paying this debt by the use of my name
                     with a well known broker on St. Charles street. Judge, then, of my astonishment
                     at discovering, some time after, that my name had been forged to several
                     similar sums which Richbourg had calculated to take up immediately after his
                     marriage, and before discovery.
                  Shortly after this piece of news was communicated to me, I met Richbourg upon
                     Carondelet street in full mid-day. All of the rage and hatred that had been
                     gradually gathering against himself and family, found utterance in the feelings
                     of the moment.
                  "You make a cool thing of it in the matter of living, M. Richbourg," I said to
                     him; "you first, through terror of losing name and wealth, frighten an
                     honorable family into receiving you as a son-in-law. You next manage affairs so
                     well, that a young lady, already betrothed to another, is induced to break her
                     engagement; and not satisfied with this, the game you now propose playing is by
                     a downright crime to force the man you have injured to pay for your vices."
                  "To do Richbourg justice, I had never suspected his courage. On the contrary,
                     his nerves seemed made of strong fibre, and his hand in a pistol gallery was
                     considered as steady as that of any man about town. Travis, when he formerly
                     kept a pistol gallery in the city, had frequently alluded in terms of
                     admiration to his practice.
                  I therefore was not a little astonished to find that Richbourg, instead of
                     attempting to exonerate himself from the stigma thrown upon his honor, had
                     merely begged for an opportunity for an explanation, spoke of circumstances
                     which would fully justify him, and made similar apologies. Several prominent
                     brokers and commission merchants, with whom I had had business dealings, here,
                     too, interfered, and by their remonstrances convinced me that whether Richbourg
                     was or was not a forger, that the matter was not, in any event, worth the
                     trouble of making a scene. Among others who were particularly active in
                     preventing a difficulty, was Dr. D——. This affair occurred at about two
                     o'clock.
                  At a tolerably early hour in the evening of the same day, after a momentary
                     attendance in the Jesuit Church at the wedding of a friend, after strolling
                     through two or three of the club rooms and the theatres, I was annoyed to find
                     myself unable to meet with any of my more intimate acquaintances.
                  Just as I was, however, coming out of the Varieties Theatre, I encountered Dr.
                     D—— the second time. He now appeared in a state of some hurry and excitement,
                     though at the same time I thought I detected from his manner that he had been
                     in search of me.
                  I had never greatly liked the Doctor: but in the mood in which I was then his
                     apparent haste seemed to me an excellent reason for detaining him.
                  "You are really to-night," I said to him, "a gift sent from Heaven, Doctor. Do
                     you know that I have looked all through the town, and have been unable to
                     discover a soul."
                  "No wonder. We are to have a grand affair in one of our up-town palatial
                     residences. Everybody's either dressing to go, or already there."
                  "I have heard nothing of it."
                  "No? But I see from the rose in your button hole that you have been
                     somewhere?"
                  "That was the wedding of S—— at the Jesuits, which took place ——"
                  "But this is the same affair—only the venue has now been changed from the
                     church to the residence."
                  "In that case, I believe I have tickets."
                  "Then you certainly intend going?"
                  "No, I never ——"
                  "But you are already dressed." The doctor seemed extremely anxious that I
                     should attend.
                  "But I tell you I never go to parties."
                  "This is the grandest affair of the season. It will be more like an European
                     entertainment, or rather an Arabian Night's Entertainment, than any given
                     during the year. The house, which is a large one, will be lighted up from top
                     to bottom, including the gardens and conservatories."
                  "Nevertheless—"
                  "Besides," said Dr. D——, "you will have an opportunity of seeing M'lle L—— this
                     evening. She will be there."
                  This, then, was his motive for wishing me to go—some reason connected with
                     her.
                  "It will be about your last time, under her present name. Take my advice, and
                     have a final interview."
                  "M'lle Melusine is, as you say, soon to be married. Besides, her husband that
                     is to be, is no friend of mine."
                  "It is not a conventional reason for staying away."
                  "Possibly," added the doctor, "Melusine may wish to see you."
                  I looked at him for further information.
                  "Of course," he added, "it is not permitted for a physician to make any
                     allusion to conversations he may have heard in his professional capacity. If I
                     am to make a suggestion, however, in the matter, possibly M'lle Melusine wishes
                     to demand the return of some former presents now in your possession."
                  I was obliged to admit to myself that she had given me her miniature when our
                     friendship was perfect, and that she had now a right to ask its
                     restitution.
                  "If you recommend under the circumstances, Doctor, an accidental meeting"——
                  "If you go, I will take it upon myself to predict that there will be a
                     meeting."
                  The persistence of the Doctor, in what to him was a matter of trifling
                     importance, still appeared to me a little singular; but I immediately replied:
                     "Say no more; let us order a carriage."
                  The moment after we were on our way.
               
               
                  III—THE SOIREE.
                  The night, though in mid-winter, as frequently happens in this climate, was
                     almost sultry, and upon our arrival we found the gardens, which had been
                     illuminated with transparencies and parti-colored lights, were filled with
                     gaily dressed couples, taking a breathing spell after the last dance. The notes
                     of the band were warning them to get ready for the next.
                  Our first duty upon arriving was, of course, to pay our formal compliments to
                     the lady of the house, with whom I was well acquainted, and to whom I now
                     discovered that Dr. D—— had been paying marked attention. Leaving the Doctor
                     still in her company, after my formal salutation, my next duty was to make the
                     felicitations to the bride and groom, which, whether real or satirical, are
                     exacted in society. A visit to the supper rooms with these—a taste of the
                     edibles, punch and still more undisguised fluids soon had affected me with what
                     might be called the atmosphere of polite assemblies.
                  On returning to the principal drawingroom, I remarked that the Doctor and Mme.
                     Z——, our hostess, still appeared in close consultation.
                  At the same time, too, I remarked that Mlle. Melusine was present at the
                     entertainment, ravishingly beautiful and in the most eblouissante costume. In
                     promenading, she once or twice passed very near were I was standing, but with
                     no other result than the formal recognition of a drawingroom.
                  Her manner led we to infer that I had been imposed upon by Dr. D——, and that
                     there was nothing to be said one way or the other.
                  Becoming wearied at length with the excitable young men who danced and talked
                     too much, and the impracticable or rheumatic class who did neither, and half
                     excited half annoyed by the snowy figures in tulle, debraille and decolte, with
                     skirts looped up with flowers, and with breasts studded with diamonds—I was
                     about to accept a seat in the carriage of a male acquaintance and return to the
                     city. A glance at this moment from Mme. Z—— restrained me, and brought me to
                     her side. Dr. D——, upon my approach, resigned his post.
                  She took my arm with that soft coquetry of manner and that resting of the
                     weight upon the arm, which indicated a hostess thoroughly rusee, and which banished in advance any
                     disposition to struggle with her caprices. Complaining of heat, she led the way
                     to the gardens.
                  "It is merely a breath of fresh air I want," she said; "I am in the humor to
                     inhale the perfume of the orange and magnolia."
                  "You are right, Madame, to appreciate their value. Doctor D—— has informed me
                     on the way to your residence you have the finest conservatory of plants in the
                     city."
                  It is, in fact, arranged as a drawing-room. If you will escort me that far I
                     will reward you with a bouquet of exotica not elsewhere to be found in the
                     city."
                  We had reached the glass doors and entered the perfume-laden atmosphere before
                     I had time to properly reply to the compliment. What still further prevented me
                     was at suddenly encountering M'lle. Melusine half concealed at the upper end of
                     the conservatory, behind some of the thousand evergreen plants with which the
                     house abounded. She was at the time upon the arm of Dr. D——, and doubtless had
                     no intimation in advance of my presence.
                  Mme. Z—— and the Doctor, the only ones who knew what was coming, exchanged
                     gestures and phrases of 
                        suprrise
                        surprise
                      at the unexpected meeting. I bowed to Mlle. L—— with empressment, and
                     spoke with an effort to appear untroubled at the situation of the commonplaces
                     sacred to polite assemblies.
                  This was the first situation. The next was that the Doctor was honored with the
                     conversation upon exotica, which had at first seemed in store for me. The last
                     was that Mme. Z——, before her floral lecture was exhausted, had been summoned
                     as mistress of the revels elsewhere, and had left me alone with Mlle.
                     Melusine.
                  There remained nothing, it seemed to me, but to avoid any useless exhibition of
                     feeling, and to listen to the announcement of the approaching marriage without
                     any display of passion. In demanding from me the return of her miniature, I
                     anticipated that some illusion would naturally be made to our former
                     attachment, and was prepared—as there had been nothing she could complain of in
                     my conduct—for the reiteration of many of her former protestations of
                     friendship.
                  "Dr. D——," I remarked, by way of commencing the conversation, "has been so rude
                     as to forget his duty to his escort. Will you accept my arm in his stead?"
                  She made a slight gesture of refusal.
                  "This interview has been unexpected, on my part," she said. "Since, however, we
                     have met, will you let me hope that we meet as friends?"
                  I contented myself with making use of the polite and tender phrases, which,
                     upon such occasions, are always the same.
                  "The moth has singed his wings," I observed good naturedly. "There is no
                     particular use in discussing now what was the extent of his misfortune."
                  "You seem to be amusing yourself with employing these old love phrases."
                  "Since you expect me to ask questions, does your wedding take place soon?"
                  "It seems so written, if I am to let my friends have their way."
                  "In that case it would be a selfish feeling to seek to occupy too much of your
                     time. It would be profiting by your generosity."
                  "I intend proving to you that I am generous. I believe, in spite of your
                     affected indifference, that you once loved me. I am sure that I love you. Do
                     you love me still?"
                  "No, Mlle Melusine—since you ask for an honest answer, and the truth must be
                     spoken."
                  I had been prepared for the last speech she made me. I thought my answer the
                     simplest way of ending a sentimental conversation that would have no meaning.
                     But I was scarcely prepared for the shock that appeared to have been given to
                     her wounded vanity or pride.
                  "Are you in earnest?" she gasped, with a bewildered air.
                  "Never more so."
                  "I will not believe what you tell me. Support me at any rate to the drawing
                     room."
                  Looking at her closely I remarked that her face was overspread with a sickly
                     pallor. Her arm was trembling violently. What I had at first thoughts was
                     manly, straightforward conduct, now seemed to me like brutality, and I now
                     regretted, first, attending the soiree at all, and, secondly, at not having
                     listened with some show of interest and sentiment to M'lle Melusine's
                     explanation.
                  "I am sorry Miss L—— that my words appeared ill-natured. At the same time if
                     you are to marry Richbourg—"
                  "As I hope to live in Heaven what I have already told you was the thought of my
                     heart."
                  "And Richbourg?"
                  "I do not intend to marry him, and have never so promised—I can be poor, and
                     never see the Godwin plantation waving with cane again. Only for the sake of my
                     friends——"
                  "If that is your trouble, the stigma which Richbourg has endeavored to fix upon
                     your house really rests on his own. He was born in France of a quadroon mother,
                     who was carried from this State by his father, and has no show of title."
                  "And you have never told me this before?"
                  "It was not then my affair."
                  Mme. Z——, still leaning upon the arm of the Doctor, re-entered. I felt grateful
                     to them for what seemed a kind interference on their part. The conversation
                     became general. Before we had reached the entrance of the house, Mme. Z—— cried
                     that she had left her handkerchief behind in gathering her bouquet. Would I
                     have the goodness to return for it?
                  The mission was an annoying not to say a singular one, but I silently resigned
                     the arm of Melusine.
                  "Its lace," she added, "makes it more valuable than you might at first imagine.
                     Besides, some Iago may work with it an Othello-like tragedy."
                  The allusion and the fact that at such a moment any such request had been made
                     at all, awakened in me a superstitious feeling, and led me to doubt the motive that had prompted an
                     interference from the Doctor and M'me Z——. That this suspicion was not
                     unfounded, will be seen from the event I am now called upon to relate.
               
               
                  IV.—A MEETING.
                  In returning I found Richbourg standing where I had but a moment previous
                     conversed with Melusine. In his hand he held the handkerchief and bouquet for
                     which I had come in search. His air seemed to indicate that he had calculated
                     upon my returning. The question again occurred to me why Mme. Z—— had requested
                     me to return in place of Dr. D——, for the trifles which Richbourg held in his
                     hand.
                  I am not at all a believer in coincidences or accidents, and the fact that he
                     stood there at that moment at all had but one meaning for me. He was obviously
                     my deadly enemy after the rencontre which I have already narrated. He had not
                     declined fighting me then from lack of courage, but because the charges I had
                     made against him were well grounded. His plan obviously was to quarrel now in
                     such a way that he should show his attachment for M'lle L——, and at the same
                     time avenge a private insult.
                  The rivalry between us had now reached its extreme degree, and, if he had done
                     me great wrong, I was at the same time compelled to admit that I had dealt
                     sufficient stabs to his reputation to form something like an equivalent. It was
                     not my belief that I owed every thief or adventurer any apology, when necessity
                     compelled me to expose, or that I was obliged to stimulate with my life against
                     theirs. Possibly in a cooler and more guarded moment, this consideration would
                     have affected my conduct. Upon the present occasion I was not in the mood to go
                     out of my way to avoid a quarrel. We each felt that we stood in each other's
                     path to happiness. Without a word being spoken. Obviously he had intended to
                     get me out of the way at all hazards.
                  "Permit me to trouble you for the flowers you hold in your hand, M. Richbourg,"
                     I said to him, "I have been sent for them by their owner."
                  "These trifles—I resign them with all my heart."
                  His manner was polite, and he commenced in a roundabout manner, and by
                     employing high-sounding phrases to betray the purpose he had at heart.
                  "Come to the point at once, Richbourg; what is it you wish to say?"
                  "Plainly, then, I have to complain that 
                        your your
                        your
                      conduct has not been that of an honorable man in forcing the lady who
                     is to be my wife into a very long interview."
                  The charge made was precisely one that I had struggled the hardest to avoid. My
                     first impulse was to fell him to the ground. Reflecting for a moment that such
                     procedure would be rather the character of a ruffian than of a gentleman at a
                     private party, I contented myself with pronouncing his statement false in every
                     particular and inquiring what he further wished to suggest.
                  "Why, nothing; only it is now near daybreak, and any man of honor you may bring
                     along with you will be sufficient for a witness. I believe we are about equal
                     in the pistol gallery, and that if anything you ring the bell—"
                  "You know nothing of the sort, Richbourg. You are my superior at pistol
                     practice, and I am scarcely your equal with swords. However, I shall not object
                     to your weapons any more than I shall object to the friends whom you shall
                     bring along as witnesses—simply because I do not just now care to be troubled
                     about the matter one way or the other. Have what weapons you will. Take along
                     whom you may choose. As for myself, I shall amuse myself in this house an hour
                     or two longer, without troubling myself whether I am to kill you or you are to
                     exercise the same privilege toward me."
                  "In that case we will have to return towards Canal street for weapons. I know
                     the sexton of the St. Louis Cemetery. A couple of hours from now I will meet
                     you there with the keys. "
                  "It is understood."
                  I had been in hopes of speaking a moment with Melusine before leaving, but she
                     evidently thought she had given me enough of her attention for one evening, and
                     I was forced to resign myself to the simple pleasure of remaining a little
                     longer in the same apartment. I looked around, too, for some one in whose
                     judgment I had more confidence in than in that of Dr. D——, but was ultimately
                     obliged to accept him.
               
               
                  V.—THE STRUGGLE.
                  Upon reaching the Cemetery, I found that Richbourg had brought no one with him.
                     Two or three excuses were urged for this, which, under the circumstances,
                     seemed plausible enough. The consequence, however, was that Dr. D—— was the
                     only party present either as witness or physician. Richbourg I knew to be
                     perfectly unscrupulous. When, therefore, he proposed that we should stand only
                     three paces apart, I fully made up my mind that one or the other would at the
                     least be dangerously wounded. Provided that the signal was given fairly, the
                     chances of life would depend upon the obtaining the first shot.
                  Dr. D—— decided by lot the position, and assigned to each our place. The
                     pistols which Richbourg had brought were placed in our hands. Having made the
                     customary announcement of what the words for firing would be, and having
                     stated, as was the duty of a second, that he would discharge the pistol held in
                     his hand at the party who fired before or after the command, we took our
                     places.
                  "Are you ready?" said Dr. D——.
                  "Ready," said Richbourg and I, at the same moment.
                  "Fire—one, two, three—stop."
                  The pistol I held in my hand was discharged as he uttered the word fire.
                     Richbourg staggered and fell. As he did so his pistol, as nearly always happens
                     in such cases, was discharged in the air.
                  Dr. D—— sprang to his assistance and bent over his body. A professional shake
                     of his head and the tone of Richbourg's voice almost anticipated inquiry.
                  At the same moment a voice was heard at the gates as of some one attempting to
                     force an entrance. Watchmen's rattles were sounded in two places, and from the
                     direction of the Old Globe Ballroom could be heard the rushing of a crowd in
                     the direction of the firing.
                  "The Captain of the Third Precinct and of the faubourg Treme appear to be both
                     beating at the gates from opposite directions," said Dr. D——, who appeared not
                     a little agitated at the situation.
                  "I am afraid it is all over with me," said Richbourg, in his usually calm
                     voice. He endeavored to make some requests of the Doctor, but his voice
                     failed.
                  "If you take my advice," said the latter to me, "you will lose no time in
                     making your escape through one of the side gates, of which we still have the
                     key. See—they have already forced an entrance by the front. I will have to
                     remain here and take care of Richbourg, in any event, as physician. And in a
                     moment there will be enough assistance. Get out of the city and remain away
                     until the affair blows over."
                  I thought Dr. D——'s advice too excellent to be disregarded. I succeeded in
                     regaining the carriage, and having ordered the driver to proceed ceed to my
                     room, abandoned myself to a thousand reproaches for having been led into a
                     situation which would separate me from the woman whom I now more than ever
                     loved.
                  Having made my preparations for departure, and it being very nearly daybreak, I
                     determined to leave the city by the Opelonsas train.
                  In going to the ferry near Jackson Square, the carriage passed in front of the
                     old Orleans Ballroom, and the lights which shone from its windows told me that
                     the orgies which are still occasionally there held had not yet terminated. It
                     was a place of which I knew little, and which at any other time I would have
                     avoided; but in the feverish anxiety I had to learn of Richbourg's condition, I
                     now without hesitation entered.
                  If I had, as I did so, seen a ghost or a dead man risen from his grave, it
                     would not have startled me more than the sight which now confronted my
                     eyes.
                  It was nothing less than Richbourg and Dr. D., with their backs turned toward
                     me, but easily recognizable by their voices. They were telling a very laughable
                     story—of a mock-duel—of the pretended fatal wounding of one of the parties, and
                     of the flight from the city of the duped survivor.
                  In a moment I had forgotten the pangs of remorse and the compunctions of
                     conscience that I had but a little before suffered; I forgot that I was
                     surrounded by the fastest and most profligate men and women of the city in
                     every variety of fantastic costume, and that the scene was no place for
                     avenging an insult.
                  Quickly, approaching Richbourg as he was about ending his clever story, and was
                     expecting the laugh of his audience, I dealt him, by way of a point to his
                     story, a blow full in the face. It sent him reeling to the floor.
                  Before he could recover himself I had seized and drawn from its sheath the
                     sabre of one of the masqueraders who stood near me.
                  "You have had your choice, 
                        Rochbourg
                        Richbourg
                     , and it is now for me to decide what the weapons, time and place
                     shall be. They are all here."
                  Every one knows, that is familiar with the history of the city, that one of the
                     balls connected with the Orleans Ball-room, is frequently used for duels.
                  It was used for such a purpose on the present occasion.
                  As for Richbourg, placed as he was, it was neither his policy or desire to
                     escape a struggle to the death. When we, therefore, adjourned to the ball in
                     question, it was fully understood on both sides that it would be a death
                     grapple. We went into it stripped of our shoes and most of our clothing—with
                     bare arms and exposed breasts. That it was characterized with more ferocity and
                     a longer duration than any duel fought in the city for years, was but the
                     result of the facts already related.
                  The various journals of the city have correctly described the affair, in most
                     of its particulars, and, as is already known, I received eight wounds and
                     Richbourg six—the last, which was a full sabre stroke across his jaw, inflicted
                     the mortal wound which ended the struggle.
               
               
                  VI.—CONCLUSION.
                  That under the circumstances I should be affected at the death of Richbourg;
                     that it should be a misfortune to me in every respect, and that any explanation
                     upon this subject at all should be painful, I need hardly state. It will hardly
                     be any news to those familiar with the facts, that my motives and conduct have
                     been in every way 
                        miscontrued
                        misconstrued
                      and maligned; and among other slanders the story that Richbourg was
                     shortly to have married M'lle L——, and that that lady was pining away from
                     disappointed love, was the most industriously circulated.
                  The plain statement of facts just made, and which will be substantiated by all
                     who were witnesses, will be a sufficient reply to a portion of these charges.
                     The best answer, however, is, that the contract of marriage was formally made
                     and solemnized between myself and Mlle. Melusine L—— upon the first day that I
                     had sufficiently recovered from my wounds to admit of the performance of the
                     ceremony.
               
            
            
               
               THE SILENT REVENGES OF TIME.
               
                  FIRST PHASE OF THE CASE.
                  In the last volume of the Louisiana Supreme Court Reports, (vol. 21, Bloomfield
                     & Co., publishers—advance sheets,) the decision is rendered in the
                     well-known case of Nazaire vs. the succession of Dalzel Macay. The case will be
                     readily recalled to mind by every one familiar with the history and traditions
                     of the city, and by a good many readers, in consequence of the discussion
                     elicited in reference to the suit before the Legislature. The case will be
                     remembered, too, in consequence of the sudden and unexpected quarrel between
                     Governor Warmoth and Auditor G. M. Wickliffe.
                  This (particularly since the incarceration of Wickliffe in the Parish Prison)
                     has led to various surmises as to its cause; and statements, all of them more
                     or less false, have been advanced to explain a breach where friendship appeared
                     to the last degree necessary. Among other causes assigned is the disagreement
                     which grew out of the disposition to be made of the Macay estate, (after it had
                     reverted to the State,) valued at an immense amount. As this rumor has been
                     dwelt upon by the well-informed with more persistence than any other, and as
                     the nature of the suit is but little understood, we have taken some pains to
                     collate the singular and extraordinary facts of the case. These facts have been
                     taken from the decisions of the Supreme Court, the arguments of counsel, and
                     the statements of some of the innumerable witnesses introduced upon the
                     stand.
                  
                     By Judge How—The present suit exhibits much more of the feelings
                     and passions, the infirmity of human will, than one would expect to meet in the
                     ordinarily dry and arid province of law. Apart from the details and
                     technicalities of the suit, the main question involved is one of worldly
                     success—one as to the shortest avenues to wealth and preferment. At a time when
                     the struggle in life is one of short cuts and abrupt turns, when honesty is
                     doubted of being the best policy, and the goal to honor lies through some
                        em other path than that pointed out by conscience, the
                     case under consideration well merits examination and study.
                  
                     Argument of Judge Campbell—The facts now under consideration
                     originated previous to the commencement of the century—at a time when Louisiana
                     was a province, and was ruled by that most debased of all governments, a
                     Spanish Viceroyalty. It was in the days when the bribery of government officers
                     and officials were looked upon as a matter of course. We have grown better
                     since, and changed all of that now.
                  
                     Evidence of J. W. Zacharie—My acquaintance with Dalzel Macay
                     dated almost from the commencement of the century—fully fifty years ago. Macay
                     had come down the river to this city upon a flat boat as an adventurer, and at
                     that time did not know how to read or write. His first success was to obtain a
                     situation as clerk with an old quadroon storekeeper. He had not been there long
                     before he succeeded in acquiring the rudiments of education. He also succeeded
                     in swindling his employer out of his interest in his store. Witness being asked
                     where the store was situated, states that it was on Chartres street, in the
                     building now occupied by Auguste, as a restaurant.
                  
                     Alfred Hennen, sworn—Dalzel Macay was the most successful and
                     unscrupulous of the speculators of a generation ago. He succeeded partly by his
                     energy and capacity, by monopolies bought from the Governors and legislative
                     bodies, partly by his extraordinary luck. He had in the outset of his business
                     commenced with his brother Nicomede, a much abler but more generous man, and it
                     was Nicomede's popularity and talent that established the firm. Nicomede,
                     however, left the business in Dalzel Macay's hands, and was ultimately
                     defrauded of his interest. About the time he was ruined, he died, and his wife
                     was married by Dalzel, his brother. Macay's fortune became so large that he
                     built the magnificent residence then spoken of as a palace, which was
                     subsequently purchased at a cost of $100,000 for the Governor's residence. A
                     popular rumor had it that Macay had intended paving the flooring with
                     doubloons, and that he was only prevented from doing so because the coins bore
                     the head of the Spanish monarch. But this story was not in accordance with his
                     tastes, which were generally sordid. A much more probable story was that he was
                     buried in the same coat he wore when he first came to the State.
                  
                     E. J. Fors'all, sworn—The late Dalzel Macay invested a large part
                     of his wealth in real estate in the Second District, and this investment of
                     his, owing to its amount and the policy pursued of Mr. Macay, was a great
                     misfortune to that portion of the city. It was a misfortune because he refused
                     to expend money in repairs; because all of the buildings he owned soon assumed
                     an old and tumble-down appearance, very much in accordance with Mr. Dalzel's
                     own threadbare raiment. Upon all of the squares owned by him his titles hung like a curse. His policy affected the
                     property of all who had the misfortune to own real estate in the same part of
                     the city. Houses declined, instead of increasing in value. The city grew and
                     was built up in an opposite direction to what was then its tendency. The street
                     upon which he lived ceased, in course of time, to be desirable for residences,
                     and from being one of the most fashionable in the city, has ever 
                        sinec
                        since
                      been the home for outcasts.
                  
                     Dr. Warren Soue, sworn—Resides on Canal, near
                     Claiborne. Witness was called upon to at tend Mr. Dalzel Macay a short time
                     before his retirement from this city to a residence he had purchased in Pointe
                     Coupee parish. Upon his leaving the city Macay took with him his wife and a
                     servant of hers, a young girl named Proserpine. The girl had been brought up to
                     the business of a couffeuse, as I had subsequently reason to ascertain, and
                     this ostensible profession she had made to cover that of a procuress. Her
                     reputation as an intruigante or go-between was notorious. Once at Macay's
                     house, in Pointe Coupee, she had succeeded, without much effort, in supplanting
                     her mistress. The poor woman, who had always suffered remorse for having
                     married the brother of her former husband, unable to endure indifference,
                     neglect and the separation from her friends, pined away and was ultimately
                     removed from a life, which had become unendurable by death.
                  
                     Frank Haynes, sworn—The late Mr. Macay was regarded with a great
                     deal of indignation by the people of 
                        Point
                        Pointe
                      Coupee parish, because of his openly allowing his mistress to succeed
                     to the place of his white. What added to this feeling was, that contrary to all
                     precedent a legitimate child was allowed to remain under the girl Proserpine's
                     control. The latter herself became the mother of children by Macay. His house
                     was so little visited after the death of his wife, and he had so much lost in
                     caste, that not many knew which of his children had been born in wedlock.

                     to have seen the deceased a week before his death, who came to the gallery of
                     witness in company with a much younger woman, by whom he seemed much
                     influenced. The old man then seemed in his dotage, and his idea appeared to be
                     that a full length portrait was to be executed from the daguerreotype to adorn
                     some public building after his death. Witness remembers the circumstance
                     perfectly because the picture was one of the first ever taken in the State, and
                     because the bill was never paid.
                  
                     Judge Thos. J. Cooley, sworn—Was living in the same parish with
                     Mr. Macay as a boy, when it was one day announced that the old man had died
                     suddenly in bed. Macay was well advanced in years, and his attendant physician
                     saw nothing suspicious in his death. Before the matter could be put to
                     examination a burial certificate was issued, and the body was disposed of by
                     interment. However, the death became subsequently so much talked of that the
                     corpse was exhumed, and some indications of poison were thought to have been
                     discovered. The deceased was supposed to have been murdered by Proserpine, the
                     quadroon who was living with him at the time of his death, but no conviction
                     could be obtained.
               
               
                  HOW THE ESTATE WAS DISPOSED OF BY WILL.
                  Macay had, up to the time of his death, according to all of the witnesses,
                     lived, what he considered, a prosperous, successful sort of life. He had
                     accomplished what he set out to do in accumulating a fortune, and he had taken
                     the precaution to reduce his wishes for the disposition of his property after
                     death to writing in the form of a will. The following were the three
                     dispositions made, according to the submitted brief of F. Zacharie, of counsel
                     for the prosecution:
                  I. A life interest in a large three-story brick mansion at the corner of St.
                     Peter and Basin streets, valued at $15,000, was bequeathed by Macay to the
                     hair-dresser, his Morganatic widow. The house was to revert to his daughter
                     after death. [According to ex-Sheriff Tom Parker, a feeling of regard for the
                     memory of the father after his death, and which he had never shown for himself
                     while living, prevented the daughter Eurydice from claiming this estate after
                     it had lapsed. Rather than expose the past life of her father, the title to the
                     house after the death of Macay was not questioned.]
                  II. An annuity upon his fortune of $5000 he left to his legitimate daughter
                     Eurydice. This sum was to be paid out of the residue of his estate by his
                     general executor.
                  III. The remaining portion of his fortune, and which in the popular estimation
                     had swollen to a gigantic bulk, was ostensibly set apart for the founding of a
                     charitable institution. In his will, relating to this eleemosynary institution,
                     Macay had entrusted (the first instance of confidence mentioned in his career)
                     the management of his wealth into the hands which, as the result showed, were
                     the least capable of dealing honestly with it.
                  A peculiarity of the will was that in case any legal difficulties were
                     discovered in the execution of the last bequest, the property was to revert to
                     his daughter. But the will was so drawn that it appeared certain that such
                     difficulties would arise, from the face of it. One very natural supposition was
                     that old Macay, with the cunning of an old man, in his dotage, had amused
                     himself by wishing to appear benevolent upon his death bed. He had naturally
                     calculated (so many reasoned) that his property (in accordance with express
                     State statue and the defect already mentioned) would come into his daughter's
                     hands just the same as if no such 
                        provison
                        provision
                      had been made.
                  Macay's calculation would have proved true, (if the supposition was well
                     founded,) had his daughter, after his death, insisted upon being put in
                     possession of her rights. Through respect for the charitable nature of the
                     bequest, no such struggle was attempted.
                  So much for the disposal of the fortune by will.
                  According to the statements of Messrs. Thomas B. Sloo, Urquhart, Burnside and
                     Thos. A. Adams, when the nephew of Macay (Corazon was his name) came to examine
                     into the affairs of the estate, a much larger schedule of debts were filed than
                     had been ever dreamed of. Secondly, some of the legal complications into which
                     the estate had fallen had consumed a portion of it. Added to this, the most
                     valuable portion of his lands appeared to have been transferred before his
                     death, though no receipts or representative money could be found to account for
                     the deficiency.
                  As his character was known to have been notoriously miserly he opinion soon
                     went abroad that his treasure had been secreted before his death. Still
                     Corazon, his nephew and trustee, had obtained possession of a considerable
                     amount of money for the execution of the benevolent trust imposed. The question
                     then very frequently asked in after years was what had become of it. It is true
                     that a great deal was said about what should be the proper form for the new
                     building—the journals of the day advertised for plans and specifications. In
                     fact the foundations of a building were laid by Messrs. Murray &
                        Pilie, with much solemn speech-making, pomp and ceremony,
                     but subsequently quently abandoned for some obvious defect in the plans or
                     unhealthiness in the situation selected. The bequest beyond this point was lost
                     sight of. Nobody had a right to make inquiries as to the way in which the
                     charitable fund might be managed. There being no necessity whatever for making
                     any exposition to the public of the disposition of the estate, none was ever
                     made.
                  In short, a donation which might have been converted into one of the noblest
                     charities was either, under a dozen pretexts, stolen outright, or frittered
                     away in such a manner as to answer in no respect the end of a benevolent
                     bequest.
                  It has been thus shown that most of the wealth of Macay became as dry leaves,
                     and was productive of nothing but disappointment, misery and, perhaps, his own
                     death. Let us see how it affected the character of his own legitimate
                     descendant.
               
               
                  A BRIGHT FIGURE IN A DARK GROUP.
                  The most interesting figure (said Judge R. N. Ogden, who made one of the most
                     eloquent appeals to the court during the celebrated trial.) in this dark group
                     of family portraits, was Eurydice, old Macay's daughter. Even in a complicated
                     suit like this, (continued the speaker,) one must speak for a moment of her
                     with tenderness and pity—with a sentiment of regret that so bright a spirit
                     should have had no congenial sphere for the development of her nature—that its
                     beauty should have been dulled and blurred by the heavily laden atmosphere of
                     vice by which she was surrounded. Eurydice had graduated at the old Ursuline
                     Convent, and appeared upon the scene as a lovely, amiable and impulsive girl,
                     about the time the life of her father was drawing to a close.
                  Even in the dry evidence of a legal report she figures as a girl of remarkable
                     beauty, distinguished for her quickness and vivacity, with no greater fault
                     than her impulsive, imprudent temperament. Poor Eurydice!—a struggle or series
                     of struggles is before you through life, and your best qualities will but
                      you to contend with the enemies with whom you will have to deal. The
                     manner in which her father had lived had affected, at her entrance into life,
                     Eurydice's position in society. A great many avoided receiving her on account
                     of the scandal after the death of her mother. Still her position as a brilliant
                     heiress attracted admirers of a showy and unscrupulous sort, and abundant
                     opportunity was not lacking for committing lifetime errors.
                  At thirteen years of age, Eurydice met with an adventurer to this country who
                     united in his person the usual shining qualities of a traveler with some that
                     were his own. Accident gave him an opportunity of performing one or two daring
                     exploits. It was at a day when during was greatly in vogue, and the visitor
                     (his name was Cordero) lived through a half a dozen encounters. Though they
                     were of the most desperate character, and conducted with no little ferocity,
                     Cordero had been generally the aggrieved party, and what, with a certain vein
                     of eccentricity he did not lack admirers. The most decided of these was
                     Eurydice, with her thirteen summers and her prospect for a large fortune. With
                     no wise counselors of her own sex, and indeed with none of any sort. Eurydice
                     was easily persuaded. She was wedded before she had scarcely become a
                     woman.
                  They had not been long married when Corderos' character began to appear more
                     than ever eccentric. He conducted himself with such violence that people
                     doubted whether to consider him a knave or a lunatic. He fought his seventh
                     duel, and it was long after remembered and talked of. Upon no previous occasion
                     had he expressed himself as satisfied where the option had been left to him; he
                     had conducted himself throughout such affairs with the most unrelenting
                     animosity.
                  But on the occasion now referred to, the two adversaries, after having been
                     placed in position were allowed, after the word was given, to advance and fire
                     at will, thus leaving the party who reserved his fire and who escaped the first
                     shot with the life of his antagonist in his hands.
                  In the present instance, Cordero's opponent had discharged his gun without
                     effect; the latter knowing his man, and covering his face with his hands, had
                     calmly awaited his fate. The spectacle had, however, failed to touch the heart
                     of Cordero; and he who had, hitherto, prided himself upon giving the first shot
                     or thrust now withheld fire until he had approached so near that there was
                     scarcely any possibility of missing, and then with the most violent Spanish
                     oaths, shot his antagonist deliberately through the heart.
                  The death of his opponent, who had been challenged in the first place, without
                     being to blame, caused great indignation against Cordero, (his own second,
                     Capt. John McClelland, refusing to approve his conduct,) and this irritation
                     against him was increased by the arrival in the city of a lady at this time,
                     who claimed to be Cordero's legal wife, in spite of his recent marriage.
                  Cordero was arrested upon this charge and tried before Judge Canonge for
                     polygamy. His friends and counsel saved him from conviction by showing that he
                     was under a commission of lunacy in the land of his birth, from which he had
                     never been relieved. Cordero fled the country, and Eurydice, before she had
                     fairly reached womanhood, found that her future had been shadowed by a
                     perspective fortune, which it was doubtful she would ever realize.
                  Cordero had been previously engaged in a partnership business in the city.
                     Several times when he had been absent, his wife had been placed under the
                     partner's care. Subsequently, (or previously, according to our witness,) when
                     he left the city, the acquaintance that had commenced between the wife and
                     partner, ripened into love. Eurydice was persuaded to consent to a secret
                     marriage, before it was ascertained what steps were necessary to dissolve her
                     contract with Cordero. The defect was a fatal one for her happiness. The second
                     husband, soon becoming wearied with his new wife, and the prospect of
                     inheriting any fortune by her appearing dubious, he subsequently, while absent
                     from the city, was openly married, without any regard to Eurydice's claims.
                  By this time the poor woman had began to regard her second marriage as invalid,
                     and with no longer much prospect either of wealth, hardly knew which way to
                     turn. Her situation was in reality so awkward and embarrassed that she was
                     finally compelled to resort to a third marriage, in order to avoid the
                     consequences of the two preceding. These marriages, it need hardly be stated,
                     led to various complications in the subsequent suit. The husband in the last
                     marriage was a philosophical Frenchman, who sometimes amused himself by trying
                     to study out the validity of his own claims to the hand of Eurydice, but who,
                     for any other purpose, thought the matter of but little consequence one way or
                     the other. The manner in which the marriage affected Eurydice was in giving her
                     the name of Nazaire and in causing her to become the mother of a daughter.
               
               
                  ANOTHER KALEIDOSCOPIC CHANGE.
                  Quoting from the analysis of the Supreme Court, the estate of Macay had been
                        disposed of in the three ways
                     referred to; that is to say, that the coiffeuse had acquired a valuable portion—the trustee for
                     charitable uses had accounted for the lion's share without opposition, and a
                     third part had gone to the rightful heir to the whole estate.
                  About the time of her last marriage, a new phase was given to the matter by a
                     large bequest of land, which came from a debtor of Macay, and who upon his
                     death-bed, as an act of conscience, made a restitution of property rightly due
                     Macay in his lifetime. This bequest directed that the money should be disposed
                     of in the manner provided for by Macay in his will. The effect of this bequest,
                     if carried out, would be to transfer the land donated (now become of great
                     value) to Corazon, for the charitable object already spoken of. A natural
                     supposition was that the charitable object would not be much more advanced
                     under the last legacy than it had been under the first. Nevertheless, a claim
                     for the whole bequest—daily becoming of increasing value—was promptly
                     interposed by Corazon, the nephew and eleemosynary trustee.
                  Meanwhile the time had passed with Eurydice when considerations for either the
                     reputation of her father or of her own were strong enough to prevent her from
                     asserting her rights. What still further contributed to provoke on her part a
                     desperate struggle was the fact that the income bequeathed her by her father's
                     will had in the last years never been paid. In case she offered any resistance,
                     or did not observe silence, a threat of declaring her marriages polygamous was
                     boldly made.
                  Thus originated the suit which has suggested this paper, and after that has
                     been said of the litigants it will not appear singular that disclosures of the
                     most startling character were made upon both sides.
                  It was tolerably well shown on one hand, by the evidence of Dr. Delery,
                     Brickell and Crawcour, that old Macay had been poisoned at his death, and the
                     weight of strong suspicion was made to rest upon his mistress and upon his
                     nephew. The estate had been plundered under a dozen different pretexts, and the
                     pretended disappearance of a large amount of the wealth, was shown to have been
                     caused by the trustee, who had meanwhile had the property conveyed secretly to
                     his own name and use.
                  On the other hand, it was contended that Eurydice was the illegitimate child of
                     old Macay; that she had been treated by her father during his life upon the
                     same footing with those children who wore known to be illegitimate; and that,
                     so far from being entitled to inherit the wealth in question, she deserved
                     rather to serve as a felon for having so many times been united illegally in
                     marriage. The suit was destined to occupy the rest of Eurydice's life, attack
                     her reputation where most sensitive, and deprive her of the few friends that
                     had thus far remained. The ill-gotten wealth of Macay had been her misfortune
                     through life—it had united her in three marriages, all more or less badly
                     assorted and difficult to be explained, and the fortune in expectancy had been
                     productive of nothing but chimeras and hopes never to be realized.
                  Eurydice's last years were spent in combatting and struggling, with a woman's
                     strength, against the foes by whom she was surrounded; sometimes gaining a
                     victory, sometimes meeting a defeat. In her old age she was not unfrequently
                     seen in company with a daughter who generally accompanied her in her flights
                     and migrations, and who, it was said, was much oftener seen in public offices,
                     and among rude and callous politicians, than in the proper sphere and society
                     of a young girl.
                  Upon the arrival here of Butler, both mother and daughter left the city, at the
                     time when a large portion of the population emigrated. Difficulties and
                     complications occurred in leaving, and one of the gossipping rumors of the day
                     was, that the honor of the daughter, Danae, had been compromised with a Federal
                     officer, or with the notorious John Molere.
                  The suit, however, had been too thoroughly grounded and the sum involved too
                     large to admit of any stay in the proceedings. It gained in intensity in spite
                     of the waning strength and increasing old age of Eurydice, and not even death
                     itself, it appeared, could stay it in its progress. The mother and daughter had
                     been meanwhile sometimes seen in large towns about well known hotels, figuring
                     in dubious twilight society, no one knowing in what way they subsisted, and
                     every one hearing a great many dreadful rumors, which each day gained in
                     number.
                  One of these was that the money realized from a Fair, and with which she had
                     been entrusted to carry from one city to another, had been mysteriously lost,
                     and another was that she had actually been caught with her hand in the pocket
                     of a suitor at the moment when upon his knees, he was offering his heart and
                     hand. Finally, the daughter's name (Danae) ceased to be mentioned at all, and
                     poor Eurydice, overwhelmed at what she saw was Danae's ruin, ceased to care for
                     the suit, and was slowly sinking in the grave. Nevertheless Eurydice remained
                     the daughter of a man who had died prosperous and rich, and so the dreadful
                     suit dragged on.
               
               
                  LAST SCENE.
                  But the end of all things comes at last. Their presiding honors have ordered in
                     the Supreme Court that judgment shall be entered up, and this fiat of the Court
                     of last appeal still stands as written. Eurydice and her daughter Danae have
                     won.
                  But the first named plaintiff, who theoretically has been present in court for
                     so many years, is at the time, in point of fact, absent from the halls of
                     justice.
                  Eurydice is dead. It was several months before that she had expired in
                     obscurity and want.
                  For the actual plaintiff (Danae) as such, has never had any actual existence.
                     She hardly remembers that it was instituted many years before by her mother,
                     and has never thought it worth while to communicate with lawyers. Still the
                     suit has been won, and counsel, after triumphing over other difficulties, can
                     overcome this also. Now that tardy fortune has conferred upon Danae wealth, it
                     is well to know where she is to be found.
                  Upon setting about the work of discovery, the task does not appear so easy. The
                     detectives must be called in, and even these are at fault. Visits must be paid
                     to obscure neighborhoods to the slums and backways of the city; to Basin,
                     Conti, Gallatin and Franklin streets; to the Widows' Row, the dancehouses, the
                     Triangle Buildings. Various witnesses are interrogated—Buffalo Bill—Hypolite,
                     Kate Townsend, Shanghai Mary, Black-and-Tan Lizzie, witnesses of one class and
                     witnesses of another; but for some time with not much success.
                  In the course of these inquiries it has been ascertained that the lucky heiress
                     has been arrested for the fiftieth time for being drunk and unable to take care
                     of herself; had been dragged through the streets by a couple of police officers
                     by her arms, with her long hair streaming in the wind; had been sent from the
                     station to the Recorder's presence, and from there in the Black Maria to the
                     Workhouse.
                  Still the search is not up yet. Danae has once again been liberated from the
                     workhouse, and the oldest detective in the service (Malone) undertakes to guess
                     where Danae is, and to conduct the friends, and counselors who have so
                     eloquently defended her case, to the exact locality where Macay's heiress is to
                     be found.
                  The hour happens to be midnight as he starts out as guide for his party, and
                     the road that the visitors traverse leads past the "Green-tree," "Shoemakers,"
                     "Stockholm," and similar well-known public houses. Finally he pauses in front
                     of a house whence the rude strains of an orchestra,
                     intermixed with the scuffling of fear, coarse love dittys, curses and
                     execrations proceed. The place sought is the paradise of thieves and desperate
                     characters of every nationality, who are turning day into night, or rather
                     turning everything into pandemonium. The roughest class of river men, sailors
                     and the floating population of the city, fast men and fast women, burglars and
                     cutthroats—the scum of every nation—are here holding high carnival and revel,
                     and it requires a charge of the police to effect an entrance. Is the party
                     named Danae—and who is better known by half a dozen aliases—in? Yes, she is in.
                     Let the distinguished visitors step forward. They are just in time. Another
                     moment would have, perhaps, been too late.
                  For there, stretched in the centre of the floor, with her mouth filled with
                     bloody foam, and bleeding at the nostrils lies the wretch they have been
                     seeking. In spite of a fever with which she had been almost delirious, she had
                     insisted upon leaving her bed, and in spite of disease and of the fact that she
                     had not drawn a sober breath for months except when under arrest, she had
                     insisted upon making her appearance. She has fallen, gasping and dying, upon
                     what was the principal scene of her infamous labors, and cannot now tell or
                     does not know what is the matter. She can only moan and press her hands upon
                     her breast, while the life-blood saturates her dress.
                  The distinguished visitors know not how to act—they can only occupy the stall
                     of the musicians, and the only use that the ill-gotten fortune of Macay to his
                     last surviving heir, is purchasing a rosewood coffin for the use of one who,
                     while living, had earned her bread by prostitution and crime.
               
            
            
               
               A QUESTION OF CHARACTER;
               OR, DIFFERENT WAYS OF SEEING IT.
               
                  I—A Commonplace View.
                  I attended at one of the Fairs of the last fortnight—though which one now, that
                     at Blaffer's or the one at Odd Fellows' I hardly remember, from accidents
                     subsequently to be related. The point I am now to dwell upon is that I there
                     met Tom Vanderside, who, by the way, is a character himself. Tom is notoriously
                     one of the best known men about town, half wag, half unscrupulous adventurer,
                     and possesses an amount of assurance that defies all bounds. His 
                        speciality
                        specialty
                      is to understand how to step forward and appear as the man for the
                     situation—to represent any idea or character that may be in request.
                  His eccentricities in this line are sometimes so irregular and of such an
                     exaggerated type as to place him and his friends in awkward situations. He,
                     upon one occasion, at a slimly attended theatrical performance, sneezed and
                     coughed in such a manner (though deeply interested in the scene,) as to
                     absolutely dishearten all of the performers. The manager had to come before the
                     curtain at the end of the first act and announce the unavoidable postponement
                     of the play. Upon another occasion his assurance was not so fortunate. He had
                     taken the liberty of presenting himself at a large house, which he happened to
                     be accidentally passing in company with a credulous friend, and at which a
                     large party was being given. His self-introduction this time had not at first
                     succeeded, and he with his friend, before he turned the incident to an
                     advantage, had to congratulate themselves upon not being turned over into the
                     hands of the police.
                  These past freaks of Tom I fully remembered when I found myself in his company
                     at the Fair, and it was with home suspicion and distrust that I timidly
                     followed his steps from one stall and booth to another. However, Tom was the
                     finest looking man there was in the room, with a face and figure that could
                     assume any thought or character, and he did not lack friends and admirers among
                     the fair.
                  At one of these stalls after calling for champagne punch, he was civil enough
                     to give me an introduction to a lady striking alike for the symmetry of her
                     face and form, and dressed in the most eblouissante of costumes. The name of the lady I was unable to
                     understand, and the manner in which she regarded my introducer led me at first
                     to suppose that he had never seen her before—that the introduction was one of
                     his customary jokes. However, the fair parti
                     did not seem offended. She met me in conversation half way, and in her tone a
                     singular mixture of sentiment and of hilarity (perhaps a little forced) was to
                     be detected. We were soon conversing with the ease of ordinary acquaintances.
                     In fact while thus engaged I was not a little astonished to discover that I had
                     actually chanced upon an old acquaintance—one entirely above the commonplace—an
                     eccentric character so queerly made up of ideal fancies and drawing-room
                     conventionalities as to put all description out of the question.
                  Of course in a moment Tom Vanderside was forgotten. We had become familiar—we
                     had become confidential. We conversed and ate ice-creams in friendly unison
                     behind the champagne fountain—behind the plates and dishes of the restaurant—we
                     promenaded through the rooms and upon the moonlit balcony. The whole scene
                     commenced to lose the ordinary commonplace outlines of a
                     fair. I had soon begun to assume the somewhat exaggerated tone of thinking of
                     the lady upon my arm. Once upon the balcony, and affected by the numberless
                     lights in-doors, the sounds of music and dancing from the hall, the gossamer
                     costumes of the other fair visitors, and the animation and fervid sentiment of
                     my companion, I found myself lifted into an imaginary world. My companion was
                     speaking of herself, with me for a listener, and at that moment the Princess
                     Scherezade, in her thousand and second story, would not have possessed more
                     interest.
                  I had come to the Fair with Tom Vanderside, and had proposed to amuse myself in
                     his company. But I was now too much interested in the animated conversation of
                     my new acquaintance to give him any further thoughts. Her story, for she told
                     me one of herself of the wildest and most fantastic character, became
                     subsequently so blended with what I saw, that I shall attempt giving it
                     below—though necessarily without any of that weirdness of tone or grotesquerie
                     of style that formed so striking a feature of the original narrative:
               
               
                  
                  II.—An Ideal Estimate—The Princess Scherezade.
                  "I do not believe myself superstitious; but there must be days when the
                     guardian angel, who ordinarily shields us from temptation, abandons his post,
                     and leaves the threshold of our hearts open to whatever malignant spirits may
                     choose to enter. The German superstition of the Walpurgis Night, when wicked
                     demons are supposed to be abroad and hold full sway over the mind, is, I am
                     convinced, founded on a true insight into our nature.
                  "I went one evening—oh, to me, ever memorable night—to a performance at this
                     Opera. The day had been overcast and stormy, and my spirits had conformed to
                     the weather. I had found myself in that humor when you regard with sullen
                     discontent your most sacred principles of action; when you feel like yielding
                     to every capricious impulse, when your pulse beats high and you are tired of
                     your best friends: and, above all, tired of the commonplace. I was doubly
                     unfortunate, in that I was called upon to take an important step, and the
                     decision you muse when thus situated is nearly always the wrong one. I was the
                     betrothed of a worthy man, who had long loved me; the union promised everything
                     that was not denied by my own wayward character. I had as much feeling for my
                     intended as I had for any one. But the truth is, I had never known, with the
                     exception just mentioned, what the grande
                        passion was—I had never loved anybody.
                  "To dissipate my doubts, dispel my black rumors, and at any rate put off my
                     decision until the morrow, I determined, in spite of the weather, to go to the
                     Opera.
                  "I found the house crowded—perhaps with people whom came there, like me, to
                     escape from themselves. The performance was 'Robert le Diable.' I was soon
                     painfully interested in the weird music—the supernatural machinery—the ghosts,
                     goblins and infernal train which figure in this well-known play—perhaps from
                     the power of the music, perhaps from the predisposition to which I have just
                     alluded. At any rate, at the end of one of the acts, when the curtain fell, I
                     almost felt that the performance I had witnessed was a reality.
                  "My amour-propre and the world around me soon
                     awakened another train of reflection. I occupied a proscenium box. I was
                     well-dressed, and—perhaps I had better say it at once—I was thought pretty. I
                     certainly was accustomed to incense, and it did not surprise me to find a great
                     many glasses directed toward me. As I am telling you precisely the state of the
                     case, and do not pretend to be superior to the weaknesses of my sex, I ought to
                     admit that the anticipation of this œillade
                     had probably also affected my decision in braving the weather. At any rate, I
                     felt for a moment my triumph to be complete. Surrounded by beauty, I yet had no
                     rivals, and to be admired for beauty alone is no mean homage. Indeed I doubt
                     whether, after all, in the triumphs your sex can achieve, there can be any
                     equal to that of a woman, shining in the full eclat of her loveliness, with worshipers intoxicated as much by
                     her presence itself, as the music they applaud.
                  "To think of my appearance, suggested in my mind at the time a train of
                     consequences—whether I was destined to meet any one who would exercise over my
                     will a life-time spell. Putting the question in the most practical manner, I
                     set my imagination to work, and began to conjure up some organization that
                     might possess qualities and perfections the most alluring. I gave him a man's
                     strength, and a woman's delicacy of feature and softness. I even busied myself
                     with the color of his eyes, his complexion, his attitude and general
                     expression. By the time, I had completed the traits of my Frankenstein, he had
                     become palpable to my eyes, indeed, so openly and evidently visible was my
                     creation to my sight, that I finally came to see him as clearly as I could see
                     anything. Perhaps it was the infernal or supernatural character of the music
                     which had affected me, or it may have been my nerves, or a diseased state of my
                     mind—at any rate, I soon began to fancy that the figure had discovered me and
                     was bending on me the full glance of his eyes. A moment more and his gaze had
                     become to me audible—no need for us the dull medium of words—our minds were
                     already en rapport. 'Let me come to you,' I
                     seemed to hear him say; souls like ours have no need of the dull formality of
                     introductions.' I whispered 'Come;' but the next moment, smiling at my folly,
                     rubbed my eyes. When I looked again the figure had disappeared. 'There are no
                     such beings,' I sighed, 'as exist in a fond woman's fancy;' and, trying to
                     dispel the illusion, I endeavored to find amusement in other parts of the
                     house.
                  "Scarcely had I resolved upon doing so, when a figure passed in the rear of my
                     box which caused to run through my frame an involuntary tremor—a feeling
                     similar to that which one is said to experience when an enemy treads over what
                     will be your grave. The gentleman who attended me arose, exchanged a word with
                     the new comer, and gave him his seat. In the agitation I was in, I could not
                     tell whether he had been formally presented or not; at any rate, the being whom
                     I had taken for it creation of my fancy was now seated at my side.
                  "It took me a few minutes to recover from emotion, during which time my strange
                     visitor was speaking of the ordinary subjects of conversation without appearing
                     to be aware of my embarrassment. He spoke easily and gracefully, as with a mind
                     stored with information, of the opera in various countries, the comparative
                     merits of the most celebrated of living prime
                        donne, and was evidently familiar with the manners and customs of
                     different races. His address was so agreeable that I soon had recovered
                     sufficient assurance to inquire:
                  "'Have we ever met before this evening?'
                  "'It is not many months since I landed on this continent for the first
                     time.'
                  "His answer, I noticed, admitted the apparent impossibility of our ever having
                     met before, and yet abstained from saying so.
                  "'Still your face is familiar. I could almost suppose, were it not for its
                     absurdity, that we had met in another state of being. My conversation I give
                     you leave to find singular (here I laughed almost hysterically) for a first
                     meeting.'
                  "Your remark is by no means absurd—you only express an idea about which
                     philosophers have always battled, and concerning which, in our present
                     relations to science, and in our ignorance of the unknown shadowy world that
                     surrounds us, it is impossible to know anything certain. Nevertheless what you
                     mention so hesitatingly I believe to be a matter of fact. I might relate many
                     incidents which would seem to you strange.'
                  "I have said, I think, sufficient to show the influence and hold my strange
                     companion had upon me, though perhaps without satisfactorily explaining its
                     origin. I do not think he remained at my side more than half an hour and yet it
                     seemed to me a long duration of time. As when the brain is under the influence
                     of certain narcotics, the passage of years seem compressed into the space of
                     moments. But at the end of that time he arose, and telling me that we would
                     meet again soon, he disappeared from my view. I watched him as he left me, and
                     heard his descending footsteps, and instead of listening to the performance, I
                     set myself to work to analyze my feelings and endeavor if possible to regain my
                     connection with the world around me.
                  "But let me first attempt to give you some idea of the way in which I had been
                     affected by the being who had just left me.
                  "You are perhaps a profound observer of men—at any rate you imagine so—and have
                     but little confidence in descriptions of character which abound in mystery. You
                     regard them as so many Byronic impossibilities, which have disappeared along
                     with ghosts and fairies and other exploded chimeras of the past.
                  "Nevertheless, I contend that there are in life such people—men who vanish and
                     flit about without any one knowing the why and wherefore—who look as if they
                     had lived a thousand years, and who yet seem endowed with perpetual youth—men
                     who are shadowy and indistinct in all of their relations, walking enigmas,
                     perambulating sphinxes. It is not difficult, seeing them, to imagine that you
                     have before you the Wandering Jew, Mephistophiles, the discoverer of the hidden
                     Elixir, or of the talismans of Solomon, who have sold themselves to the Evil
                     One, or who have done any other conceivable act to separate themselves from
                     human sympathy. There was about this man something of all this, which
                     frightened and subdued me, and which, perhaps, I need hardly say, made a too
                     strong impression upon my imagination.
                  "Altogether, what with the emotions of the day, the effect of the play, my
                     meeting with this man, I was in a state of agitation and excitement such as I
                     have never experienced before or since. I could only recur to his parting
                        words and wonder how they were to be realized—when and
                     where was I again to meet him. Suddenly I remembered an assembly to which I had
                     been invited; 'perhaps he will be there,' I said, and without understanding
                     what I did, or why I did it, I signified my desire to leave to my escort, and,
                     once out of the opera, ordered my carriage to drive to the place in
                     question.
                  "The night was assuredly the blackest in the calendar. As I rode the thunder
                     pealed and the lightning fell. One vivid flash suddenly illumined the street.
                     It was only momentary, but by it I thought I saw the figure of the unknown
                     around whom the folks seemed to play as if in some way influenced by him. But
                     on searching the house I was induced to think that I had been mistaken, as I
                     found that he had preceded me.
                  "What passed afterwards I hardly know. There was an intoxication of the senses,
                     of some overmastering will; but it was from love—which scarcely made me
                     accountable for my actions; which hurried on from one phase of feeling to
                     another; which made me, if not unconscious, at least uncontrollable by the
                     looks and thoughts of my friends who surrounded me.
                  "It was toward morning when the wax-tapers burnt low in their sockets, and the
                     flowers withered on the head, and the color faded from the
                     cheeks of beauty, that there came the crisis of my fate. A dance was about to
                     be performed, at that time a novelty in our fashionable world, and which much
                     resembled the Tarantula or the Danza de la Seduxion. As its name suggests, it
                     was a dance which delineated, in a sort of pantomime, the advances of the
                     suitor, the coquetry of the lady and her final consent to his suit, which is
                     signified by the dropping of a bouquet from her hands into his.
                  "On any other occasion, I should never have listened to a proposal for a moment
                     for taking part in a performance which, according to our notions of propriety,
                     causes a young lady to appear in attitudes inconsistent with the dignity of her
                     sex. As it was, it was the voice of only half of my soul, and I would gladly
                     have refused if I had known how. Though I could not resist, I struggled; for,
                     from the moment he whispered his request in my ear and touched my unwilling
                     hand, I felt that my fate, through all time, was being irretrievably
                     decided.
                  "Meanwhile the music had commenced, and we had taken our position. The coyness,
                     the unwillingness to be led on, which was part of my role in the first part of
                     the dance, I perhaps performed all the better from my shrinking from the
                     position altogether. But the ardor of the lover redoubles—it soon seemed to me
                     impossible to resist. My head was turning, the spectators began to appear like
                     mocking fiends who, seeking the devouring whirlpool, into which I was drifting,
                     yet abstained from assisting me. The music grows more giddy, his ardent gaze is
                     already fixed on the bouquet which I tremblingly clutch in my hands. Is there
                     no hand to stay me—pity me kind Heaven, and let not these emblems of innocence
                     be the seal of my perdition! One more gasp—my partner is bending on one
                     knee—has clasped my hand and seeks to fix my gaze. I could read in his eyes
                     more eloquently than if described by word: 'Be mine; cease struggling' My limbs
                     were trembling under me.
                  "I gave one lingering glance around the room. The moment after the flowers had
                     fallen from my hand as if by their own weight.
                  "I had given my consent. Henceforth I was powerless to struggle."
                  My companion paused for breath, or as if at a loss how further to proceed.
                  "And you were married?" I ventured to stammer, disgusted at the turn things had
                     taken. The fact was my own heart had begun to be a little affected.
                  "No; but I am his betrothed—his affianced bride; and this very night—"
                  Her further speech was interrupted by the appearance of Vanderside.
               
               
                  III.—A Dissolving View.
                  Tom's manner had about it an affected dignity, coldness and formality, which,
                     in the absence of any other reason to account for it, I was uncharitable enough
                     to attribute to punch.
                  "I am not indiscreet in interrupting you," said Tom in the tone of a Monte
                     Christo. At the same moment he extended his elbow at that angle which plainly
                     meant that the lady I was with was to take this arm.
                  "On the contrary; permit me to politely assure you you are interrupting a most
                     romantic narrative."
                  "One polite assurance merits another; permit me to suggest that I feel inclined
                     to go home."
                  "In that case, Tom, follow your own inclination—by all means, go."
                  "You interrupted me a moment too soon; I was about to tell you that the lady
                     you have upon your arm is my betrothed—my intended. You must admit that your
                     two hours conversation at the first meeting—'
                  "I was too stupified to hear the conclusion of his sentence. Before I had
                     recovered my surprise the lady in question had disappeared in the direction of
                     the dressing-room.
                  "And you tell me you are engaged to marry her," I muttered to myself rather
                     than inquired of him.
                  "The ceremony, in confidence, will be performed to-night. There are no legal
                     impediments, so far as I know."
                  "Have you ever appeared in the role of the Wandering Jew?"
                  "It is possible."
                  
                  "Are you a vampire?"
                  "I am particular about my dishes; but the food you refer to—"
                  "Are you possessed of the necromantic—the talismans of Solomon—art?—the power
                     of influencing people against their will? How in the deuce, in short, did you
                     come to be engaged?"
                  Vanderside laughed the laugh of one possessed of a superior intelligence. "I
                     see what you are driving at," he said with an explanatory air. "My fiancee has
                     evidently been giving you an account of our courtship, and, like every other
                     woman, she naturally likes to have a slight coloring of romance attached to an
                     event of so much importance. That shows the different ways that events affect
                     different people. Every woman would perhaps tell you a story about her lover
                     similar to what you have heard to-night, were she to tell you what she really
                     thinks after drinking two or three glasses of punch such as they sell at
                     fairs.
                  "The simple facts, however, are that I met her one night by blundering in her
                     box at the opera, and for a time supposed her to be somebody else. We met
                     accidently two or three times the same night, and what you would set down to my
                     impudence, the truer insight of a woman rightly construed into more superhuman
                     attributes. I am a good looking fellow, and the struggle between her love at
                     first sight for me and her regard for the proprieties explains all of the rest.
                     But she is coming—not a word. So long as she is willing to surround our
                     nuptials with a demoniacal glamour it will be as good a way of keeping up
                     discipline as any other."
                  "But people sometimes make discoveries; she may not like it perhaps when she
                     comes to find out her mistake—that she was under a momentary infatuation. The
                     sex are capable of revenge."
                  "I shall think up some new character before that misfortune arrives. At any
                     rate, I shall not have the politeness to step from my pedestal until she
                     discovers for herself that I am not a hero."
                  Tom extended his hand and the smile of superior intelligence beamed over his
                     face. As he bade me adieu the sound of a carriage was heard below, and looking
                     from the gallery the figure of the Scherezade of the hour before was discovered
                     entering the carriage, entering too with one whom I subsequently discovered was
                     the former suitor whom Tom had so far eclipsed. In fact, why make a short story
                     long? Scherezade's marriage did suddenly take place that night, and Tom
                     Vanderside—who had affected a clever woman for one evening with a power as of
                     fascination, who had made her almost believe he was Mephistopheles, or some
                     supernatural character—found that he had been thrown into the shade by his more
                     prosaic rival. The natural attachment of slow growth asserted its power, or
                     perhaps a suspicion was awakened in her mind that Tom's powers were of a
                     superficial character. At any rate, the bridegroom that led Scherezade to the
                     altar was the former lover, and not Tom Vanderside.
               
            
            
               MADELINE.
               A STORY OF THE RIVER COAST.
               
                  I. Departure.
                  Those who knew the late Capt. Destrehan will remember him as a cynic of a
                     pleasant type. He amused himself with laughing at the follies of men, and in
                     placing his friends in situations which would compel them to show the baser
                     clay of which they were composed. His studies of character would have looked
                     like harmless practical jokes, had not their uniform denouement argued a little
                     malice against the whole human race.
                  It was in some such mood that he one day summoned his nephew, a sleek and
                     well-fed young man, to his presence, and inquired if he had never thought about
                     marrying.
                  "I am only twenty-one," answered Anthony Destrehan, the youth in question, "and
                     had never given the subject the thought which it perhaps demands. However, I
                     have already a half a dozen angelic creatures in view, with whom one might
                     perhaps live happily. If you, therefore, think it necessary to look at
                     others—"
                  "You are right; it is necessary that you look the second time."
                  "In that case I will hunt up a seventh party to see what can be
                     accomplished."
                  "On the contrary, you need do nothing of the sort. I have saved you that
                     trouble. The lady is already at hand."
                  "But in case there should be difficulties?"
                  "In case you decline, or in case you do not show yourself sufficiently
                     interesting to captivate her fancy and with it her hand, it will be your
                     misfortune. In that case, you had better think how you are henceforth to manage
                     to live."
                  "And when am I to see the lady—when am I to make any election, or rather my
                     matrimonial essay?"
                  "Not for a few weeks to come. At present I propose to use your talents in a
                     different manner. I believe you pretend to have been going through a course of
                     legal studies?"
                  "You forget. I have been recently called to the bar."
                  "What I wish you then to do is to act as my agent in making inquiries about a
                     plantation a few hundred miles up the river. It is the old Bagniere
                     estate."
                  "Have no fears—I shall purchase it for you."
                  "You will do nothing of the sort. You are to go to the place itself, and simply
                     make a report. Write an accurate description of the outhouses, number of acres
                     and similar details—see how many mortgages are recorded, and gather information
                     of a useful character."
                  "The task, mon oncle, will be easy—never
                     fear."
                  "In that case pack your trunk and leave by the next steamer."
                  "C'est entendu."
                  "Once you have completed your survey, you are to return forthwith. If you have
                     shown yourself discreet, upon your arrival in the city we will then proceed to
                     discuss the question of marriage."
                  Capt. Destrehan made his nephew a nod, as an indication that the interview was
                     ended, and the latter having responded in atone of airy gaiety, made a formal
                     and respectful salute.
                  "I wonder what mischief that uncle of mine means me now," thought the nephew,
                     as he made his preparations. "Whatever result happens, will be tolerably sure
                     to encounter his malice." However, he went on board of the boat that afternoon,
                     and at a little after 5 o'clock was on his way up the river.
               
               
                  II—The Coast.
                  The boat upon which young Destrehan had embarked, like most of those in use
                     upon the Mississippi, was fitted up with an extraordinary regard for elegance
                     and comfort, and he found no want of occupation in regarding the endless
                     succession of charming villas which adorned either shore.
                  Still the most picturesque or magnificent scenery will after awhile tire, and
                     Destrehan soon began to look around for a companionship among the other guests.
                     Chance favored him.
                  At one of the meals to which he sat down, a gentleman occupied a seat adjoining
                     that of Destrehan, whom the latter had already remarked. The stranger had the
                     manners of a man of society, though Destrehan did not quite like his face.
                     There was an expression in it half hypocritical, half timid. In some side
                     remark that he chanced to make, and which gave offence to a third traveler,
                     Destrehan had observed that he had had but little response to make, and had
                     allowed him almost to become involved in a quarrel without coming to his
                     support.
                  Still he seemed disposed to talk, and the ordinary commonplaces of travelers
                     were exchanged. He ordered a bottle of wine, and something like animation began
                     to be imparted to the conversation.
                  The stranger, who appeared to have been a traveler, expressed himself moat
                     readily in finding fault with everything he saw around him. He first commenced
                     by sneering at the dinner:
                  "Here, you see, is a country that has every variety of flesh and game: only
                     they cook every dish in the same way. I have a growing presentment," he said,
                     as he ordered a second supply of fish, "that I shall die of starvation."
                  "Steamboat fare is generally rather popular," said Destrehan.
                  "One must eat something," said the stranger, as he entrenched himself with a
                     circle of dishes. "The cooking we get will be the death of me; but one never
                     knows how to die gracefully. And the liquors!" Here he emptied mechanically his
                     glass.
                  "Bad, certainly," said Destrehan; "but it disappears. Another bottle,
                     waiter."
                  The last remark made his companion confidential dential. The two travelers exchanged cards. The
                     name of the stronger proved to be Caskie.
                  "How much farther do your travels lead you?" inquired Destrehan. "I get off at
                     the Bagniere place."
                  "What, the old plantation chateau which is just on ahead?"
                  "I imagine you describe the place rightly."
                  Caskie gave him a cool, scrutinizing look, as much as to inquire what was the
                     object of his visit, but he merely added:
                  "I am bound for the same place. I see we are destined to be thrown
                     together."
                  "About our landing—will the Captain—"
                  "There will be no trouble. I have already spoken about that, and the boat will
                     soon round to. I believe the deckhands are already making ready with the
                     gangway. We had better look after our baggage."
                  They were soon out on shore, and Caskie having left Destrehan the privilege of
                     rewarding the porter for his trouble, and having placed the trunks in the care
                     of a servant who came down, the two walked toward the house.
                  "I see the chimneys of the sugar house," said Destrehan, "but where is the
                     residence?"
                  "That is hid behind the dense grove of orange trees. The house is an old
                     affair, and was built as long ago as the Spanish occupation. I am glad you are
                     along with me," said Caskie, who looked as if he was trying to turn his now
                     acquaintance to advantage.
               
               
                  III—The Plantation Chateau.
                  It was near nightfall is the guests appeared in front of the door. Destrehan
                     felt a 
                        presentment
                        presentiment
                     , of something, he hardly knew what, in entering. While waiting upon
                     the verandah steps for some one to appear, he remarked a very pretty hand,
                     covered with diamonds, which rested upon the sill of one of the upper
                     windows.
                  Soon after, in answer to their summons, Mme. Gilbaux, by which name Destrehan
                     understood their hostess to be called, welcomed them at the door. Caskie, who
                     had apparently visited the house before upon business, formally presented him.
                     The open and sincere welcome which one receives in the country followed.
                  "The letter which preceded you tells me you come on business," said the
                     hostess. "In the country we are little troubled with guests. Your visit must,
                     therefore, be one of pleasure."
                  The guests replied in the same spirit, and a servant led the way to the rooms
                     which had been placed at their disposition.
                  "By the way," said Caskie, as they mounted the stairs together, "it is not
                     about the sale of the property—."
                  "Something very near it; a glance at its value, title deeds, etc., is the
                     object of my visit."
                  "Oh, it is," said Caskie, a little embarrassed. "The fact is that I happen to
                     have one or two mortgages—it ought to be your first care to examine into
                     them."
                  Destrehan had begun to be amazed at the sharp way in which his new acquaintance
                     looked after his own interest.
                  "Are these mortgages old?"
                  "They have been hanging on since Butler's time," said Caskie.
                  "And the object of your visit is to look after these?"
                  "You are right—at I least partly, that."
                  "You appear very much at home here," said Destrehan. "Where is M. Gilbaux?"
                  "Well, you won't see much of him—he sits about on the back portico—his
                     influence is felt in the yearly settlement of accounts. I see they have given
                     us a double room, and our trunks are already up there. Be alive there, Joe, (to
                     the Servant,) and get the locks open as quick as you can. Can you make a guess
                     as to how soon supper will be ready?"
                  "There's no need of that question," said Destrehan. "We can see the kitchen,
                     and preparations are already on foot."
                  "You are right, and we had better lose no time in dressing."
                  Before the operation had been completed the bell had sounded. Caskie led the
                     way and placed himself at the head of the table. Mme. Gilbaux was already at
                     the opposite end.
                  For some moments after being seated, Caskie defrayed the expenses of
                     conversation, or was the principal talker. He carved and criticised the dishes
                     and disparaged the servants.
                  "This Caskie seems most infernally at home here," thought Destrehan. "That
                     mortgage of his evidently gives him privileges."
                  Whatever may have been his manner, it did not affect the spirits of their
                     host.
                  Destrehan now regarded attentively her hand. It did not appear to be the one
                     the sparkle of whose diamonds had first attracted his attention.
                  The moment after his glance of inquiry, an addition was made to their number.
                     It was a lady who entered, and Mme. Gilbaux introduced the last comer as her
                     daughter Madeline. She bowed to Destrehan, but did not again look in his
                     direction.
                  Destrehan bestowed one glance to see if the diamonds were all there, and then
                     remembered the advice of his uncle.
               
               
                  IV.—Introduction.
                  The meal finished, Mme. Gilbaux accepted Destrehan's arm, and the two
                     promenaded upon the verandah.
                  Caskie placed himself in a lazy attitude upon the railings, and disposed
                     himself to smoke a cigar. Miss Madeline the daughter, stood near him with a
                     match, and appeared to derive pleasure in watching his movements and the
                     wreaths of smoke. As she stood, her hand rested on his arm.
                  "This won't do," said Caskie, "wasting time here; where's Mr. Gilbaux? Time's
                     money."
                  As if he knew already, without awaiting any answer, he started, without further
                     ceremony, to leave the party. Mme. Gilbaux, however, begged Destrehan to excuse
                     her absence, and took C.'s arm. The pendency of the mortgage Destrehan readily
                     guessed to be the cause of her absence.
                  Miss Madeline, left alone with Destrehan, led the way to the parlor. Her guest
                     followed discreetly behind.
                  "Her figure," he thought, "is extremely a la
                        mode, though rather too erect and statuesque. She appears to be
                     very reserved and cold." He attempted to converse. He was answered in French
                     and found difficulty in persuading her to abandon the use of that language.
                  "I shall clearly not make a very dangerous impression upon the daughter," he
                     thought. "I should like to know why she never looked at one; or if by chance
                     you happen to catch her eyes why her glance is always shadowy and evanescent. I
                     wish the mother would return."
                  Not quite sure of what would be his success, under the circumstances, or
                     attempting to entertain with conversation, Destrehan at the first opportunity
                     begged to hear her at the piano. "You will find me," he said, "the most patient
                     and pleased of listeners."
                  Miss Madeline gave a glance full of vivacity.
                  "You have prepared your mind for the worst. It would perhaps be cruelty to put
                     your patience and easily pleased sense of hearing to the test."
                  "I shall endeavor to be critical if I can in this way better hope to
                     please."
                  "No, not that; a fair compromise would be to listen without troubling your mind
                     with thinking of compliments at the close of the performance. Have you any
                     preference?"
                  "I promise in advance to be pleased at any thing—that is if I am not too
                     good-natured or patient."
                  She now played, without regard to the last speech, a brilliant morceau. In her
                     attitudes and quick glances from the notes to the piano, all of her coldness
                     had disappeared. Her manner was so instinct with life that Destrehan thought,
                     in seeing her, of some wild animal suddenly brought under restraint. The
                     expression of some such grotesque thought was written on his face.
                  "My playing has not pleased."
                  "On the contrary—"
                  "Do you play yourself, Mr. Destrehan?"
                  "Yes, Miss Madeline."
                  At that moment, Mme. Gilbaux entered, and Miss Madeline,, under cover of this
                     entry, withdrew.
               
               
                  V—An Impression.
                  When Destrehan awoke the next morning, the sight of a small glove lying upon
                     his dressing table brought Miss Madeline to his mind.
                  "She must have occupied this room before my coming," he thought. "And this lace
                     work and stays—as I live, it is a corset. It has enclosed a pretty figure."
                  Destrehan looking out of his window at that moment saw a carriage at the door,
                     and encountered the glance of Miss Madeline preparing to go out. Determined
                     henceforth to give no cause of complaint he hastened to offer his assistance in
                     helping her to enter. But Caskie happened to be passing at the same moment, and
                     her hand was given to him, though he had made no attempt to take it.
                  "At the rate," he remarked, "at which we are going, we are likely to know less
                     of each other than when first introduced."
                  Destrehan, through timidity, kept out of the way until evening. Not to appear
                     ill-natured or offended, he exerted himself to give an air of animation to the
                     conversation. There was other company in the parlor, too, at that hour, and it
                     was impossible to avoid meeting Miss Madeline. Once, while promenading with
                     her, she made the following statement:
                  "My education has been of the most absurd character. I am almost ashamed to
                     speak of those accomplishments at which I most excel. My father has been
                     disappointed in having a daughter instead of a son. In revenge he has caused me
                     to bestow attention upon pursuits which are sometimes of doubtful value in your
                     sex, and of none whatever in ours. I have for instance learned to fire a gun or
                     pistol with some accuracy. I am vain of my skill on horseback, but as I grow
                     older I become ashamed to have to admit that I have wasted so much time."
                  "And you have always remained here?"
                  "Subsequently mama came to the conclusion that my education was not greatly
                     progressing. I was then sent to a convent. There they finished me off, and I
                     have returned. I have learned to say prunes and prisms."
                  Destrehan was beginning almost to like his new acquaintance. He asked her hand
                     for the waltz. She refused his request coldly. A moment after she explained
                     that she was engaged.
                  "Would you like to have me find your partner?"
                  "Yes; it is Mr. Caskie."
                  "Your partner is a gentleman of good taste. He compliments himself I observe,
                     so far as to dance only with you."
                  "Yes, he wishes to pretend that I am the only lady present who waltzes
                     well."
                  "I would have made the same statement if it would have entitled me to the same
                     privilege."
                  "Privilege! You are right. He is my cousin, and I give my cousin
                     privileges."
                  Destrehan, secretly exasperated to the last degree, found it no easy task to
                     look amiable for the rest of the evening.
               
               
                  VI—Denouement.
                  Not wishing, after the last conversation, to be annoyed or betray any feeling
                     one way or the other, he contrived to miss seeing Madeline at breakfast, and
                     subsequently occupied himself in the library, in examining the title deeds to
                     the estate.
                  The parlor door was open. The faint sounds of music, which emanated from Miss
                     Madeline's hands, distracted Destrehan's attention. The notes trickled from her
                     fingers like drops of falling water. These, in turn, would be followed by
                     little bursts of melody that excited his blood like a fever.
                  In this mood, a servant delivered a message at the door. Miss Madeline
                     complained of ennui, her compliments, and
                     begged that Mr. Destrehan would desist for once from his labors.
                  Destrehan sent a discreet message, but remained away.
                  The servant soon returned. He must come. Madeline wished to practice a duet and
                     required his resistance. A second excuse was pleaded, but this time more
                     faintly.
                  By this time he was indisposed for labor. He lit a cigar, and, in a half
                     reclining attitude, amused himself with reading a novel.
                  While surrounded with a dense volume of smoke, he was suddenly awakened from
                     his revery by seeing Miss Madeline standing with folded arms over his chair.
                     She was regarding him coolly. "Your business is of a very exacting nature."
                  Destrehan arose to his feet and attempted an explanation.
                  "What is it that you wish to accomplish?" she inquired.
                  "I thought myself simply too uninteresting to inflict my company upon
                     others."
                  "What else?"
                  "That we are not destined to be very good friends—that we had better let each
                     other alone."
                  Madeline gazed at him angrily.
                  "Do you wish to avoid me?"
                  "Yes."
                  "I shall not be so, Mr. Destrehan."
                  He gave a look of inquiry, and saw that her cheek was burning with emotion of
                     some sort.
                  "You are to make yourself agreeable. You are to ride with me on horseback—to
                     accompany me in a boat, and to listen to my guitar when I wish to
                        sail. You shall be near me under the long shadows of the
                     cypress. Do you suppose that, having you here in this house all alone, I do not
                     intend to have my way?"
                  "I should like to fathom the motive for her conduct," he thought. "That cynic
                     uncle must have known this girl, and known that once in her company I would
                     have committed a folly, one way or the other. But who that saw her coldness and
                     reserve a few days ago, could have suspected such subtlety and finesse?"
               
               
                  VII.—Ambrosia.
                  The succeeding week was the happiest of Destrehan's life. Caskie had gone up
                     the river for a few days. Destrehan and Madeline were alone. He shut his eyes
                     to what was beyond, and sighed only that time could not remain stationary.
                  Madeline, at his first interview, had only seemed to him a handsome women of
                     fine physique, with a little more than ordinary in intelligence. He now
                     regarded her as one of those gorgeous types of beauty which enervates— which intoxicates. Each day. she
                     acquired an additional charm; her face burned with a deeper glow. In her eyes
                     was a dreamy expression, and about the iris was a transparent light. His
                     happiness was of repose, and not of hysteric mirth—akin rather to melancholy.
                     He was wondering how long his elysium, his delirium would last—whether it would
                     ripen into love, and whether any expression would not dispel it forever.
                  But as the hours slipped away each had a growing foreboding that they were but
                     at child's play. It affected the two in different ways. It made Destrehan
                     indisposed for occupation of any sort. The more Madeline saw the end of the
                     folly the more she abandoned herself to it for the time being. She was no
                     longer contented to remain seated at her music, or sewing, with her head
                     pensively inclined to one side. Ever in motion, she would move quickly about
                     the house, the little heels to her slippers making a music to which Destrehan
                     never grew tired of listening.
                  But one day she had sat down upon a footstool near, while the latter read her
                     the poems of Abbe Rouquette, of our city, then much admired. Destrehan remarked
                     at the time that Madeline was very prettily dressed. Her black hair, rippled to
                     the back part of her head, was momentarily confined by an ivory comb, but soon
                     broke through this impediment into a cascade of glossy curls. She wore a simple
                     white dress, and from this her still whiter shoulders were escaping like a
                     delicate bud from its imprisoning calyx. Seated upon her stool, her hands
                     clasped around her knee, a delicate slipper unconsciously appeared beneath the
                     folds of her dress. Madeline wistfully regarded him.
                  "You appear in an elevated mood, Madeline. You are above me in the clouds. Tell
                     me, who remain behind upon the dull earth, what you have been idealizing
                     about?"
                  "I have been making my future to order—creating the most rosy of all
                     existences, and banishing dull care altogether." She continued on in this vein
                     until her expression became radiant, her gestures vehement, and until she had
                     infused some of her own feeling into his more apathetic nature. Madeline had a
                     charming way of carrying her diminutive little hands half behind her that was
                     sufficient of itself to banish all philosophical composure.
                  "But where do you get so much animation, Madeline? Have you a superior
                     organization that derives health and glow from an atmosphere that effects me
                     with languor? Be a little composed. I cannot become lively, but you may become
                     less vivacious. Near you I am the heavy pack horse beside Pegasus. You are
                     anxious to tell me something: or is it that you wish to fold me in your arms
                     and have not the courage? I shall never feel composed in your presence. If you
                     passed near me when asleep, my dreams would be disturbed. There is no telling
                     what you would do to me if you found me asleep. Would you kiss me?"
                  "If you continue to make me such speeches you will never have to dread such a
                     misfortune."
                  "My business is finished in your mother's house, Madeline. I have remained here
                     too long, and the next steamer that passes must take me to the city."
                  "But that passes to-night. But, stay at least until Mr. Caskie returns. When
                     that happens, I am to visit the city under his charge. My trunks are already
                     packed, and everything in readiness."
                  "The next boat must carry me away, Madeline. And this leads me to say that it
                     is a mistake about our never knowing when we are happy. I have been happy
                     almost every moment of the past week. Conscious of my happiness at the time.
                     Still it was slightly marred. I did not believe it would last. I must awake
                     from the atmosphere in which you have transported me, to the duller
                     realities."
                  "Dream a little longer—I will strew your couch with fresh flowers. N'eveillez-vous pas de
                     endormi."
                  "But, Madeline, now that I think of it, tell me something of Caskie."
                  Her face became pale. The name was obviously connected with her thoughts—with
                     what had already been shadowed forth in the troubled expression of her
                     face.
                  "Tell you something of him—he is my cousin," she said slowly.
                  "But I know that, already."
                  "Is that all you know?"
                  "You have never told me there was anything more to know."
                  "He is my fiance—my intended."
                  "You are jesting—I do not understand."
                  "He is the gentleman whom mama has picked out to marry me."
                  Destrehan had the moment before felt near Madeline as a fire-worshiper would
                     have in the presence of the sun. At the last words a shadow as of an
                     imperceptible cloud had fallen over his life. Upon the glassy waters was the
                     slight imperceptible tremor which hinted at coming shipwreck and storm.
                  In a moment the brain of Destrehan was in a whirl—the recent conversations and
                     incidents of his life was the gamut over which his memory was endlessly
                     running. For his week's happiness the fates were making bitter amends. However,
                     by an extraordinary effort he restrained any expression of feeling and
                     continued the conversation in the same tone of light jest as before.
                  There was one thing that now appeared obvious. Madeline, though she knew she
                     was plighted to another man, had deliberately set to work to make upon him the
                     deepest possible impression.
                  Another circumstance also noted was that Destrehan's gaiety produced upon her
                     the opposite effect. Her face became of a deadly 
                        palor
                        pallor
                     .
                  "I have not, after all, done more than amuse his fancy," she thought. "He
                     simply despises me for my treachery, and is only affected enough to be
                     astonished."
                  "I am not sorry to have met you, Madeline," he now said. "You have awakened a
                     great many dreamy fancies I shall delight to remember. Still I shall have
                     trouble to find some nepenthe for my regrets in having to leave you at
                     all."
                  At the moment he spoke but one idea was occupying the mind of Destrehan. He was
                     thinking of the many young men of brilliancy and talent whom he had seen wear
                     out and die from dissipation and other causes in his own short career. He was
                     wondering whether some such blow as he had just experienced had not been the
                     premonition of their doom, had not sounded the death-knell to happiness and
                     hope. A wild and unnatural species of ecstacy took possession of his
                     heart—melodies of pathos find tenderness were ringing in his ears. Madeline,
                     meanwhile, was gazing at him curiously.
                  "You are different from most men if you do not suffer. It is incredible that he
                     does not love me," she mentally reasoned.
                  "It is about the last time I shall have an opportunity of being happy," he
                     thought. "There is no need of talking of tragedies in the few moments that are
                     left."
                  The steamer upon which he was to return had previously signaled its approach,
                     and it now gave a more positive proof of its proximity by a train of smoke, and
                     of sparks which floated behind it like a plume. By degrees an immense black
                     mass became imprinted upon the horizon, assuming every moment clearer and
                     deeper outlines. It was one of those mountain loads of cotton, consisting of a
                     mass of about six thousand bales or more, which was bound for the Crescent
                     City, and which now confronted his vision.
                  A fire had been kindled upon the bank of the river, and in answer to this
                     signal the boat was rounding to.
                  Destrehan extended his hand. It was taken by Madeline, who released it slowly.
                     She was studying minutely every line of his face, and without avail.
               
               
                  VIII—The Great River.
                  The boat was run up close to the levee bank. It was attached by hawsers, and
                     the gangway shoved ashore. A bright light from a brazier, filled with
                     inflammable fagots, lighted the way on board.
                  As Destrehan was about to follow his baggage which had already preceded him, he
                     was not a little astonished to find that Caskie was in the boat and was just
                     coming ashore.
                  "What, Destrehan, my dear fellow, is it you?"
                  "You are right, it is me, Caskie. My time has come—business. I return to the
                     city by the boat you have quitted. I shall be just in time to take possession
                     of your berth."
                  "By no means, though you can have the one adjoining. I shall continue down the
                     river with you. We are to have a rather grand affair of it going down—there is
                     a very large number of young ladies and gentlemen on board on an excursion, not
                     to speak of four or five newly united couples, and a brass band."
                  "You do not then stop with our hospitable friends?"
                  "Only for a moment. In fact, I am in hopes that they are ready to keep me
                     company. For the moment, au revoir."
                  With the rapidity of movement which bespoke an object to be accomplished,
                     Caskie was already half way to the house, and was met upon the verandah by the
                     inmates.
                  Destrehan's impression on going on board the boat was a feeling of surprise
                     that C. should entertain any hopes of persuading Mme. Gilbaux and daughter to
                     accompany him to the city. Upon making inquiry, however, upon the boat, and
                     giving a glance at the shore, he saw in a moment that the boat would
                     necessarily be detained for a considerable interval. Upon the river bank
                     several hundred bales of cotton had been placed, and were now being shipped:
                     while the mates were none the less busy in taking on board cords of wood to be
                     used on the downward trip.
                  "It will take an hour, at least, to get away from here," Destrehan could not at
                     the time help ejaculating. "During that time, his readiness and power of
                     influencing will induce them to get ready, if the thing be possible."
                  In fact, Destrehan saw Madeline and her mother approaching the boat in
                     three-quarters of an hour after, preceded by negroes with flambeaux, and
                     bearing upon their shoulders the trunks and boxes which had been previously
                     prepared for the expedition.
                  "I am sorry for it," thought Destrehan. "If the choice had been left to me we
                     would never have met again by my seeking. Is it our good or our evil genius
                     that always tries us with just such coincidences."
                  Once the party, however, entered the boat, he exerted himself to show Mme.
                     Gilbaux and her daughter that deference and attention always due by the
                     stronger to the weaker sex, and he was now not sorry to see that Caskie was in
                     the mood for talking, and that an opportunity was afforded him (Destrehan) of
                     making himself really useful.
                  That is to say, that, while Caskie was narrating his adventures, an opportunity
                     was allowed Destrehan to look after and secure the baggage, making arrangements
                     for the berths, securing sleeping quarters for the servants brought along and
                     providing for the comfort of the ladies in numberless ways. These cares
                     occupied him sufficiently for some time after the boat had again started on her
                     course; and when excuses for these labors were exhausted, he continued to
                     acquit himself with some success in conversing about the scenery of the river
                     and the life, and movement which was meanwhile going on on the boat.
                  He was not sorry when a pretext was afforded him for retiring for the
                     night.
                  During the following day Destrehan's time was much consumed in renewing his
                     acquaintance with the Captain and some other friends he chanced to meet on
                     board. Mme. Gilbaux and her daughter were meanwhile surrounded with the society
                     of the ladies and gentlemen who were passengers, and who together contributed
                     to make a large party. Destrehan still showed himself watchful and attentive as
                     upon the preceding day. He, however, contrived to be near his fellow travelers
                     when others were in their company; and it also so happened that much more of
                     his attention was bestowed upon the mother than the daughter.
                  In spite, however, of his skill and finesse,
                     he had to admit to himself that his actions were suspected by Madeline.
                  "It will be out of the question to shirk altogether all animated conversation,"
                     he now reasoned, "without showing how profoundly affected I am and that I have
                     been indulging in dream. I must endeavor to appear a little interested and
                     susceptible—just a little."
                  In the afternoon, therefore, as the day approached its close, Destrehan threw
                     himself in her way. She was dressed in white, in full evening costume, in
                     anticipation of a hop to be given that evening, and Destrehan thought he had
                     never seen her look more radiant.
                  "Would it be happiness for you, Miss Madeline," he said, as they promenaded
                     upon the upper deck and looked at the scenery upon the river, "to dream away
                     your life in one of those old fashioned plantation chateaux which are
                     surrounded with dark, sombre foliage?"
                  "If one was a little in love the life might have some charms. But the gable
                     windows, slate roofs, and orange orchards would otherwise soon weary you to
                     death, even if the companion of whom you are disposed to dream did not do you
                     that kindness."
                  "But look for a moment at that house whose windows are illuminated by the
                     setting sun. It stands out in contrast with the shadows from the clouds, which
                     have fallen on everything else around, and gleams out bright as if conveying a
                     glimpse of dreamland. What truer type of life could you find, with this great
                     river to represent the muddy stream of existence. The surrounding scenery and
                     habitations will serve for our daily humdrum life, with its overhanging clouds.
                     It is in contrast with those that yonder house, whose windows are crimsoned by
                     the rays of the sun stands far off like the existence for which we sigh, and
                     which we never obtain.
                  "It looks as if one might be very happy there; let us persuade the Captain to
                     put us ashore and seek there shelter and happiness. Come, Caskie," said
                     Destrehan to the latter, who was now approaching, "and lend your entreaties to
                     mine. It is absolutely necessary that we should all become Arcadians."
                  "You will neither of you persuade me," said Madeline, "the banks look lonely.
                     The white walls which captivate your fancy are taking for me the form of
                     whitened sepulchres. The Spanish moss
                     gives the scenery a funereal gloom."
                  "I must confess that your Arcadian elysium, has no charms for me," said Caskie,
                     "though I do not quite feel safe upon this boat. The guards are loaded almost
                     to the water's edge."
               
               
                  IX—Premonition.
                  One of the momentary lulls ensued in the conversation, which frequently take
                     place in traveling and among those who remain long in each other's company. For
                     a half hour each of the party sat silent and absorbed, watching the sinking of
                     the sun, the silent gathering of clouds, and the darkness made visible by the
                     frequent flashes of lightning.
                  "Are you not afraid to remain here?" said Caskie, who was the first to speak,
                     and whose mind seemed running upon the perils of the river.
                  "No. I am in the mood to enjoy a thunderstorm for once."
                  "But why are we so silent? The ideas of all of us appear to be wandering away
                     in those clouds. Sentiment is not much in my line, but I am dull and depressed
                     enough this time. What are you studying about, Madeline?"
                  "I was for once studying about you—I was wondering," she said, half angrily,
                     "whether you ware capable of a sentiment—of an attachment for anything or
                     anybody."
                  "I am not strong that way. I get along better by calculation and rule."
                  "And the rule prompts you to look rather after your own than others'
                     interests," said Madeline, half laughingly, as if she now found the selfish
                     philosophy of the other speaker rather amusing than otherwise.
                  "Precisely. I wish no one any harm. If they succeed or not is not my affair. I
                     should help them or not as they might prove to be useful to me."
                  "I am afraid we should have a bad time of it. Mr. Destrehan, if we were in
                     danger. But tell me, Caskie, supposing I was alone upon these waters, and
                     compelled to rely upon you to reach the shore, do you think that you would save
                     me?"
                  Caskie's face assumed an uneasy expression at the idea suggested and a faint
                     shrug of the shoulders told his thought better than words.
                  "The ordeal in that case I conclude would be a little awkward," said he. "This
                     lake—for we have taken a short cut and got out of the river—a few years ago was
                     dry land, or at least swamp, covered with cypress trees. It has not been a
                     great while since a channel was cut through the cypress stumps when the water
                     was low, in order to admit of a passage for boats. It is in the middle of this
                     that we now are. The boat, as it is in the centre of the lake must be five
                     miles from land, and it would be impossible to run it from here to the
                     shore."
                  "Consequently you think we would all drown should the boat meet with an
                     accident."
                  "It would be certain death for three out of every four upon the boat—certain
                     death perhaps for every one who could not swim."
                  "But I am a woman—you, of course, would not consent to escape with your life to
                     long as I remained helpless."
                  Caskie's face grew dark and thoughtful. He hesitated a moment, but immediately
                     after answered with at compliment.
                  "No," said he, "in such company it would not be difficult to plunge headlong
                     into perdition."
                  Madeline laughed and repeated her question to Destrehan.
                  "My ideas are as philosophic," said he, "as those of Caskie. Only he is not
                     logical in the devotion which would actuate him in case any danger should
                     arise."
                  "And in the moment of danger you wish to tell me that you would be
                     logical?"
                  "I should witness with pleasure his devotion and sacrifice, if he attempted to
                     save you, and pray Heaven, meanwhile, for the successful termination of his
                     labors."
                  "And you really tell me that you would not assist me?"
                  "On the contrary, that you would not require my assistance—that it would be
                     unjust to deprive Caskie of the pleasure of being useful."
                  Madeline sighed, and turned toward Caskie.
                  "You see absolutely I must depend upon you."
                  "In that case," said he, "should an opportunity occur—"
                  "The opportunity will not be lacking," said Destrehan, "the last flash of
                     lightning has set the hay, piled upon the front of the boat, upon fire."
                  The observation that Destrehan had uttered quietly, not to say meditatively, as
                     if a piece of news that affected no one present, was indeed true. The boat was
                     on fire.
                  Madeline turned upon him and bestowed a look which showed that the mystery,
                     which had hitherto baffled her, was revealed.
                  "He loved me," she thought, "and having no hope, was too proud to betray his
                     secret. It is a matter of indifference to him whether the boat ever reaches
                     land or not."
                  Destrehan disappeared, and Caskie made two or three movements as if to go to
                     the assistance of the deck-hands, who were attempting to check the flames.
                  "Is there great danger," asked Madeline, who had been watching his face by the
                     light reflected from the burning vessel.
                  "We are lost," said he, as if speaking to himself. "Our only chance of ever
                     reaching land is in the small boats, that is if they have any."
                  The face of Madeline had become pale with terror. Destrehan was seen returning
                     from the lower cabins of the boat, and Caskie hurried to see the danger
                     himself.
                  "You will not abandon me," she said to Destrehan.
                  "Your best chance for safety will be in one of the boats," he replied
                     evasively. "But see there is but one of them, and they are lowering this."
                  "The weaker sex will have a preference."
                  "But there are so many ladies on board—four bridal parties alone. The boat
                     cannot be made to contain half of the number."
                  "If you would save your life, Madeline, there is not a moment to lose. Hasten
                     to the side of the boat and enter quickly. The passengers are already entering.
                     See, the men are abandoning the doomed vessel, as well as women and
                     children."
                  Madeline, for some reason, stood motionless, and looking piteously.
                  "And must I enter alone?"
                  "For a man who his strength it will be possible to keep afloat many hours to
                     come. But you are wasting time, Madeline, the boat is already too full. It you
                     would save your life, do not lose a moment."
                  Mme. Gilbaux was already in the boat, and was beckoning to her daughter to
                     hasten.
                  The boat was casting off her lines and the men who had entered were keeping
                     more passengers from entering.
                  At this sight the faculties of Madeline, which had been locked my and
                     paralyzed, recovered their action, and, half delirious with fear she rushed
                     toward the side of the boat.
                  Her impulse came too late. An attempt on her part to enter was prevented.
                  Paralyzed with terror she could only stretch her hand impotently toward the
                     boat and crave assistance by her glance.
                  At the same moment Caskie came rushing wildly from the direction of the cabin.
                     In one hand he held his papers and parchments, and in another a box which
                     appeared to contain treasure of the greatest value.
                  Madeline caught him by the sleeve.
                  He shook off her grasp like one whose mind was occupied with an idea—like one
                     who was scarcely aware by whom he was surrounded.
                  "It is me, Caskie," she cried; "do not abandon me."
                  Caskie did not seem to hear. He had thrown his boxes and papers into the boat,
                     and was about to spring after them.
                  Madeline threw herself upon him with her whole force. "Caskie," she cried, "as
                     you ever loved your mother or sister or any woman, do not abandon me. See, I am
                     here almost alone. It was you who made me come upon this boat. I did not want
                     to come."
                  Caskie, as Destrehan had already done, remonstrated hurriedly with the man on
                     the boat, and tried to assist Madeline to enter.
                  The answer that was received was a fierce shout to cast off the lines. The
                     reply of the rough deck-hands seemed to inspire Caskie with the same insanity
                     that had already possessed Madeline. He made a motion to spring over the sides
                     of the doomed steamer. Madeline, for the last time, threw herself into his
                     arms.
                  "For the love of Heaven do not leave me here to consume."
                  "Let me go," he fiercely muttered—"there is no use that we both perish. I tell
                     you not to cling to me—that I can be of no service." In a moment more he had
                     sprung over the rail into the water—in a moment more he had clutched hold of
                     the boat and effected an entrance in spite of the curses and execrations of the
                     rest of the crew.
                  It occupied several moments for the men to get to handling of the oars, and
                     meanwhile Caskie, now beyond, as he considered, the reach of danger, gazed,
                     with the air of a man who is damned, at the woman to whom he had been
                     betrothed—at the fiancee, whom he was leaving
                     behind.
                  "Wretch," said Madeline, and she threw upon him a glance of contempt. Caskie
                     shuddered, and covered his face with his hands.
                  "I could not help it, Madeline," he said. "I am no hero. Forgive me for not
                     dying at your side. I would give you my place now, if that were possible."
                  The boat had commenced moving away before she could answer. Madeline gazed
                     after it a moment in silence. The next, she gave a wild balance at the
                     ever-nearing flames.
                  "It is terrible," she said, "to have to die."
                  At this moment she caught sight of Destrehan. He had been standing at the
                     remote end of the boat. Apparently he had been a pensive spectator of
                     everything that had been transpiring around him.
                  "I believe we are the last that are left of the crew and passengers," said
                     Destrehan. "But see the boat upon which Caskie embarked. It is too heavily
                     laden, and the men are throwing him overboard."
                  "And the others," said Madeline, becoming a shade paler.
                  "They have preferred the chances of escaping death by floating upon the
                     shutters, chairs and furniture."
                  "But there is no need of jumping overboard until the flames reach this portion
                     of the steamer."
                  "Listen, there is a large amount of powder stowed in the hold of the boat. As
                     soon as the flames reach that portion an explosion will take place."
                  Madeline's face assumed one degree more of pallor, but she did not move.
                  "How many moments have we to live?"
                  "The explosion will probably take place within the next ten minutes."
                  "Ten minutes to live!" she cried, looking around wildly; "that is very
                     little."
                  "However," said Destrehan, "if you wish to save your life upon a shutter—"
                  "You have no pity for yourself—no mercy for me. No, not the dark water. I
                     prefer death here."
               
               
                  XI—Revelation.
                  Madeline had now abandoned all hope. Her eye began to brighten with a wild sort
                     of gaiety.
                  "Why do you wish to die?" she asked. Her face was beginning to look radiant
                     with an ecstacy of terror.
                  "I am luckier than most disappointed lovers. I cannot win you, but I can; the
                     next greatest happiness, have you to die with me—I can witness the tragedy of
                     your death. With my life—an eclipse—a charred and blurred ruin—what happiness
                     equal to that of reducing everything to the same chaos—of making a holocaust
                     and a funeral pyre of what is most precious? For I shall see you die, Madeline,
                     in your white bridal costume, like another Iphigenia, at the altar. I shall
                     have the cruel happiness of watching each shadow of the death agony upon your
                     face. You shall light for me the path to Stygian terrors, and we shall keep
                     each other company in the pale realm of shadows."
                  Madeline broke forth into a demoniacal laughter: "I never thought before that
                     an opportunity for coquetry would occur when death is but ten minutes distant.
                     But that is what it seems we are having now."
                  "She is going mad with terror," thought Destrehan.
                  "We have had a struggle, Destrehan, to see which would make the other
                     submit—which had the strongest will. It is you who have succeeded. You make me
                     confess, though you are, merciless, for the poor privilege of dying in your
                     arms, that I love you."
                  Destrehan clasped her in his arms, and gave a sigh of despair.
                  A new idea penetrated his soul. "It is very hard," he reasoned, "to die with
                     such happiness behind." "But the fire has reached the hold, where the powder is
                     stored—we have but a moment to live."
                  "Let us remain, then, thus. I should have liked it better if you had showed me
                     before that you loved me a little. But I shall put my fingers now through your
                     hair—I shall give you a little pat on the cheek—I—"
                  Destrehan tore himself away.
                  He dipped his handkerchief in water, wrapped it about his nostrils, and quickly
                     descended into the lower cabin. The place was filled with smoke. But the
                     central lantern still hung from the ceiling, and save a few doors that had been
                     torn away, or a few articles of clothing that had been scattered about, it was
                     difficult to tell that the place was deserted by its former occupants, and was
                     threatened with impending ruin.
                  But he did not stop here. Destrehan rapidly pushed on to the portion of the
                     boat where the powder was stored.
                  His arrival at the scene of danger was not a moment too soon. There were, it is
                     true, but a small quantity of powder stored there, but in a few moments more it
                     would have been reached by the flames. His first care was to push these kegs
                     beyond the immediate reach of danger. His next to burst open a window and take
                     into his parched lungs a fresh breath of air. His last act was to carry the
                     kegs to the deck above and throw them into the water.
                  As he emerged upon the deck for the last time, a light was discovered upon the river behind.
                     Destrehan rubbed his eyes for a moment and thought that he had been
                     dreaming.
                  "Do your see that light, Madeline?"
                  "Yes;" said Madeline, "is it another steamboat conflagration?"
                  "No; that is the head-light of the boat with which we have been racing. In less
                     than half an hour the boat will be here. Madeline, in less than that time we
                     will be beyond the reach of danger."
                  Destrehan's prediction was justified by the result. The boat which came after
                     rescued its two sole remaining occupants, and many of those who had sought
                     safety in the water.
                  But among the corpses which floated ghastly and pallid around the waters, now
                     illuminated by the burning boats, was that of Caskie; and in addition to the
                     other bridal parties that did reach the city was that made by Destrehan and
                     Madeline.
                  Destrehan hastened upon his arrival to his compliments to his uncle; but death
                     had already removed from him the power of perpetrating any further practical
                     jokes. It did not prevent him, however from bequeathing a fortune to his
                     nephew, coupled with the cynical, and what seemed at first impossible proviso,
                     to marry a woman who, when the will was made, was the fiancee of another. However, the happiness of no party was marred
                     by the stipulation, as the lady referred to in the will proved to be none other
                     than Madeline, Destrehan's actual bride.
               
            
            
               THE HOMEWARD JOURNEY.
               A Romance of the Last Days of the War.
               
                  I—Travel.
                  During the month which was destined to prove the last of the Confederate war, a
                     couple of old soldiers, at Petersburg,, obtained an invalid furlough to go
                     South. They will figure in this narrative by the names of Wheelhanney and
                     Corsely.
                  Corsely had been the cook of his mess, and was a man of genius. He however knew
                     but little of the art of conversation or of society, and could not understand a
                     joke.
                  Wheelhanney was of an overgrown build, with a figure too corpulent for a
                     soldier, but with a certain springness of step and restlessness of disposition
                     which counteracted the effects of his extraordinary growth.
                  Upon the night that the furloughs were brought into camp, three days' rations
                     had been issued, and in honor of the event most of these were consumed at
                     supper. What they did not eat that night Corsely the next morning fried.
                  While the letter was absorbed and made gloomy by this last occupation,
                     Wheelhanney had climbed the breastworks, and was waving his handkerchief at the
                     opposite picket lines. The day was beginning to dawn, but both sides were still
                     keeping up their nightly picket fire.
                  "Come down from there," cried Corsely, "what are you doing up there?"
                  "We are to be absent for at least a month," said Wheelhanney. "It would,
                     therefore, be lacking in politeness at leaving not to wave our friends some
                     sort of an adieu."
                  "Don't do that," cried Corsely, the bravest, but most superstitious man in
                     camp. "You have been under fire every day for six months, and have not yet lost
                     your life. But it did not belong to you then, and it did not much matter
                     whether you lost it or not. But you are free now for a little while—I would not
                     expose mine to a second chance shot or bullet, no matter what you might give
                     me."
                  Still Wheelhanney, with his tremendous figure, waved his salute with the utmost
                     formality, and having placed his breakfast in his haversack, to eat on the way,
                     stalked out, with Corsely following behind, and with no regrets at leaving
                     camp.
                  Having reached the depot for the train to Richmond—the only way at that day of
                     traveling to the Gulf States—Corsely remembered that no transportation or pass
                     over the road had been furnished, and that furloughed soldiers, from some
                     military exigency, were expected to walk the twenty miles intervening between
                     the Capital and camp.
                  "The absence of the ticket does not greatly matter," said Wheelhanney, whose
                     tremendous figure made him averse to over fatigue. "We will travel without
                     it."
                  Approaching then a car window, at which sat a soldier, who was already inside,
                     and who had been detailed to go to Richmond, Wheelhanney begged the momentary
                     loan of his passport. The request, after some hesitation, was granted. With
                     this Wheelhanney passed the Sentinel, and the moment after handed through the
                     window the paper to 
                        Corsley
                        Corsely
                     . The latter having entered, the document was restored to its owner,
                     and the two adventurers now began to look around and observe the inmates of the
                     car.
                  Shortly after a lady, young looking and unattended, entered. The seats were
                     nearly all taken, and she was compelled to occupy one upon the opposite side to
                     our two travelers. This seat, in common with the one viz-a-vizing it, had been
                     already partially covered with shawls and bundles. The owners of these latter
                     articles were two ladies who were (doubtless compelled by the exigencies of
                     war) traveling alone.
                  "I should say that the eldest of those two already seated is the mother and the
                     other the daughter," said Wheelhanney, who was now closely studying the
                     situation; "but who do you take the new comer to be?"
                  "She looks piquant and intelligent, and not at all at a loss, in spite of her
                     youth, in taking care of herself."
                  "The one you call the mother appears to be an invalid," said Wheelhanney.
                     "Judging from her sickly appearance, it will not be a great while before she
                     travels the long journey. She will never again see Petersburg."
                  The train started, and when the conductor came round to examine tickets,
                     Wheelhanney remarked that all three of the travelers were bound South.
                  "We must get acquainted with them at once," said Wheelhanney.
                  Corsely shrugged his shoulders. Still his eye lingered as he glanced to the
                     opposite side at the young girl spoken of as the daughter.
               
               
                  II.-An Acquaintance.
                  At this moment, as if divining their thoughts, the last comer turned towards
                     Wheelhanney, and, with the license then common enough among travelers of both
                     sexes, addressed him a remark.
                  "Are you familiar at all with Richmond?" she said.
                  "I have had occasion to go there a good many times," said Wheelhanney. "I may
                     say that I am well acquainted."
                  The remark was true. He had been placed under arrest twenty times for leaving
                     camp without permission, to visit the capital.
                  "I wish to secure a place at which to remain," she said, "until the next train
                     leaves the city. I need hardly fell
                     you that the city is so occupied that the work will be one of difficulty."
                  The face of the speaker had about it an air of piquancy—an air of shrewdness
                     and of experience, and one which admitted that any remark made would be
                     construed in the most amiable light.
                  "Madame, if that is the right title—"
                  "You may call me madame."
                  "I was proceeding to tell you that I had an excellent boardinghouse the last
                     time I remained in the city. But this, upon second thoughts I remember, was
                     lost in consequence of the aspersions of interested slanderers."
                  "And what were these?" inquired the lady with vivacity.
                  "I speak of them with regret," replied Wheelhanney, with an air of diffidence.
                     "I was accused, in the first place, of eating more than any two men at the
                     table. Such a charge at such a time was"—
                  "A very grave accusation," said the lady. "And the others?"
                  "I was popular with some of the ladies at the same house, and among others,
                     with our landlord's daughters. Again the victim of malice, I was now accused of
                     having married a new wife at every place at which our regiment had been
                     stationed. Furthermore, I was accused of attempting to inveigle one of the
                     daughters in the same sort of wedlock."
                  "You were badly treated. But the consequence?"
                  "The consequence was that the feelings of the father were aroused against
                     me."
                  "Did he do anything desperate?"
                  "Decidedly. The very next week he doubled upon me the price of board. But you,
                     Madame; your face looks familiar—have we not met before?"
                  "Possibly. If you are from the Crescent City you must have seen me upon the
                     boards of the Varieties, and St. Charles before the war. I used to act
                     soubrette parts."
                  "But you seem familiar with the army?"
                  "During the excitement of the first year I enlisted into a regiment as
                     vivandiere. However, I soon discovered my mistake—I did not remain long."
                  "Doubtless, the dull routine of camp life must have depressed the mercury of
                     your spirits."
                  "Yes, I am too volatile. But I was left behind in the enemy's country,
                     accidentally."
                  "An interesting situation, undoubtedly," said Wheelhanney.
                  "Still the fact did not prevent me from making friends. You should have seen
                     the 
                        miliner's
                        milliner's
                      bill that were paid for me, although I gave no suitor any good reason
                     for flattering his vanity. Unfortunately my riches did me no good. There was a
                     sudden advance of the Confederate army. I obtained some intelligence which it
                     was of the last importance our generals should know. I now borrowed a horse
                     from one of my admirers, and, during his absence, placed myself under still
                     further obligations by dressing in his uniform, and leaving behind my skirts as
                     a token. I succeeded in communicating the news. Still I could not help
                     regretting the costume I had left behind. I obtained the rank of a lieutenant,
                     and permission to appear in male attire; and having nothing else to wear, this
                     I was compelled to do."
                  "You appear to be as useful to your friends as you are dangerous to your
                     enemies. Your experience is worth listening to."
                  "Do you know that after that I was complimented by obtaining a commission as
                     surgeon in the army? A friend with a large house gave me charge of it, and I
                     turned it into an hospital. Hence my commission."
                  "And what was your success in the profession of Æsculanius?"
                  "It requires but little skill to potter away with drugs, and a good deal of
                     careful nursing. A calumniator accused me of prescribing remedies that were not
                     countenanced by the text-books, and of sending my patients much oftener to the
                     grave-yard than back to camp. I lost my situation, but it did not prevent me
                     from taking personal satisfaction out of the slanderer."
                  "Doubtless you felt like settling down by this time."
                  "Yes, I wished to do so. But soon after, I felt compelled to empty my revolver
                     at some one else who had gone still further and assailed my honor. I tried next
                     getting married, but I had my faults," said the ex-vivandiere pensively, "and I fear I am not suited for domestic
                     life. In fact, my husband's conduct became so disgusting and unendurable, that
                     I was surprised into the indiscretion of cowhiding him a week after he had led
                     me to the altar. Poor fellow—he died shortly after. It is upon his account you
                     see me dressed in the robe of mitigated grief."
                  "And what is to be the next of your adventures?"
                  "I am ordered to report at Mobile. You see I carry my orders in my belt. But
                     what sort of a house is this at which you propose to stop?"
                  "It is but a little distance from the depot," said Wheelhanney, as he led the
                     way from the cars. "The porter is here and will look after our baggage. The
                     distance is so short that we can easily walk there."
                  "That will be an advantage, as it is now very near the hour for supper, and the
                     train south leaves at nine. But the house itself"—
                  "The house itself is conducted on a war footing. It is crowded with every class
                     of boarders—soldiers, bureau clerks, milliners, artists, adventurers of one sex
                     and another. The house is shared in a friendly cat-and-dog style, and every one
                     does what is right in their own eyes."
               
               
                  III—A Half.
                  Wheelhanney accompanied by his new acquaintance and Corsely had by this time
                     arrived at the 
                        boarding-horse
                        boarding-house
                      in question. The vivandiere was introduced to the landlady, and the
                     fact of the arrival was otherwise proclaimed by an impatient guest, who threw
                     open a window in the direction of the kitchen and shouted "Supper!"
                  A supper followed, at which a large number of guests of both sexes sat down and
                     to most of these Wheelhanney's new acquaintance seemed well known. A lively
                     conversation about army matters ensued with three or four of the gentlemen,
                     whose characters cropped out with their whiskers or were betrayed in their
                     diamond pins, and an animated dialogue was kept up with some of the fairer
                     portion of the guests, who, it appeared, were artistes, as to the gossip of the
                     stage. During the course of this, the Vivandiere told of her last appearance on
                     the stage—how she had had a quarrel with a rival, who was disposed to give
                     herself superior airs—how the latter had insisted upon appropriating the whole
                     of a mirror to dress by, although there was an urgent necessity for others to
                     go on the stage, and how the dispute between the Vivandiere and her rival had
                     ended in a struggle for the looking-glass, and in the mirror itself being
                     broken over the head of the ungenerous rival.
                  "I can't say that I take much interest in the stories of your new friend," said
                     Corsely; "and, look, do you remember the lady and her daughter who traveled
                     with us to-day? Yonder they are, at the foot of the table."
                  "This must seem a strange scene to that young girl, who looks as if she had
                     been carefully raised. It must be a shock to her pure soul to have to be thrown
                     in contact with such a mixed crowd, and to have to listen to such tiresome
                     stories."
                  "For my part, I am perfectly willing that the ex-vivandiere shall continue
                     talking, aa it gives us an opportunity to keep eating all the longer."
                  As if a suspicion that such was Wheelhanney's purpose had entered the mind of
                     the host, he here proposed drinks—perhaps finding it cheaper to afford the
                     liquors than the provisions.
                  "It is very near time that we were at the depot," said Corsely; "and our
                     passports, transportation and baggage must be looked after."
                  "Mr. Wheelhanney is to look after me," said the widowed vivandiere, and
                     Corsely, judging from her manner that all further remonstrance would be
                     useless, started off alone to make his preparations without further loss of
                     time.
                  A half hour later the three travelers all entered the train for the South. The
                     last that was seen of the Confederate Capital, a soldier starting off for camp
                     was amusing himself by throwing stones at the fourth story windows of a
                     hotel.
                  Corsely hardly knew why, but this trivial incident affected him
                     superstitiously, as an omen of coming disaster.
                  The travelers entered the train. Wheelhanney having upon his arm the
                     acquaintance of the day before, was allowed to enter the traveling car set
                     apart for ladies, after some persuasion and entreaties from the latter. It
                     fared, however, worse with Corsely, who was condemned to a car dimly lighted,
                     badly ventilated, and where he was surrounded by what appeared to him the
                     rudest and roughest men in the army.
                  While he was sitting in the dark, reflecting over his unenviable traveling
                     accommodations, a respectable looking citizen approached the door with a
                     lantern, and inquired if any one was going as far as Georgia. A rough voice
                     answered "Yes," and demanded the reason for the inquiry.
                  "Because," said the citizen, "there is a lady here who is going South."
                  "And you want somebody to pilot her through?" inquired the voice. "Is she
                     good-looking, or ugly?"
                  "She is a very respectable middle-aged lady," answered the citizen, in a tone
                     of rebuke.
                  "Well, there's no need talking, stranger, if she's not good-looking. Old women
                     are not worth wintering or transportation in these times, and have got no
                     business paddling about from one end of the country to the other."
                  Corsely here, moved with pity, interposed, and his offer of assistance was
                     thankfully accepted.
                  He followed his guide into the ladies' car, and was by him introduced to those
                     for whom he was to act as an escort. He was now not a little astonished to find
                     that they were the mother and daughter with whom he had traveled upon the
                     preceding day from Petersburg. Upon a seat adjoining theirs, was 
                        Wheelhanny
                        Wheelhanney
                     , and there, too, at his side, was the vivandiere.
                  Corsely repeated his offer of service already made to his guide. The elder lady
                     who had looked like an invalid when he had first seen her, looked like one now
                     more so than ever. It however, did not prevent him from experiencing a feeling
                     of pity, and form the generous determination to be of what service he
                     could.
                  Being an invalid, she stated, and with but a short time before her to live, she
                     had become alarmed at the threatened dangers which environed Richmond. Her
                     object in leaving the capital was to place her daughter in a place of
                     safety.
                  Corsely now glanced at the latter and could not help remarking that young girl
                     was of naive appearance and had a captivating air of innocence and candor. He
                     had, however, but little talent for conversation and consequently contented
                     himself with making himself useful in a dozen ways which his good nature
                     suggested, and in listening to the conversation of the others of the party.
                  Nothing further occurred during the first fifty miles of their route. But this
                     distance gone over the train came to a river—a bridge was found to be down. The
                     passengers had to cross in ferryboats, the baggage to be unloaded and
                     superintended, and it was with the utmost difficulty that he succeeded in
                     getting the trunks and their owners on board before the departure of the train.
                     As it was, the cars suddenly started without warning, and Corsely was almost
                     left behind with the daughter.
                  At Charlottesville, the good natured Corsely had to remain up half the night in
                     trying to keep together the baggage of his helpless charge; and in subsequently
                     finding out to what hotel their owners had gone. To crown his good acts he had
                     spent a considerable portion of his slender funds in having the baggage removed
                     by porters, and was afterwards too modest to make any allusion to the fact. He
                     succeeded with somewhat the same trouble in getting his party upon the train at
                     the proper time the next day.
                  With Wheelhanney, meanwhile, it had been different. The ex-
                        vivandeire
                        vivandiere
                      was in excellent condition, and had an endless theme to talk of in
                     her own adventures. 
                        Wheelhanny
                        Wheelhanney
                     , too, had about him an unfailing fund of animal spirits, and a voice
                     and lungs which could be heard above the puffing of the engine—a valuable
                     quality with a talker on the cars. He had, too, a remarkable faculty of making
                     an impression on crowds quickly: the through passengers wanted to sit near him
                     during the day, and when the train stopped, they generally followed his lead to
                     the hotel.
                  Thus far the travelers had escaped any delays from the unsettled condition of
                     the country, and from the dilapidated state of the cars and tracks. The danger
                     from either source had however been postponed—not avoided.
               
               
                  IV—A Night to be Remembered.
                  It was about midnight on the third night after leaving Richmond that an
                     accident to the cars occurred. The sky was illumined at the time with a lurid
                     light, which suggested conflagrations and the dangers into which every mile of
                     their journey was hurrying them. The night was bitter cold, and when the first
                     sudden jarring sensation was felt, which threw every one off their feet, the
                     general impression was that an attack had been made by the enemy.
                  The danger was soon discovered to have affected only the machinery of the
                     engine, but this was of so serious a character as to show at once that there
                     would be a delay.
                  The passengers were compelled to alight, and each to exert himself against the
                     effects of the bitter cold. They found themselves, too, forced to remain in a
                     village fast hurrying to ruin, and the old house which served as a hotel was of
                     the most desolate and dilapidated character. A small drawing room, into which
                     at least fifty people were crowded, was the only resource in-doors against the
                     extreme severity of the weather. Furniture, the house could boast almost none.
                     There were but few chairs, and the guests were mostly compelled to sit upon
                     sticks of wood, boxes, and even upon the floor itself. A large fire was a
                     necessity, from the extreme severity
                     of the weather. At the same time, many of the travelers were compelled to
                     suffer from the smallness of the room, either the tortures of the flame or the
                     severest draughts of the wind, from being placed too near to the door or too
                     close to the fire. Misery from one source or the other, there was no escape
                     from.
                  It was into this room that the mixed and variously assorted crowd of travelers
                     now found themselves thrust, and compelled to dispose of their time as they
                     best might. A red flare at the window showed most of the passengers were out of
                     doors, and were assembled around a huge fire, taken from the piles of wood used
                     as fuel for the engines. Under the depot shed might be seen one soldier
                     guarding his baggage with his drawn sword; a another place was a crowd
                     organized into a Lynch mob, and administering justice to thieves detected in
                     stealing, with the lash; while over every face was spread that wearied
                     expression which indicated that life was a struggle.
                  Wheelhanney had naturally a cheerful temperament, and having a valise with him
                     when the travelers entered the depot, was good-natured enough to place it at
                     the service of the ex-vivandiere. She, however, generously declined accepting
                     of more than half of it, and absolutely insisted upon her stout cavalier
                     placing himself at her side. Under the circumstances, the favor accorded was
                     hardly a privilege. Poor Wheelhanney had now succumbed to the general weariness
                     and exhaustion, and was obliged to plead headache in answer to the inquiries of
                     his more talkative companion. His plea, however, did him no effectual good. A
                     bottle of cologne was produced from a basket, and Wheelhanney had to submit to
                     having his hair shampooed before an admiring audience. His gratitude prompted
                     him to show some animation. But this sacrifice he was spared. The
                     ex-vivandiere, upon resuming her seat, was soon affected by the general
                     dullness and Wheelhanney was rash enough to suppose it the correct thing to do
                     to place his arm around her waist to keep her from falling. Unfortunately the
                     fair sleeper awoke at length with a start and was so far from feeling grateful
                     for the use she had made of Wheelhanney's shoulder and arm as to administer to
                     him several severe buffets about the face and ear. Wheelhanney, in fact, upon
                     thoroughly awakening to a sense of the situation, felt disposed to congratulate
                     himself upon having fared no worse, and upon having escaped the punishment
                     which had befallen the last husband.
                  If the scene in this case thus momentarily had about it a touch of humor, it
                     was the exception and not the rule. With the unfortunate matron whom Corsely
                     had undertaken to protect, the situation had already began to assume a tragic
                     character. The intense severity of the weather and the fatigues of traveling
                     had exceeded her strength. It was with difficulty that Corsely, assisted by her
                     daughter, could remove the invalid from the cars, and the lack of
                     accommodations in the crowded room had soon exhausted her remaining strength.
                     Her situation now became so alarming that Corsely with great trouble succeeded
                     in obtaining for the invalid a bed. His philanthropy prompted him to endeavor
                     to obtain a doctor, and to dispatch the ex-Vivandiere to the assistance of the
                     daughter. But the dying mother could not be made to endure the animated and
                     somewhat noisy movements of Wheelhanney's friend, and begged to be allowed to
                     die without the latter's presence.
                  "That daughter, whose name appears to be Danie, is an interesting girl,"
                     thought Corsely: "but the sands of life for the invalid are evidently running
                     out. When the train starts it will be a pity to have to leave her to die here
                     alone."
                  In this situation, he was not surprised toward daylight at being begged to
                     appear at the poor woman's bedside. He rightly guessed that it was to listen to
                     some dying request.
                  As he entered the rude chamber, faintly illuminated by tallow candies, and
                     which gusts of wind through the broken penes of glass were momentarily
                     threatening to extinguish, Corsely could not help entertaining a sentiment of
                     sincere compassion. It was some moments after he entered before she could speak
                     sufficiently loud for him to hear; and the imminence of death lent her words
                     additional force and solemnity.
                  "Kind friend," she said slowly and falteringly, "I am approaching the end of my
                     journey."
                  Corsely endeavored to murmur some words of consolation and hope.
                  "For myself," she resumed, "I have no regrets. I had at most but a few weeks to
                     live. My poor daughter, Danie! I had hoped to secure for her a safe home before
                     my death."
                  Corsely was sufficiently affected to endeavor the second time to infuse some
                     hope into the mind of the dying mother; he, however, saw himself that death
                     could not be deferred.
                  "What I wish now to tell you," she continued, when she had gained sufficient
                     strength, "is that you have acted very generously toward me. I wish too that
                     you would continue to extend your pity to Danie after my death. I wish that she
                     should proceed with you to-morrow and be placed at the end of her journey under
                     the care of her friends. I have confidence in her. I do not believe that you
                     would wrong her if you could. Assist me then, in persuading her to leave with
                     you to-morrow morning."
                  "And leave you here, to die alone! That would be shocking."
                  "I shall die more happily at knowing that she is on her way to her
                     friends."
                  Observing that opposition only wasted her strength, and not knowing what
                     further answer to make, Corsely summoned the daughter.
                  "I shall not be sufficiently well to-morrow, Danie," the mother said to her,
                     "to proceed upon my journey. But it will be absolutely necessary that one of us
                     should go. I have, therefore, arranged that you travel without me. This
                     gentleman will continue to assist you until you are under the care of your
                     friends."
                  "But, mother, I cannot think of leaving you, when your health is so feeble. You
                     cannot mean it."
                  "It is for your good, as well as mine, that I beg this. I am too weak to say
                     more."
                  "Ask me anything but that," said the poor girl, voice drowned in sobs. "I
                     should never cease having regrets, were I to leave you to die among
                     strangers."
                  It soon became obvious to the mother that all further words would be useless;
                     or, perhaps, from exhaustion, the invalid ceased her efforts. From that moment,
                     however, her strength commenced rapidly to fail. Corsely thought 
                        the the
                        the
                      mother now wished to die as soon as possible, deeming a further
                     prolongation of her life as more than useless.
                  The daughter and Corsely remained by the bedside as the only watchers. By the
                     first streak of daylight the vital spark had fled.
                  He had at first reluctantly made up his mind to leave the poor girl behind,
                     upon the departure of the train; but his generosity prevailed, and, as he soon
                     discovered, cost him nothing—that is to say, the accident was not repaired the
                     next day in time to enable the train to continue up.
                  During the delay the body had been committed to the dust, and an army chaplain,
                     who was on the train, had given it the last rites of burial.
               
               
                  V.—A New Role.
                  Corsely had lived but little in female society, and found his present situation
                     not a little embarrassing. The cars having, however, started, he exerted
                     himself timidly to console the young girl for the loss of her mother, and used
                     to the best of his power the expressions of sympathy which mitigate, if they do
                     not banish grief.
                  The careless conversation of Wheelhanney and the ex-vivandiere, and the absurd
                     situations both parties were constantly placing themselves in, contributed not
                     a little to distract the attention of the young girl from her great
                     bereavement. At the station, for instance, at which the accident had occurred
                     to the cars, a trunk broken open and a large number of photographs,
                     loveletters, rings, handkerchiefs and other interesting souvenirs of his
                     prowess among the fair had, as he asserted, been stolen from him. It is true
                     the thief had been caught and summarily dealt with by an angry crowd of
                     soldiers, but not sufficiently so as to cause him to betray what had become of
                     the valuable relics.
                  Subsequently, when the cars were in motion, Wheelhanney had had his hands fall
                     with a matron, who kept him busy at one time opening and shutting windows, or
                     compelling him to change seats with her when the sun was inconvenient or the
                     stove too hot or cold. Once, with a view to warming the mother's heart through
                     her child, he had taken her baby and dandled it in his arms until the little
                     cherub had kicked off his linen by way of showing his delight. Unfortunately,
                     Wheelhanney had ventured a step beyond. There was a circular 
                        apperture
                        aperture
                      in the roofing of the car, and Wheelhanney, bent on still further
                     pleasing, put the child's head into the opening. The child laughed more than
                     ever, but so did not the mother. The experiment had resulted different from
                     what had been expected. If he had put it into the jaws of a lion, she would
                     not, apparently, have been any more pleased. For it now appeared that the
                     circular aperture had been once used to allow of the passage of smoke, and in
                     consequence of that fact charcoal would scarcely have made a white mark upon
                     the infant. How Wheelhanney kept from fainting at the look which the mother
                     gave him has never been known.
                  By the time that Corsely and his charge had traveled another day together, a
                     sentiment of a friendly nature had sprung up in Danie's heart, and to some
                     extent occupied the mother's place. During the previous night that had been
                     spent at the station, Danie had observed, with dislike, the conduct of the
                        ex-vivandiere in going to sleep upon
                     Wheelhanney's shoulder, and she had evidently regarded the whole affair as an
                     indiscretion of which no lady would be guilty. But now, worn down with
                     traveling and watching, and overcome with that sleep which, when long deferred
                     is irresistible, she had found upon waking up that she had been guilty of the
                     same fault. She had been sleeping upon Corsely's shoulder, and his arm too had
                     supported her figure.
                  As Corsely therefore, about daylight, sleepily opened his eyes they rested upon
                     her face, which was now blushing scarlet, and which was turned toward him with
                     an expression he did not at first understand.
                  "What is the matter, Miss Danie?" he inquired.
                  "Do you remember that my poor mother placed me under your care?"
                  "I remember it," said Corsely, proudly, unsuspectingly drawing his companion
                     still closer to him.
                  Miss Danie's face became still redder, but she only gazed at him fixedly, and
                     did not move,
                  "Suppose," said she, "you were, Mr. Corsely, on your death bed, and had a near
                     lady relative to dispose of. Suppose further you were to intrust her to one
                     whom you imagined a friend—or who at least promised to act toward her in that
                     capacity. What now ought to be thought of him if a day after you were in your
                     grave, he treated his charge in such a way as to lessen her own respect, and to
                     forfeit that of all who might see her?"
                  "I should think the gentleman would show himself a great rascal," said Corsely,
                     with simplicity, not yet understanding clearly her meaning, or removing his
                     arm.
                  His companion still did not shift her position, but sat gazing at him with
                     humid eyes.
                  "Don't you think you should move your arm," said she at last, becoming a little
                     impatient at his dullness.
                  "I don't think I ought. Let us discuss the matter a little, and then I shall
                     perhaps do as you say. If I understand, you now no longer have any home, and
                     are going among new friends."
                  "Yes, they will be strangers to me. This consideration ought to induce you at
                     once to make my position less embarrassing."
                  "I am coming to that. Let my arm, at any rate, remain until you accept or
                     reject my love. You will have in me a certain friend. Can you say as much for
                     those among whom you are going? It is no time for ceremony now. Accept me, and
                     we will be married to-night."
                  "You take away my breath. (She was in reality looking very pale.) But your
                     offer is generous, and only adds to my other obligations."
                  "And you accept it?"
                  "No, not that; but I should like to show you that, I am affected by your
                     generosity."
                  "Considering how we are both situated, we can at least for once speak
                     frankly—discuss the matter upon business principles."
                  "I shall tell you the truth, if that is what you wish. But, if we are to talk
                     upon the basis of matter of fact, and not romance, you should remove your
                     arm."
                  So far, Corsely had progressed smoothly enough. But he became so absorbed for a
                     moment in thinking what would be the next best leading question to ask, that he
                     forgot the last suggestion.
                  "Don't you think you might like me?" he at last propounded as an inquiry that
                     might lead to satisfactory results; but Danie answered so quickly, "Oh yes, I
                     am quite sure I like you," that he doubted whether his interrogatory had been
                     the right one.
                  "It's not your gratitude and good nature, mind you. I wish you now to
                     show."
                  "I would have liked you without your good sets—that is, I think you would have
                     amused and interested me. I should, however, have resisted any impression you
                     might have made. My best compliment to you is that I tell you my impressions
                     candidly, honestly, what we do not often do among our sex, what we never do
                     except to those for whose dispositions we have decided fancy."
                  "Ah, that is at any rate a compliment. I have enough vanity to have felt
                     wronged if you had thought otherwise. With so many jostling events at ever
                     moment, crowding upon us that certainly is enough to ground a still warmer
                     attachments. But let us talk of the difficulties. In the first place—"
                  "In the first place we know so little of each other. We might be both deceived
                     in the other."
                  "I may be a swindler, for aught you know; but you have not mentioned what is a
                     more serious obstacle, perhaps, than a risk which, after all, is only problematical. I am a
                     soldier. I do not now see how I should assist or maintain you—which is almost
                     as bad as being a swindler. But in the happiness of winning you, this
                     consideration would not trouble me. My heart would be too light to be cast
                     down, if your face did not repine. Still, it is not a brilliant offer, the hand
                     of a wounded soldier, just from the trenches, with no worldly goods but what
                     are contained in his knapsack."
                  "And you offer me all this tempting wealth?"
                  "And with it my heart, Miss Danie."
                  "Your readiness to meet the ills of life charms me more than any fortune. I
                     have no intimate friends or near relatives I expect to see. I am embarrassingly
                     at a loss to know what will become of me. Still, it is a serious question, that
                     of getting married. I do not know anything of you, except that you are too
                     poor—"
                  Danie appeared to hesitate.
                  "You had perhaps better finish," said Corsely.
                  "There is but one word more to say," said Danie. "I do not love you."
                  "Your decision is, perhaps, the most sensible one, Miss Danie. I am sorry you
                     did not elect me to travel with you through life; still for the day, or rather
                     night, that we will be in each other's company"—
                  "Are we then so soon to separate."
                  "Yes," said Corsely. "We have passed half through Georgia—from Augusta to
                     Mayfield. In a few minutes we will be at the last named station, and then the
                     railroad ends. Sherman has just marched through this State, and the only way of
                     getting over the next thirty-six miles is either by riding in a carriage, or
                     walking upon foot."
                  "In that case we must ride," said Danie.
                  "It will cost a great deal of money. The enemy have swept the country of
                     horses; and a friend, who has already traversed the South, says that it will
                     cost at least five hundred dollars a piece in paper money."
                  Danie remained silent, and, as the train had now reached the station, Corsely
                     went forward to secure some conveyance.
                  "It will take all of the money I have to get this poor girl to her friends," he
                     reasoned; "and after to-morrow I shall never see her again. Still she must not
                     be left here."
               
               
                  VI.—A Forced March.
                  Corsely, upon inquiry, found that the only conveyance to be obtained was an old
                     cart, capable of holding twelve or fifteen persons. To this was attached three
                     yoke of oxen. There was scarcely room for the ladies who were traveling and
                     none whatever for gentlemen. By a display of the small amount of gold which he
                     carried upon his person, Corsely succeeded in obtaining a seat for Danie.
                  The ex-vivandiere, who appeared not to be lacking in resources, was equally
                     fortunate.
                  By the time these arrangements were made it had become dark, and a silent
                     drizzling rain added to the obscurity overhead. Still the country was in too
                     unsettled a condition and the propinquity of Sherman's army too near for any
                     one to dream of pause or rest upon this account.
                  A halt took place at an old plantation house for a half an hour, where a large
                     fire was kindled in the parlor. On sitting down, a supper-table regaled the
                     travelers with such delicacies as spareribs and backbones. The oxcart was then
                     brought to the front door and entered by the ladies of the party, and the
                     soldiers lit their pipes and braced themselves for the long march through the
                     heavy, clinging mud. A colored Phaeton appeared with a flambeau of resinous
                     lightwood held in one hand, and a whip with an immense lash held in the other,
                     and throwing himself upon the back of one of his oxen, was soon urging his
                     cattle forward through the thick shades. His chariot he guided by his cries and
                     by the lash.
                  No lines of any cart were used by him, and pushing on his way, verging from one
                     side of the road to the other, the vehicle seemed in constant danger of
                     upsetting, or of going over some steep bank. The party finally came to a deep
                     stream, which all had intended to cross by getting in the cart; but partly from
                     the impatience of the oxen, partly through the interference of the
                     ex-vivandiere, partly from the carelessness of the driver, the latter had
                     reached the opposite bank before mention was made of the river to Wheelhanney
                     and others behind. It was, therefore, not without some laughter from the part
                     upon one side—and, of curses, upon the other—that the situation was realized.
                     Wheelhanney arrived at the water's edge, mounted a stump, and instead of
                     marching through, stood, with torch in hand, looking wistfully across, and
                     cursing the driver as a d——d old leather-headed fool for not giving him
                     warning. Corsely finally reconciled him to his situation by taking him upon his
                     shoulders; but an unfortunate stumble in midstream, which sent both parties,
                     torch and all, completely under water, only made the matter worse, and the
                     curses more loud and furious.
                  It did not increase his good humor at subsequently learning that the vivandiere
                     had caused the driver to go through the river without stopping.
                  The travelers marched along gaily enough until midnight; but over the last
                     twenty miles the mud was the deepest that ever weighed down the feet of a
                     soldier; the crowd subsided into an almost unbroken silence, and even the
                     stories and adventures of Wheelhanney were for once discontinued from pure
                     weariness and exhaustion.
                  One or two of the party still carried torches, while the rest trudged on in
                     silence at their side. It looked picturesque enough to any one lingering on
                     behind to see these figures toiling along by the flaming lights, but a headlong
                     tumble from some steep and unexpected bank would soon warn the laggard of the
                     danger of such contemplations and incline him to keep to the
                        head.
                  At last the daylight dawned—at last the sun rose midway in the heavens, the
                     last river had been crossed the travelers had put their feet upon the
                     train.
               
               
                  VII.—Arcades Ambo.
                  A couple of hours later, the cars had entered the Macon depot. The ladies had
                     been placed in an omnibus moving towards a hotel, and Wheelhanney, upon whom
                     the whole charge of the ex-vivandiere now depended, was exasperated to the last
                     degree by being compelled to search for some of her boxes and bundles. "I am
                     getting rather sick of this," he said to Corsely. "We shall part company
                     to-morrow."
                  At the hotel where the travelers stopped for the night, the 
                        vivandeire
                        vivandiere
                      dressed herself in what had been once one of her most effective stage
                     costumes—that is to say in a yellow robe, with a border of blue a foot wide, a
                     crown or chaplet set with glass cries, and with earrings, breast pin, etc.,
                     upon a similarly gorgeous scale. Thus arrayed, she had compelled Wheelhanney to
                     register her name and take her in to supper. He submitted to the infliction
                     with the best grace, for fear of another scene, but vowed that he would yet
                     obtain his revenge.
                  Wheelhanney soon had additional fuel added to his discontent. After supper he
                     had been drinking about in the different bar-rooms of the city, and it was not
                     until a late hour that he thought of retiring. Obtaining a key from the clerk
                     he then proceeded to the room indicated as the one he was to occupy with
                     Corsely. About the time he had half finished dressing, the house was startled
                     by frightful screams and outcries, and by frequent discharges from a revolver.
                     The wretched Wheelhanney was compelled to lose no time in making his escape.
                     Somebody (and that somebody a lady) had chosen to appropriate his room instead
                     of the one that had been assigned her, and which was not quite so good, and
                     Wheelhanney thought he could guess who the somebody was.
                  The next morning, Wheelhanney, with a determined expression of countenance,
                     escorted the ex-vivandiere to the depot. He saw her upon the train. He also saw
                     that her trunks had been placed on board and the rest of her baggage cared
                     for.
                  Just as the train was in motion, with an air of distress, he entered the
                     ladies' car, holding in his hand the brass checks for her baggage.
                  "But why do you give them to me—are you not going?" inquired the lady, in a
                     tone of surprise.
                  "No; I am the victim of an accident—my trunk is left behind. You never saw a
                     man more put out in your life than I am," replied the traitor.
                  "You have left your trunk behind on purpose, then—on purpose to avoid me; but I
                     shall stay behind too."
                  "I had hoped that you would perhaps be willing," Wheelhanney answered, "but
                     unfortunately the train is in motion already. Goodbye, madam—a prosperous
                     journey."
                  A volley of reproaches and abuse was the only answer to this civil speech; and
                     partly to escape being overwhelmed by these, partly to prevent being carried
                     away, Wheelhanney was about jumping off.
                  But it was not his design to remain over a day, and looking out of the car
                     window the ex-Vivandiere discovered that another train was starting at the same
                     time from the depot.
                  She now readily guessed that he had previously checked his baggage upon this,
                     and upon this it was evidently his intention to enter. It was the direct train
                     to the West (Columbus), whereas the one upon which he had placed his
                     unsuspecting escort would go by Atlanta, and would be detained behind hand a
                     day. The two trains were actually passing out together.
                  "And you are really going to leave me alone in this way?" said the artiste.
                  "We shall 
                        met
                        meet
                      in the Heaven," said Wheelhanney within an air of great sorrow.
                  "Ah, traitor, it shall not be so."
                  The conductor, attracted by her manner, at this moment entered.
                  "He has robbed me, conductor," she shrieked in his ears. "Arrest him—he is a
                     spy and has no furlough."
                  Wheelhanney at this moment glanced through the car window and saw the train
                     containing Corsely and Danie in actual motion. The last that was seen of him,
                     he was struggling with the conductor and guard.
               
               
                  VIII.—Fall of the Curtain.
                  Corsely, as the train passed out, shouted to Wheelhanney where to rejoin him if
                     he should be left.
                  However, added the latter to Danie, as their car moved away, and left
                     Wheelhanney behind, "there is no need of telling him."
                  "But why not?" said Danie. "Shall we see him no more?"
                  "You are right; we shall see him no more, or when we do, the vivandiere will be
                     his wife."
                  (Corsely's prediction came true.)
                  The train, meanwhile, in which the latter was seated with Danie, was in
                     motion.
                  "It is our last day together, Miss Danie. I must consequently be very happy.
                     Smile upon me your sweetest smile."
                  "He has spent all of his money," thought Danie, "and yet he gives me up without
                     thinking of that."
                  "We have but one more day to remain together," said Corsely to Danie. "Fortune
                     will then give to each of us a 
                        kaleidiscopic
                        kaleidoscopic
                      shake, and we must go our different ways."
                  Danie cast upon him one of those imperceptible quivering glances with which
                     women regard and judge of the character of men.
                  "It has been a singular journey to me thus far," she said as the cars halted at
                     a station; "are we to meet with any more incidents?"
                  "Possibly," said Corsely; "we have but to travel to ——— a distance of a few
                     miles, before we again change cars. In fact," said Corsely, "we are nearly
                     there already."
                  "You are very generous, Mr. Corsely—the most generous man I have ever seen. You
                     are not going to leave me now?"
                  Corsely, not being at all quick of invention, did not know what to say. He had
                     transportation only in a certain direction, and hesitated to tell her that he
                     no longer had any money.
                  "Did you not hear, Mr. Corsely? Are you then so glad to get rid of me?"
                  "No, Miss Danie, I was endeavoring to remember what you have already told
                     me."
                  "And that was—"
                  "That you do not love me."
                  "I know nothing of you, except that you are a soldier too poor to take care of
                     me."
                  "You are some distance from home, and you are surrounded with a thousand
                     dangers. Meet my blind confidence half way."
                  "It is easy to say; but in what way?"
                  "One sometimes draws blanks, sometimes prizes—happiness or misery."
                  "And the inference?"
                  "If you had known from childhood the man you are to love, you would not be
                     certain of your future."
                  "Still you have not told me what you wish me to do."
                  "If your cold judgment inclines you against giving me your love, you ought,
                     still, situated as we all are, to take a little risk."
                  "I agree to be generous—to meet you half way."
                  She took a little heart, that she had been wearing as an ornament, from around
                     her neck: "I shall hold this charm," she said, "in one hand or the other. If
                     you guess now rightly in which it is concealed, the heart and hand will both be
                     yours. Is that meeting you half way?"
                  Danie for a moment held her hand behind her, and called upon Corsely to decide.
                     As the latter now glanced at her, he saw that her face, though pale, was
                     resolute.
                  "Are you then superstitious?"
                  "To some extent. Yes."
                  "And you are resolved to abide the test?"
                  "If you win I am at your disposal. If you lose need not again ask. Choose."
                  "In that case," said Corsely, watching her hands and every change in her face
                     with the most observant attention, "in that case as the left hand is nearest to
                     the heart, (there was a slight quiver of the eyelid and a faint gesture with
                     the hand in question,) I would take that if it did not argue too much hope on
                     my part, and if your sex did not go by contraries."
                  Corsely had thought he detected something like a faint smile upon the face of
                     Danie as he proceeded.
                  He therefore elected, in a firm voice, to take the right hand.
                  The smile increased. A deep color suffused her face. Lowering her eyes she
                     slowly opened the hand in question and displayed the heart.
                  
                  "I am the slave of the talisman," she said.
                  "Yes, and I intend to obtain title to my property. We shall be married when the
                     train stops for the night."
                  Danie demurred, but was reminded that she had no rights in the matter.
                  Rightly to understand the causes that contributed to this situation, it should
                     be remembered that it was the last month of the war. No one was certain of
                     retaining possession of any species of property. Food was scarce; the railroads
                     were liable to be cut at any moment, with no hope of repair. In case the last
                     accident happened, a lady who could not walk could not continue her journey.
                     Situations in which every one found themselves thrown could not be disposed of
                     by the two ordinary conventional rules.
                  Thus surrounded, and meditating upon the happiness that appeared in store for
                     them, the lovers were at length suddenly started by a report that the road on
                     before them had actually been cut. The report was distrusted, and ultimately
                     proved untrue. But it suggested an idea to Corsely, which he hastened to try to
                     put in execution.
                  "Humor one of my whims now," he said, "and if you had ever any cause to be
                     grateful to me, I shall consider the debt repaid."
                  "I am no longer free, I promise you in advance, it is only a whim."
                  Corsely now approached one of the passengers, and a whispered conversation of a
                     few moments followed. A similar whispering took place between himself and
                     several other travelers. Finally, the train stopped at a watering station, and
                     there was a gathering around Corsely's seat.
                  "But what is the meaning of all this?" Danie now eagerly inquired, in a low
                     tone.
                  "The gentleman with gray hair, you must remember as the chaplain who assisted
                     at your mother's interment. He has kindly consented to unite us instead of
                     awaiting our arrival at the end of our journey, and the other passengers are to
                     be witnesses."
                  "Are you really asking me to get married, and that right away—to you whom I
                     never saw until five days ago? Impossible!"
                  Another whispered conversation followed between the two, in which it could be
                     seen that a great many arguments and pleas were made use of to induce a
                     postponement of the ceremony. Then, with much fear and trembling, and a
                     blanched expression of countenance, Danie took the arm of Corsely, and the
                     other ladies and gentlemen took their places as attendants and bridesmaids. A
                     quartermaster contributed a blank, such as was used in making out requisitions
                     for commissary stores, upon which to sign a contract, and this document was
                     witnessed, partly while the train was in motion, by the autographs of most of
                     the passengers.
                  The marriage was un fait accompli. Corsely,
                     who had been so long in the army that he felt doubtful as to what else was to
                     be done, sealed the contract with a kiss, and a generous soldier, who had a
                     canteen of whisky, made the occasion still more happy by devoting it to
                     drinking (most of it himself) the health of the new couple.
                  "You are badly frightened," said Corsely, whose own nerves were far from being
                     steady.
                  "I have passed through so many troubles and dangers," said Danie, "that I shall
                     end by not being surprised at any situation. If you should prove to be a man
                     whose name is stained with dishonor, I believe I should yet recover and survive
                     the blow."
                  "And you are not troubled as to our future means of living?"
                  "But I had always supposed your sex was more disquieted by such considerations
                     than ours."
                  In answer to this, she 
                        quitely
                        quietly
                      took from her pocket a key, and applied it to a little case that she
                     had thus far carried in her lap. Opening this, Corsely was astonished to
                     discover in it a considerable quantity of diamonds, ear-rings, and a large
                     amount of other jewelry.
                  "You do not seem to be in any great danger of dying immediately from want,"
                     said Corsely, a little surprised.
                  "Oh no, my greatest valuables are sewn up in my dress. I have a bill of
                     exchange and enough coin to serve us for the present—my presence will not
                     greatly embarrass you."
                  "But you left me under the impression that you would be dependent upon
                     relations whom you had never seen."
                  "I should have been under their care to some extent and control. But my mother,
                     at her death, was on her way to reside upon an estate she owned in this portion
                     of the South. I suppose this will still remain to me as her only heir. If you
                     are not ambitious we can live upon it and be happy—"
                  Corsely had been astonished before. At this, discovering that he need entertain
                     no fears for the future, his face fairly beamed.
                  "Faith," said he, "it's not so awkward position, after all, to be the husband
                     of a pretty woman, when you have no fears for rations. Had I known how well
                     prepared you are to take care of me, you would have perhaps found me a much
                     bolder suitor."
                  "You would not have been on that account the more dangerous. Your prospect of
                     winning would not have been brilliant had you not been ignorant, and truly
                     shown yourself generous. You gave away what little you had to help me when you
                     thought there would be no repayment, and it shall not be my fault if you do not
                     find me a loving friend in the rest of our journey through life."
               
            
            
               A WATERING PLACE STORY.
               A trip across the Lake to this city is not an unmitigated evil in itself. The last
                  time I made it I had the company of Mr. Rockfellow to enliven the voyage.
                  Rockfellow is an old friend of mine; and though long separated, our friendship
                  suffered no diminution through the injuries of time.
               Not much caring about politics, and indifferent as to the state of the country, we
                  spent our time in pouring out such libations as the bar-room afforded, in smoking
                  cigars in sweet unison on the deck, or in citing up a thousand happy days when war
                  was not and a good Havana was, and when Bourbon and peach had not as
                  yet given place to rifle-cannon and tangle-leg.
               It is true our boat was not one of the best, and if you got out of the heat of the
                  sun, you got into the heat of one of the steam-pipes, and you couldn't get into
                  either place without being deafened by the noise of its machinery. At night, too,
                  you had to lay down on the deck, with the stars for your canopy, a fresh breeze
                  blowing in at one ear and the steam-pipe dripping leprous distillments into the
                  other. If you made your way into the cabin, it was over a pavement of prostrate
                  forms, and you were pursued by swarms of mosquitoes, who hovered around you like
                  guardian angels, but who none the less carried on a guerrilla warfare. Sleep, in
                  short, was not in accordance with the times, and so we fell to talking of the
                  past.
               "You are not married yet, Rockfellow?" With an old friend, I am much more curious
                  about his domestic than his political status.
               "Not yet: but I have just escaped from one endeavor. I've made up my mind that
                  it's a necessary evil—it will come somehow. 'You are bound to repent,' says
                  Socrates, 'whether you go in or stay out of it.' I wish to submit at once, as to
                  have done with the question. But about my escape. You see I had gone to get out of
                  the heat of the weather to a small place upon this side of the lake"——
               "Stop: you are evidently going to be tedious. Give me, at least, the consolation
                  of a fresh cigar and a light. Now for it, Rockfellow?"
               "Well, it was about dusk, and for want of something better, I strolled listlessly
                  down a magnificent avenue, bordered on either side with neat residences. At the
                  prettiest and trimmest of them all, I saw a servant issue from the front gate, and
                  then stop to listen to a message from what appeared to be the owner of the
                  mansion:
               "Stop, Phœbus. When you return get the bracelet of Miss Montressor at the
                  jewelers."
               "It was not that I thought there was a chance of stealing the bracelet, but the
                  message made an impression upon me. I turned to look, and I saw that with the
                  gentleman who had just spoken there were two well-dressed ladies, whose features I
                  could not see. Still I had no hesitation in deciding in my own mind which was Miss
                  Montressor. The name sounded at once familiar and romantic. Where had I met with
                  it—in history, fiction, or in real life? At that moment I should have given
                  something to have had the entree of the house,
                  and I cursed the malignity of my star in not having given me some
                  introduction.
               "After walking a little distance, I turned and retraced my steps. The two unknowns
                  were now walking with their arms twined lovingly around each other's waists, and
                  as if to aggravate my unhappiness, were laughing and chattering in the best
                  possible spirits. I soon afterward met the same servant returning.
               "Well, Phœbus," said I, putting my hand in my pocket in a way that I knew the
                  rascal would understand, "there are two ladies at your house—"
               "'Yes, sir. Mighty nice ladies, but they don't live with us—on a visit like. The
                  widow lives just opposite—'
               "Never mind the widow. But Miss Montressor—"
               "'Yes sir; she's a visitor too; Miss Edith they call her—'
               "What! Not from New Orleans?"
               "'That's just the place she comes from.'
               "Well, that is all I wish to know Phœbus. She is an old acquaintance of mine." I
                  gave him his promised reward and immediately resolved on calling after supper.
               "I dressed with care, and soon afterward sounded the bell with the hand of a man
                  who felt sure of himself. My summons was answered by the gentleman of the
                  house.
               "Now, before I go any further, let me tell you what reminiscences the name of Miss
                  Edith had awoke.
               "During the war, the company to which I belonged had been compelled to remain a
                  day in the town of L——, owning to an accident to the train. The citizens gave us a
                  huge reception and the run of the place. At that time, there was a female college
                  there, and its commencement exercises were just then taking place. The young
                  ladies of this institution were not behind hand in their welcome, and rivaled the
                  citizens in the warmth of their reception. When the stage was covered with pretty
                  girls in white dresses and blue ribbons, you may be sure some of us were among the
                  audience; and when they unfolded and read from the learned scrolls which they held
                  in their hands, and into which the garnered wisdom of three or four years had been
                  compressed, they looked into our eyes for approval. I was myself so much affected
                  by the arguments of one of those compositions, entitled 'Love at First Sight,'
                  that I ventured to take a seat behind the authoress when she had quitted the stage
                  and sat among the audience, and telling her that at New Orleans I had seen her
                  somewhere—at the house of a mutual
                  friend—that I should esteem myself miserable if I quitted the town without knowing
                  her, and ended by begging her to accept my acquaintance without further ceremony.
                  The lady met me half way—listened politely to my compliments, and at parting,
                  intimated that if I would call upon her that evening, she would carry me in her
                  carriage to a very pleasant party, and that I might then discourse further upon
                  that of which she had something heard. I jumped at her offer. I called at the
                  appointed hour, and found her resplendent in satin and kid slippers. My brass
                  buttons were none the less her joy and pride. Our acquaintance was an entente cordiale from the first, but as the evening
                  advanced, our feelings became altogether gushing—it was difficult to say which
                  gushed the most. Her manners seemed to say, 'Do not hesitate—make love hard;' and
                  the hint was not lost upon me. The language was squeezed dry of love-making
                  superlatives in the expectation of hearing her every moment cry for mercy; but not
                  she—not so much as a whimper fell from her lips. The supper hour found us further
                  advanced than ever; the room was deserted before we noticed the sordid appetite of
                  the meaner throng, and consented to abandon the banquet of love for coarser fare.
                  Reaching the supper room door, another short respite was given us; the room was so
                  crowded we could not enter. We consoled ourselves by promenading up and down a
                  long dimly lighted corridor—lounging behind the large pillars, and eventually—for
                  really it was quite warm—by moonlight strolling in the garden. There was but
                  little supper left for us. But what did souls like ours care for supper? Drinking
                  what little champagne there remained, we bade adieu to the garish crowd. In short,
                  we spent the whole evening in running through the gamut of love, and when we
                  parted the subject was well nigh exhausted.
               "It was lucky, as we marched the next day, and I had never seen her since. The
                  whole thing was a mystery to me, which was none the less increased when I heard a
                  few weeks afterwards that she had married an eminent soap manufacturer. After that
                  last piece of news, I need not tell you of the difficulty I had in remembering the
                  name of Miss Edith Montressor. And as I stood there at the door, I was just as
                  ready to encounter another sentiment as I was four years before.
               "But to return to my muttons. I entered the parlor, and was in the act of
                  executing my best bow, when I discovered I had never met either of the inmates
                  before.
               "I stammered out that I had expected to see Miss Montressor.
               "'That is my name,' said one of them.
               "But Miss Edith was the first name of my friend."
               "'Edith also is mine,' was the perplexing reply.
               "At any rate you are not from New Orleans."
               "'Indeed I am—you must really excuse me for laughing.'
               "I began to lose my temper. I was about to tell her that I would not attempt any
                  further examination, when our host came to my relief. He told me, which was true,
                  that if mistaken in one friend, I had forgotten another—although his acquaintance
                  was but slight; and that I must allow him to present me to the ladies. 'We were
                  playing cards, you must join us,' he said.
               "I thought it best to accept his invitation and sat down near the same lady. A Mr.
                  Christado Vantrump, a slim young man, with baggy side-whiskers, made up the
                  party.
               "I am completely at a loss to understand this mistake of mine," said I, recurring
                  to our first conversation.
               "'It is very simple. I have a cousin of the same name.'
               "I felt infinitely relieved, as my blunder was natural enough; but I did not quite
                  recover from the effects of my gaucherie. It was
                  with difficulty I followed the rules of the game. In spite of the romantic
                  introduction, I found the company of Miss Montressor only moderately interesting,
                  and so far as she was concerned, would have been gladly away. But her friend, of
                  whom I have hitherto said nothing—she sat motionless, except when turning over the
                  leaves of a book. She was dressed in deep mourning, and with her eyes downcast,
                  fair complexion and regular features, it was difficult to avoid being struck. If
                  she did not notice me, I on the other hand could scarcely keeP my eyes off of her,
                  I would have given something to have been the book upon which she gazed or
                  affected to gaze so earnestly. There was a slight expression of coldness about her
                  face, which disappeared when you had looked longer, and if it remained it was with
                  the angelic froideur which tempered the coquetry
                  of the mortal. It was doubly irritating to see a face which looked so soft and
                  easily won, and yet which would not waste on you the half of a glance. In short,
                  the game of cards was finished, music at the piano furnished, the usual
                  commonplaces said, and not a word to or from the unknown. Her friend called her
                  Zephine once during the conversation, and seeing there was nothing more to be made
                  by remaining, I bowed to the company and retired.
               "Just as I had reached the front door my good fortune, which I had been accusing
                  of neglecting me, came to my rescue, and gave me a signal proof of friendship. At
                  the moment that I was closing the front door, I heard my name called. Turning, I
                  saw the lady addressed as Zephine standing near me.
               "'I did not well understand your name at the time of your introduction. Am I
                  correctly informed that you are the brother of Louise C——?'
               "Your information is correct, Madam."
               "'Ah, we were old school friends. You must really tell me something of Louise
                  before you go.'
               "The task was pleasant; a slight branching off upon other topics was not forbidden
                  nor difficult. I soon found myself uttering fine talk with, as I imagined, immense
                  success. However, it shall be no excuse for repeating it to you. Suffice it to
                  say, Bishop Berkely's Tar Water Treatise never wandered farther from the point
                  whence we started than did we—or rather than did I, for I was the principal
                  speaker.
               "'I can see now that I might have enjoyed myself better than with my dull book,'
                  she said as we parted; 'but Miss Edith will be accusing me of making love to you
                  in the dark, if I keep you longer. Good night. Shall we see you again?'
               "It will be a pleasure—that is if it does not interfere with your literary tastes.
                  Good night.
               "Walking home, I had doubts whether, on the whole I had not rather been let in by
                  my visit; but it did not keep me from repeating it a few evenings after—in the
                  hopes, this time, of getting even.
               "My second evening resulted in a conversation with the interesting party of some
                  fifteen minutes duration. We spoke of Longfellow and Tennyson, of whom I knew
                  little, and of whom and of others of the tuneful throng I endeavored to express
                  myself sententiously. My companion listened politely—toyed with a book upon the
                  table, held it in her hand, and without appearing to be aware of it, found a
                  turned down leaf with her finger. At this stage it needed but little argument to
                  induce me to become again a partner at whist.
               "At my next interview I actually succeeded in getting a seat by her side, and
                  holding military possession of my ground for more than an hour. A soft languissant look was the immediate fruits of my
                  success; and the whiskers of Vantrump, who was a miserable looker-on, became
                  limper than ever. However, perhaps not to render him too wretched, she took his
                  arm at the expiration of that period, and promenaded with him the balance of the
                  evening in the portion.
               "One more call and my success was still more doubtful. I had the moderate
                  satisfaction of meeting her just as she was leaving the city, to be gone several
                  days. It is true I had the pleasure of squeezing a prettily gloved hand. But then
                  Vantrump was seated in the drag beside her, and would see her off. For a little
                  more, he might have driven with her to the deuce and I would not have actively
                  interfered.
               "An absence, however, of a week induced me to congratulate myself upon my
                  perseverance, and the first day of her return, to show that I was deserving of it,
                  found me again in attendance. The weather was raw and chilly; the fire would not
                  burn, and I soon found both truthful but inauspicious omens of defeat. The
                  conversation was a drag. I endeavored to impart to it a certain elevation; it
                  descended by a swift gradation into bathos. I really would have given a thousand
                  dollars to have stayed away. As it was, I was tempted to jump out of the window
                  and leave my hat in the hands of the enemy. I determined to go and stay away.
                  Another call, I was afraid, would not have met with any attention at the door.
               "But that night, about the hour of retiring, I was summoned to meet Phœbus, with a
                  message from his master. A vague alarm had seized upon the community. Every
                  household felt unsafe that had no male protector. He therefore asked me to go over
                  and spend the night at Zephine's. I need not say I forgot my complaints and
                  went.
               "In answer to the door bell, a trembling voice asked, 'Who's there?'
               "I explained my coming.
               "There was no mistake about my reception now. It was the most joyful greeting that
                  had yet fallen on my ears.
               "'I send you a kiss of welcome through the glass,' said she, applying at the same
                  time her lips to the surface in question.
               "I can wait and receive it in person, unless you intend that I shall keep watch
                  out here with Carlo on the door mat.
               "'The key is misplaced, you will not have to wait long.'
               "Looking through the pane, I saw that the dress of the speaker was white, though
                  black was her usual costume. I did not understand it at the time, but the
                  appearance of a servant soon after without a candle threw some light upon the
                  matter. I had been as impatient to get in as Sterne's starling was to get out; but
                  on entering, my shadow rapidly retreated before me, uttering as she disappeared a
                  Parthian 'good night.'
               "To console me, I was placed in a room which was redolent with the presence of
                  Zephine; a pair of gloves, a corset and hoops were scattered around, and afforded
                  food for reflection. By way of more fully entering into sympathy with their fair
                  owner, I tried them on, and when I sank to rest in my bed it was only to dream of
                  the usual fair tenant of this pretty nest.
               "I met her the next morning at breakfast; her conversation put me in the most
                  amicable mood. I was requested to still continue on guard. I spent my days in the
                  same house with her—now a short conversation—now listening to her music at the
                  piano, or contentedly reading her favorite works until she herself should find
                  time to amuse me; I was happy, and I realized my halcyon days while enjoying
                  them.
               "I flattered myself that the roughest part of my road was over. Our conversation
                  more and more approached to the tendre, and I
                  was already dreaming of traveling the rest of the way over life's road in the
                  matrimonial coach, with her as my partner. The whiskers of Vantrump no longer
                  darkened my prospect. More than once I had thought the little hand which rested on
                  my arm trembled, and her voice grew short in some of our delightful promenades and
                  conversations.
               "But I must hurry on, for yonder is the landing, and I see everybody getting their
                  things together.
               "A little while after there was a picnic given on an island, and a sort of boating
                  excursion. On that day I resolved that I should make the decisive advance. For a
                  while everything looked propitious. I pride myself on my rowing—I succeeded in
                  getting a light boat and a jolly pair of oars for myself and fair cargo—of course
                  it was Zephine. While others were toiling heavily, we were skimming along like the
                  birds that barely touched the water with their wings. Still I met with one
                  dreadful contretemps. On landing, whom should I
                  see but Miss Edith—the Miss Edith whom I had attended to the party. To meet up
                  with your old love before you are on with the new, you will admit is a little
                  embarrassing. Added to this, as I now saw her, she was not all pretty and had
                  grown very stout.
               "I thought, by way of commencing the conversation and giving her a hint of the
                  change in my feelings, it would be best to congratulate her on her marriage, of
                  which I had heard a vague report.
               "'Why, what do you mean by speaking of my marriage. I married! You are the last
                  that ought to accuse me.'
               "But—"
               "'It is unkind of you, to say the least of it. I did not expect it of you.'
               "But I assure you—"
               "'And to think that I should have been looking forward to meeting you so long a
                  time!'
               I contrived to get sway as quickly as I could, sincerely hoping that no one had
                  paid attention to our conversation, and wisely determined to keep as much out of
                  the way as possible.
               "Again I was favored. The rest of the day we ate and fished and danced, and I had
                  fully recovered my spirits.
               "Finally, I had found myself alone with Miss Zephine, and in a short, sharp and
                  decided manner I had 'popped.' Her answer was not quite so decisive, but it left
                  everything for me to hope.
               "'How many times have you told the same story?' she blushingly asked me, as we
                  walked toward the boats.
               "'Never—that is, very much in earnest,' I stammered out.
               "'But, then, Edith's manner this morning. She has been looking at you, too, all
                  day.'
               "'I never met her but once before.'
               "'I believe you, of course, but one might have thought you had addressed her from
                  the way she spoke.'
               "I had not time to say more, as meanwhile we had reached the landing, and found
                  that most of the party had already embarked. Vantrump had had the impertinence to
                  seize upon our light conveyance of the morning, and there was nothing left us but
                  a flat-bottomed concern into which Phœbus, with his baskets and boxes, was already installed. Still, in the
                  happiness of the moment, I did not much care, and leaving one of the paddles to
                  Phœbus, I had caught up the other with a will, and taken my seat at the stern. But
                  we were not destined to get off so easily. Just as we were about starting, Miss
                  Edith discovering that there was more room in our boat than the one she was in,
                  determined to give us the benefit of her company. I tried to get off before she
                  could move, but I was too late.
               "Knowing what I had to expect, I talked loudly, desperately, madly, on general,
                  uninteresting subjects, in the hopes that she would never find an opportunity of
                  being indiscreet. I paddled frantically in order not to lose a moment in getting
                  to the shore. But my struggle was useless.
               "'I have scarcely seen you a moment to-day, Mr. Rockfellow,' she at length
                  said.
               "I muttered something about being flattered by her show of interest.
               "'I feel that I have been neglected. Do you not think, Zephine, that he has been
                  very ungallant?'
               "'That depends somewhat—'
               "'But we are intimate friends.' I could then hear her companion give her a sort of
                  sketch of our first meeting. My heart died within me.
               "'Meanwhile the sun had gone down and it was beginning to grow dark. Phœbus took
                  advantage of the tete-a tete to whisper his
                  fears to me about the safety of our flat-boat.
               "Why, what's the matter with it, Phœbus; no danger of sinking?"
               "'There's a big knot-hole stopped up with a plug near you, and if it should happen
                  to come out! 'Pears to me there's heap of water in it already.'
               "In my desperate mood a bright idea occurred to me. I felt the plug with my
                  foot.
               "Well, it don't make much difference, Phœbus, if she does sink. You can swim,
                  can't you?"
               "'Oh yes, sir—like a fish.'
               "Well, in case our craft should happen to sink, you know, you must take care of
                  Miss Edith."
               "'I can keep her afloat and me too—mighty easy.'
               "'What is that you are saying about floating and sinking. Oh, my feet! What is the
                  matter,' said Miss Zephine.
               "'There is no danger—dearest Mr. Rockfellow—tell me there is no danger,' said
                  Edith.
               "We were within about a hundred yards of the shore. The rest of the party were
                  waiting for us. I saw the hated Vantrump stroking his whiskers contemplatively as
                  we approached the shore, and the thought that he might succeed maddened me.
               "You won't do anything of the kind, 
                     Vantromp
                     Vantrump
                  . I will yet win her," I muttered to myself.
               "'Lord, massa, dis here boat's gwine to do bottom, sure.'
               "Nonsense. There has been water in the bottom all the time. Pull away at your oar.
                  We'll soon be there."
               "Here there was a shriek and a scream. The boat was actually going down. 'We are
                  drowning—we are sinking.' 'Save me'—no, you must save me,' and other similar cries
                  rent the air. Savage as my breast was, their prayers and cries made me wish the
                  plug back in its place.
               "However, it was too late now for regrets. With extraordinary presence of mind I
                  seized Zephine in my arms, and telling Phœbus to imitate my example, I leaped
                  overboard. What the rascal really did, I had no means of knowing, as I saw nothing
                  more of him until I was safe at land. But he certainly was of no assistance to
                  Miss Edith—perhaps because she did not give him time. She, when she saw me
                  leaving, frantically sprung after me. With a grip from which there was no
                  extricating myself, she clasped me around the throat. I hardly know how I escaped
                  from my rash experiment partly, perhaps, to help being close at hand, partly to
                  the shallowness of the water. When I was at length brought to the shore I was
                  senseless. Nearly everybody had disappeared before I recovered. My attempt to
                  distinguish myself had proved a complete failure. Vantrump had saved Zephine from
                  drowning, and had ridden home with her wrapped up in shawls. Every one had abused
                  me and attributed the accident to me. Two of the ladies declared that I was a
                  little monster, and that it would have been a Providence, and would have taught me

               TWO TRAGIC HISTORIES.
               
                  PART I.
                  An Almost Forgotten Biography—Singular Adventures of a Notorious
                     Character.
                  A sort of hidden link binds and brings together, for good or evil, certain
                     characters whom destiny wills should not be apart. They find themselves
                     jostling against each other without previously dreaming of it, and influencing
                     each other's fate by ties of friendship or hate, and in a way which neither can
                     understand when too they imagine themselves thousands of miles separate. An
                     illustration of this principle is suggested in a history which is still
                     frequently talked of in this city, and which, owing to the military occupation
                     at the time the most tragic event occurred, has never been fully published.
                  A short time before Gen. Walker made his first expedition to Central America,
                     there was seen on our most fashionable promenades a young man whose appearance
                     attracted no little comment. According to some accounts, he was one of those
                     handsome, well-dressed figures, more frequently seen in this city than
                     elsewhere—one of those men with flashing eye, dark complexion, curly hair, and
                     well-shaped moustache, who form one of the principal characters of almost every
                     novel, and occasionally of some of the scenes of real life. Others spoke of him
                     as a bravo in appearance with the sombre and sinister look of a man predestined
                     to crime. Be this as it may, and whether his eagle gaze indicated a man born to
                     command, or one who was in search of prey to carry off, the stranger made
                     himself popular with the young men of the town by his social qualities and by
                     his excelling in the use of arms and other manly accomplishments. The name he
                     was destined to become well known by was that of Capt. M——. At the date at
                     which he is now introduced, he had commenced the practice of law under
                     promising auspices, and what, perhaps, added to his prospects, the lawyer in
                     whose office he had made his novitiate, had just lost his life by a steamboat
                     explosion, and M—— was left in sole charge.
                  In this state of affairs, M——, with two friends, Capt. D—— and a young man
                     named C——, had been together during an evening, and instead of returning to
                     their homes at night, concluded to take rooms together at the Orleans Hotel. In
                     the morning, M—— left the room very early. Some time after, D—— getting up
                     found that his pocket-book containing $500 had disappeared. The supposition
                     among the friends was that M—— had taken the money, and in a subsequent meeting
                     Capt. D—— slapped his face.
                  A duel was thereupon agreed upon, but D—— having been remonstrated with by the
                     friends of M—— as having formed his suspicions without proof, and as therefore,
                     having dealt a blow unjustly, he subsequently apologized. The apology only
                     postponed trouble. M—— made so much noise about the apology that at a
                     subsequent meeting his face was twice slapped by the same party.
                  They at the time were at lunch at the Metropolitan coffeehouse, at the corner
                     of St. Anne and Conde, near Chartres street, at the time the blows were dealt,
                     and that M—— then held in his hand a carving knife. The injury was not,
                     however, resented in any other way than by a challenge.
                  The meeting then took place at the old dueling ground on the Metairie Road, in
                     what is now the Park. At the hour appointed, a crowd of two or three hundred
                     were found to have been collected. Messrs. John McC—— and Valery D—— acted as
                     the seconds of M——; Messrs. C—— and T—— as seconds to D——. In going to the
                     ground, M—— appeared resolute and not lacking in purpose. Once, however, he had
                     reached there, he became pale and distrait;
                     he was, evidently, not himself. He complained that too many people were
                     present; that he preferred that the duel should be postponed to another day. No
                     concessions could induce the principal to take his appointed place. As the
                     matter now stood, according to the code there remained nothing for the first
                     second of M—— to do, but volunteer in place of his principal. This unlucky duty
                     fell upon Capt. McC——, and upon doing so he was not a little astonished to find
                     that his offer was accepted by the seconds upon the opposite side. The weapons
                     were those generally used among our Creole population, small swords or
                     colichemards. D—— and McC—— were armed with these, and now set to work in good
                     earnest—M—— meanwhile looking on. The combatants had actually made several
                     passes, when the further continuance of the fight was interrupted by the
                     protests of one of the attendant physicians.
                  The fight ended and the matter amicably arranged, all of the parties, except
                     M——, shook hands and returned to the city in the carriages. The latter stood
                     upon the ground motionless and silent, like one stunned and paralyzed by the
                     extent of the disgrace that had overtaken him, and who yet had no power to
                     avert the degradation that would henceforth stare him in the face. His
                     appearance betokened a man who was blasted and ruined. The last that was seen
                     of him he was in this attitude, overwhelmed by the curses heaped upon him by
                     both sides now retiring, and by the jibes and jeers of the spectators,
                     exasperated at his want of courage, or at having been deprived of the pleasure
                     of seeing a duel.
                  A few years afterward one of the beforenamed parties, in company with Mr.
                     Eugene P——, met M—— at Biloxi. The latter had now abandoned all dreams of
                     success at the bar—was then behind a bar-room counter selling liquor, and
                     pretended not to recognize either party. Although the establishment was his,
                     two or three days after he had sold out and left for parts unknown.
                  The next heard of him was after the return of Gen. Walker to the city from the
                     Nicaraguan war. It now appeared that M—— had there served with him as colonel
                     of a regiment, and, according to all accounts that were given of him, he had
                     acted with great courage and gallantry.
                  
                  At the visit of Gen. Scott to this city in 1856 or thereabouts, M——, in
                     compliment to his brilliant services in the Nicaraguan war, was appointed to
                     act as a marshal of a grand procession that was to take place. He proved to be
                     a magnificent rider, and upon the day in question he was placed upon the right
                     of Scott's carriage in the procession. Unfortunately for the Grand Marshal his
                     old second, McC—— had been assigned to the same duty upon the other side of the
                     carriage, and his happiness at being confronted with the man who was best
                     acquainted with his past history was that of Damocles, with the sword suspended
                     over his head.
                  After the procession, the marshals, some twenty-five or thirty in number, and
                     some of the guests, were invited by Charles Waterman, subsequently Mayor, to
                     partake of champagne punch. M—— was then formally introduced to the assembled
                     guests, and among others, to his old second. The latter denied, during the
                     presence of Waterman, that he had ever met M——, and a formal introduction took
                     place. As soon as Waterman had disappeared, M——- was asked what a man of his
                     character meant by being there. He replied, by saying, that he had been away,
                     and had redeemed himself, and begged not to be exposed. McC—— told him it was
                     not his affair, if he could swim and no one else knew it, to go ahead.
                  The advice was given as taken, and avoiding the men who had formerly known him
                     his history again disappeared in shadow until the war. When next seen his role
                     was not of the most brilliant character. He was, in fact, a recruiting officer
                     of his own appointment. His plan was to find out what young men were anxious to
                     volunteer for the war, and to then sell them to parties wishing to fill up
                     their companies. Sometimes he would make arrangements with the parties at the
                     Workhouse for procuring a certain number of men. However these might have been
                     obtained, M—— was nowise particular in disposing of them, and is said to have
                     received $500 for thus disposing of a dozen men.
                  He continued thus occupied until the arrival of the fleet,
                     and then left for Secessia. Nothing was there heard of him except that for an
                     alleged embezzlement of money he was pursued by Major John P—— and Capt. B——,
                     with strict orders to arrest him.
                  The latter having reached Mandeville, were pointed out a schooner about a mile
                     distant from the shore, and which was said to contain the man they sought.
                     Throwing cloaks over their uniforms, and armed with a six shooting musquetoon
                     and a navy revolver, they proceeded in a boat to where the schooner was lying.
                     Upon mounting the aides of the schooner M—— was found on board. As to what
                     there happened no one but those present ever positively knew. Fifteen days
                     after they were seen leaving Mandeville in a boat, the bodies of P—— and B——
                     were seen floating upon the water. B——s body was found near Mandeville. P——s
                     body was found near LaFreniere. The families of the deceased were written to in
                     this city. The body of B—— was sent here by friends from over the lake. The
                     body of P—— was subsequently sent for—Gen. Banks giving a permit, and Capt.
                     McC—— was entrusted with the mission. He succeeded in bringing back the body
                     and regaining the city after having had the coffin searched, and himself and
                     others who were in his company stripped of their clothing to prevent the
                     surreptitious transmission of letters.
                  The whole affair awakened an immense deal of excitement and great feeling among
                     all classes of residents, and the funeral rites were celebrated by one of the
                     largest corteges that took place during the war. Some opposition at first had
                     been made by Gen. Banks to allowing anything like a public demonstration to be
                     made over the corpse. It was, however, known that Major P—— had once been
                     thanked in a printed card for the kindness he had shown to certain Federal
                     prisoners who were placed under him, and in requital of this act Gen. Banks,
                     when appealed to, allowed the funeral to go on.
                  To return now to M——, he had succeeded in reaching New Orleans and entering the
                     Federal lines. After taking the oath of allegiance, he was arrested by the
                     authorities upon the barge of having murdered P—— and B——. The counsel he then
                     employed was Thomas J. Durant. A Coroner's jury was summoned to sit upon the
                     bodies, of which Capt. John H. McC—— was a juror. The body of P—— was examined
                     by Dr. Shuppert and Dr. Stone. No wound was found. The death was obviously from
                     drowning, and so the jury decided, after the examination of the captain and two
                     sailors. According to their account, it appeared that P—— and B——, upon
                     boarding the vessel, had called upon M—— to surrender, which he did. They then
                     ordered the captain of the schooner to go to shore. This order was being
                     executed when the boom, owing to the shifting of the wind, swung around and
                     struck them so violently as to throw them both overboard. The Captain of the
                     schooner made for the yawl immediately, but was prevented from lowering it by
                     M——. The latter now told him not to stop, to put up all sail, and get to New
                     Orleans; that he would be certainly hung in case he was carried to the
                     shore.
                  From the testimony of the Captain, they were still in the water endeavoring to
                     keep themselves afloat, the last that was seen of them. A fresh breeze
                     springing up, the schooner sailed direct to New Orleans. After a struggle of
                     five days over the evidence, the drowning was pronounced accidental, and all of
                     the parties released. M—— was taken into the Federal service as a detective,
                     and Coroner Beach, who had held the inquest without military permission, was
                     discharged from his office.
                  We have protracted our account too far to dwell more upon the adventurers of
                     M——. Soon after the events last described, he left the city and never returned,
                     except furtively. The last time he was ever seen here, some three years ago,
                     was in the dusk of the evening, and at the sudden turning of a street. Singular
                     as it may seem in a narrative which pretends to give only the literal truth,
                     the party whom he now met with was his old-time acquaintance, who had acted as
                     his second in the duel. The two men stared at each other, mutually astonished
                     at the meeting, and remained for a moment or so without speaking.
                  "Is it safe for me to remain in the city?" inquired Mancosas.
                  "You are too well known. On the contrary, I counsel nothing of the sort."
                  "What, then, is your advice?"
                  "It is that you take the first boat from the city, and never return."
                  M—— seemed to attach a mysterious importance to the advice of a man whose fate
                     appeared to be so frequently thrown in contact with his, and from that day to
                     this has never been seen in the city.
               
               
                  PART II.
                  An Episode to the 
                        Preceeding
                        Preceding
                     .
                  In New Orleans, during the darkest night or one of our gayest seasons, a few
                     years ago, some of the down-town visitors to the Opera, who were hurrying home
                     at a late hour, were startled to observe the form of a young girl, who sat half
                     crouched upon what appeared to be a step of the old cathedral. The sight of the
                     homeless and destitute is common enough to those whose occupation keeps them on
                     duty through the silent watches; but the singularity in this case was that the
                     iron railing, which was locked, had been scaled; and furthermore, that in spite
                     of the inclemency of the weather, the attitude of the young girl was one of
                     prayer, rather than that of rest.
                  When her situation had attracted the attention of compassionate passers by, it
                     appeared that she had been there through half the night listening to the chimes
                     of the old building striking the quarters and half-hours, and endeavoring to
                     nerve her mind to a desperate plunge in the great and but little-distant
                     stream.
                  The account given below is the poor girl's own statement of her history, as
                     related to Capt. C——, by whom she was rescued. The story is given in almost the
                     precise manner in which it was then told:
                  "Until recently I lived with my mother in comfort in the country, at no great
                     distance from the city. The recent general financial disasters which affected
                     others affected us. We became very poor. It was not a great while ago that we
                     disposed of even those ornaments which had been the gift of friends.
                  "I now determined to endeavor to obtain some situation in the city. In this
                     attempt I succeeded. Accompanied by my mother, I was fortunate enough in
                     finding a home as English teacher for the younger children of a small school.
                     The inmates of the latter appeared kind and well-disposed. In fact, I was so
                     well pleased that my mother, no longer entertaining any anxiety upon my own
                     accounts soon afterward returned home.
                  "During the lifetime of a brother I had heard him speak frequently of an old
                     law classmate and intimate friend under the name of M——. In a city where
                     everything to me was new, you may imagine my happiness at meeting with him by a
                     charming accident, and at finding that the prepossessions I had already formed
                     were not disappointed. His manners were pleasing—in disposition he was
                     good-natured, and he was well-mannered and never wearied
                     with explaining the  objects that excite a young girl's
                        sympathy. At places of amusement and at religious
                     services he was my constant companion.
                  "We were playing some domestic game with a party of friends one evening, which,
                     but for a single incident, I might remember as the happiest of my life. It was
                     the well-known game of cards in which your condition in life, whether married
                     or single, is told. Several of the circle had already had their lots decided on
                     in this manner. M——'s name was at length proposed.
                  "'Yes, tell us whom he is to marry,' said one voice, with a meaning glance at
                     myself.
                  "Our fortune-teller, who was a lady that had been introduced to me that
                     evening, appeared to demur.
                  "M—— now, as did several of the party, demand to know his fortune.
                  "'Do you wish me to tell you whom you are to be married?'
                  "'Certainly,' he answered, though with rather a hesitating manner, 'why should
                     you doubt it?'
                  "'There is one reason that occurs to me——'
                  "'And that is——'
                  "'Because you are married already.'
                  "The declaration produced a profound sensation. For several minutes there was
                     not a word spoken. Every eye was turned on me.
                  "After an attempt, with indifferent success, to change the subject of
                     conversation, M—— made a cold and formal statement to the effect that he had
                     never deceived me in the matter—the only party to whom he thought any
                     explanation was due.
                  "To this speech I knew not what answer to make. To contradict this statement—to
                     say that it was untrue in every particular—I thought would have been showing
                     that I was interested in the matter, and though, too, his statement was to me
                     as a blow, I could not help feeling, in spite of his duplicity, a certain
                     sympathy. I was unwilling to see that we must forever part; and helpless and
                     far from my home I wished to discover some palliation for the conduct of one
                     who was almost my only male acquaintance.
                  "The consequences of my silence were momentous for me. I discovered that it had
                     done, him no good, and had irretrievably ruined me in the good opinion of my
                     new acquaintances. The only explanation they could see to my conduct was, that
                     I had been receiving the marked attention of a married gentleman, and wore as a
                     gift from him a magnificent diamond ring, whose status I had concealed in order
                     not to attract attention.
                  "The rest needs hardly to be told. I received a small pittance that was due me.
                     I was to be sent home in disgrace. I could not see the man who had betrayed me,
                     and, beside, he had left the city.
                  "Do you wonder now at my situation, and the desperate thought which placed me
                     where I was?"
                  "No, I do not wonder," said the Captain; "partly from what you have told me,
                     partly from an obvious circumstance you have forgotten to mention."
                  The girl held down her head.
                  "What you allude to," she said, "is too true. If I live I shall become a mother
                     before becoming a wife."
                  "Listen," said the Captain. "You have no relations here, and scarcely any one
                     else knows you. Return to your hotel to-night, which I will assist you in
                     finding. It will be easy to arrange on our way there, without your committing
                     suicide, that your disgrace shall not be known. Will you promise to go by my
                     advice?"
                  The promise was given; the girl was attended to the place at which she stopped,
                     and animated by the advice that had been given, she proceeded the next morning
                     to put it into execution.
                  Dressed respectably, and with the air of one accustomed to society and
                     refinement, she disposed first of her ring at a pawnbroker's, and next appeared
                     at the office of one of our noblest charitable institutions. The officer in
                     charge having been summoned, the lady, without raising her veil, begged to
                     become an inmate of the asylum, in a strictly private apartment, and where she
                     could be seen by no one but the surgeon in charge. The request, after some
                     stipulation as to terms, was complied with. She was now entered on the books by
                     certain initial, and was assigned to a ward where no visitors were
                     admitted.
                  Six weeks afterward, the inmate had given birth to a child—had recovered from
                     the effects of sickness. She had disappeared without attracting inquiry in an
                     establishment where a dozen each patients are annually received; and with
                     feelings hardened by suffering and resolve, was once more returning to her
                     mother's residence.
                  One night during the last year of the war, a soiree was given in spite of the
                     ominous situation of affairs, in one of the small cities of the interior,
                     around which an army was encamped, and which was then much frequented by
                     officers. The Captain, who had met up with the young girl in the manner already
                     recorded, was now in command of a company, and upon the evening in question,
                     together with other officers ficers of
                     his regiment, had been invited to attend the house where the party was to be
                     given.
                  Nothing occurred for some time after his arrival. The Captain, who, as a
                     soldier, felt certain of his appetite, but doubtful, under the circumstances,
                     of making much of an impression in the drawing room, remained much nearer the
                     former than the latter, and was little seen or heard of.
                  It did not, however, prevent him from glancing occasionally into the main
                     reception room, and from making some inquiries. His attention having been in
                     this way pointed to a married lady, remarkable for her style, self-possessed
                     air, and the homage which she received, the Captain soon found himself
                     endeavoring to remember where he had met the face before. Shortly after she
                     passed near him and hearing her voice at the same moment that he caught her
                     eye, the Captain made an involuntary start. The moment after he was in the hall
                     that led to the supper room, and was gazing at the preparations for the feast
                     as if buried in thought.
                  In this reverie he was interrupted by a tap with a fan on the shoulder.
                  "Do you remember me?" said in a low tone a woman's voice at his side.
                  The Captain, after hesitating a second, replied civilly that he did not.
                  "You are very generous or discreet to deny a knowledge that you think might
                     give me pain. But it is easy to see from your face that you do know me."
                  "Since you insist, Madame, upon recognizing one whom I would naturally suppose
                     you would be anxious to forget, permit me to inquire how you succeeded in
                     obtaining position and fortune where most persons are losing them?"
                  "I am married. My husband is wealthy."
                  Some farther conversation followed, and the Captain, who had heard of the
                     history of the husband and wife without ever previously identifying them by
                     name, was soon made master of the whole story.
                  "I think," said he, "that I saw you a moment ago leaning upon the arm of the
                     gentleman with dark complexion and prominent moustache. I ask not from
                     curiosity, but merely to advise"—
                  "That you must know, as you are both from the same city, is Mr. M——. You have
                     probably already guessed that I have known him for several years."
                  "If you have, after knowing him so well, again become inseparable friends there
                     is hardly any need to make a remark as to his character."
                  "He has persuaded my husband to embark his wealth in the purchase of cotton and
                     in getting it out of the country. I have several times obtained permits on both
                     sides. allowing its transmission through the lines. He has the faults of men,
                     still he would not endeavor to defraud a woman."
                  The Captain shrugged his shoulders, and the interview ended by inquiries on her
                     part and answers on his as to the hands into which her child had been placed,
                     and where it might be subsequently found.
                  
                  Among the most noticeable inquests held during the past year was that of the
                     Coroner upon a body found on Customhouse street, in one of those houses in that
                     neighborhood kept by quadroon landladies, and occupied mostly by single
                     gentlemen. Entering under a covered alley-way, the visitor, after proceeding
                     some distance, found himself in a dark courtyard, adorned by a few poisonous
                     looking flowers, and to which the presence of one or two
                     clumps of banana trees gave a rather melancholy appearance. Climbing up a badly
                     lighted stairs, the Coroner was shown into a suit of rooms filled with
                     furniture of the costliest pattern. A heavy, canopied bedstead of dark wood,
                     whose curtains were agitated by the wind, first arrested the attention of the
                     visitor in entering, and the sight of a body immediately beneath, prevented the
                     gaze from wandering further. The features were wasted, and bore about them the
                     unmistakable pallor of death, but were still fine and expressive, and the hair,
                     which was disheveled, was remarkable for its glossy length. A vial, containing
                     laudanum, tightly held in one of the hands, almost obviated the need of any
                     inquiries.
                  The explanation given of the matter by the turbaned landlady was that, some
                     years previous a child had been entrusted to her care to raise, and supposing
                     it to be the offspring of a wealthy party, or parties, who had a temporary
                     reason for concealing its birth, she had raised it—the more, too, as she had,
                     until recently been liberally paid for its maintenance.
                  Upon the previous night, about the hour of retiring, the deceased had knocked
                     at her door, and having explained that she was the mother demanded to see it.
                     Her appearance was in last degree haggard and worn at entering the house. She
                     looked stunned and bewildered when informed that a short time previous the
                     child had died. She recovered herself subsequently enough to speak. She had
                     demanded a room, and had said that she would not need one long—that she was
                     shunned by her relatives, and betrayed and ruined by those she had considered
                     her friends, and that see did not care to live.
                  M——, whose name had been mentioned in connection with that of the deceased, was
                     summoned as a witness, and looked on thoughtfully as the body was being
                     dissected. He coupled the use of the scalpel by the surgeon with a
                     philosophical remark:
                  "One must dissect their best known acquaintances in order to understand them
                     thoroughly."
                  "By knowing them thoroughly you perhaps mean, knowing how most thoroughly to
                     profit by their misfortunes," said Capt. McC., who, at this moment entered;
                     "but you, M——, ought in any case, to have spoken of her as a friend rather than
                     an acquaintance, since, after robbing and ruining her through life, you will
                     now get paid as a witness after her death.*
                  
                  
                     *The characters and incidents in the second portion of this story are not
                        given as having had any connection with the party who was arrested and
                        discharged by a coroner's jury upon the charge of having twice committed
                        murder, in the inquest held upon the bodies of Major P. and B.
                  
               
            
            
               CELEBRATED COMBATS.
               
                  I. The Duel on Horseback.
                  There never was but one duel on horseback in this country, and that occurred
                     near New Orleans in the year 1836. The parties to this novel combat were both
                     Creoles.
                  One of them was Lieut. Shamburg, who a few years before the events we are about
                     to relate, had been appointed to that elite regiment, the Second Dragoons.
                  Shamburg was a man of herculean strength and splendid appearance. He united
                     French vivacity and German power. The officers of the Second Dragoons were a
                     choice set of high-spirited, gallant, dashing fellows. Thoroughly instructed
                     and practiced in riding and in the sword exercise, they were naturally proud of
                     their skill, and were regarded by civilians as a little swaggering and
                     overbearing in their bearing and manners. Now it happened that a quarrel and a
                     personal conflict arose between Lieut. Shamburg and Adolph Cuvillier, a popular
                     and gallant young Creole, of a family noted for the fighting qualities of its
                     members. Cuvillier was a slightly built, lithe and graceful young man, of very
                     popular manners, uniformly polite, urbane, generous and manly. Compared with
                     Shamburg, Cuvillier, recalled to the mind of the readers of Scott's novels the
                     contrast between Saladin and Richard Cœur de Lion, so beautifully sketched in
                     the Crusaders. In the street combat, which had taken place between them,
                     Cuvillier proved altogether unequal to his adversary, whom, however, he charged
                     with taking an unfair and cowardly advantage, by the use of a knife or dagger.
                     Cuvillier therefore challenged Shamburg to a mode of conflict which, by the
                     equality of its conditions, would afford him a better test of the courage,
                     which he, the challenger, held in serious doubt. Now, as Gen. Jackson had
                     declared that he would not allow the officers of the army and navy to fight
                     duels with citizens, Shamburg was very reluctant to accept the challenge, and
                     made great efforts to escape it. But Cuvillier was immovable in his purpose and
                     insatiable in his ire against his foe, and followed him with such pertinacity
                     that, by the advice of his brother officers of the dragoons, Shamburg
                     determined to accept the challenge and fight on his own terms. It was, no
                     doubt, expected that those terms would be regarded so unusual and
                     unprecedented, that they would be declined, and the duel thereby prevented, and
                     Shamburg escape the penal consequences threatened by the President. These terms
                     were, to fight in a ten acre lot on horseback, with cavalry swords; the parties
                     to be stationed one hundred yards apart, and to charge each other at the word
                     and fight it out a cheval. Shamburg selected
                     as his seconds Dr. Smith and Captain Thurston, both of the regular army, who
                     communicated to the seconds of Cuvillier the terms upon which alone the
                     challenge of the latter could be accepted. Such terms were universally
                     condemned by the whole fraternity of the men of honor, or subjects of the Code,
                     as violative of all the sentiments and principles of that Code, as inequitable
                     and unmanly, as such, in fact, as only bravos and those who rely upon brute
                     force would prescribe and demand. On the other hand, in justification of
                     Shamburg and his seconds, it was urged that he desired to avoid the combat and
                     escape the penalty of fighting a duel, and had claimed his technical right to
                     select his weapons in expectation that the other party would decline, and the
                     affair thus be quashed.
                  But this calculation proved an erroneous and delusive one. This might have been
                     known beforehand, when the names of Cuvillier's seconds were handed in. These
                     were the names of the most gallant, determined and experienced combatants in
                     New Orleans. No two Creoles had higher reputations for prowess, skill, heroic
                     courage and inflexible honor and chivalry than Mandeville Marigny and Emile
                     LaSere. The former, a son of the famous Bernard Mandeville de Marigny, the
                     descendant of a long line of distinguished seigneurs of the old Normandy
                     aristocracy, had been educated in Paris, under the eye of Louis Phillippe, his
                     father's old friend and guest in that monarch's day of adversity. Mandeville
                     had been sent to France at the solicitation of the King, and was made a
                     companion and classmate of the Duke of Orleans, who was of the same age as
                     young Marigny. He received a thorough military education at Saumur, and at an
                     early age was commissioned for the cavalry, but, seeing little chance of active
                     service, returned to New Orleans to look after the enormous estate which his
                     father was squandering in the most reckless style. There was no more
                     accomplished or elegant gentleman among the Creoles of Louisiana than
                     Mandeville Marigny, at that period. Though a very dangerous man to quarrel
                     with, his character has always been remarkably mild, amiable, and even
                     phlegmatic.
                  His associate on this occasion, and, indeed, throughout life, exhibited a
                     remarkable contrast with Mandeville Marigny. Emile LaSere was then, and is now,
                     when advanced beyond three-score, one of the most excitable, energetic, intense
                     and fiery little men we ever knew. Scarcely above the height and weight of an
                     average boy of fourteen, he has always held his own, and, generally, towered
                     above the mass of his countrymen in spirit and manly bearing. His quick and
                     fiery nature involved him in many conflicts, from which he always emerged with
                     honor, and, generally, with victory. As generous and magnanimous, as passionate
                     and impulsive, his quarrels and combats always ended in the field. He has been
                     known to assist in staunching the wounds he had inflicted in a duel, and to sit
                     up long nights at the bedside of one of the victims of his own skill and
                     prowess. No man ever fought so many duels who was so free from the qualities
                     which belong to the professional duellist. In fact, his combats were prompted
                     by a real chivalry of nature, and by a quick temper, which sought the vent of
                     the duello, and with this escape, was succeeded by a generous and magnanimous
                     feeling toward his bitterest foe.
                  It was this same chivalric trait which made Emile La Sere the most reliable of
                     friends in a great emergency, and the most indomitable of resistants to
                     everything which had an aspect of domineering bravado, and presumption.
                  
                  It was in this light Marigny and LaSere regarded the terms communicated by
                     Shamburg's friends. They accepted them at once, only asking that a week be
                     allowed to make the necessary preparations for the combat. This condition was
                     conceded, and the parties set to work to prepare their principals. Cuvillier
                     had never had a cavalry sword in his hand, and was a poor equestrian. But he
                     was fortunate in his instructor and second. Marigny took him in hand, and
                     obtaining the use of a very spirited and docile horse, belonging to Mr. Ursin
                     Bouligny, the Sheriff of the Parish of Orleans, set to work to put Cuvillier
                     through a thorough course of cavalry exercise. His knowledge, experience and
                     skill in handling a horse and sword proved of great advantage, and his pupil
                     being apt and active, before the time arrived for the combat, Marigny had
                     turned out man and horse a complete and accomplished cuirassier. His own good
                     long, straight sword supplied the necessary weapon. The fine charger borrowed
                     for the occasion had been drilled to such perfect command and control, that
                     when mounted the agile and graceful Creole, looked the picture of a
                     Centaur.
                  The Carrollton Race Course was selected for the combat. This place lay along
                     the only railroad which then ran out of New Orleans and near the bank of the
                     Mississippi. From the decks of the steamers and vessels plying on the river,
                     every object on the race course was plainly discernible. Despite all the
                     efforts of the parties it was impossible to keep so notable an affair secret.
                     The combatants were so well known, even the horses selected by them had been
                     communicated to the public through the hints of glooms and stable boys. The
                     whole affair became the subject of much discussion, and indeed of several angry
                     and violent disputes, and of numerous and large wagers.
                  At last the day arrived, and though the hour selected was very early in the
                     morning, a large crowd had already clambered over the high paling enclosing the
                     race track, and occupied the seats of the stand and the limbs of the trees
                     which commanded a view of the ground. Col. Oliver, who was the lessee of the
                     track, had not only afforded its use for this special occasion, but, to give
                        eclat to the combat, he had loaned his
                     splendid milk white stallion to Lieut. Shamburg, who had practiced the high
                     spirited animal until he had become a thorough proficient in cavalry tactics.
                     Mounted on euch a charger, confident in his skill and strength, Shamburg felt
                     himself equal of the best dragoon that ever charged a squadron.
                  On the day appointed for the combat, the parties were promptly on the field.
                     The principals and seconds were all mounted, the latter being armed with sabres
                     and holster pistols. The principals had sabres only. Shamburg the U. S.
                     regulation broadsword, Cuvillier the long straight, heavy sword of the French
                     cuirassier. Everything proceeded with great regularity and propriety. The terms
                     were read out and the positions of the parties and of the seconds carefully
                     marked out. Stationed one hundred yards apart, at the words, "Charge—one, two,
                     three," the combatants were to advance upon one another and engage with their
                     swords until one or both was unhorsed, when the seconds should interfere and
                     stop the fight. In case neither was unhorsed in the charge, they were to wheel
                     when they reached the stakes and make another charge. There were other
                     conditions which were not very important. The combatants presented a gay and
                     splendid appearance as they trotted up to their respective positions. Shamburg
                     wore the undress uniform of the Second Dragoons, and handled his magnificent
                     milk white charger with the most perfect ease and skill.
                  Those who with their eyes measured the great breath of his shoulders, the
                     powerful muscular development of his arms, and his firm seat on his saddle,
                     trembled for the frail, delicate and effeminate looking Creole, who, mounted on
                     an elegant and apparently gentle riding horse, and donned in the ordinary
                     attire of a gentleman and civilian, moved with so calm and even cheerful an air
                     to take the position allotted to him in a combat apparently so unequal and
                     unfair.
                  The spectators, however, were not permitted to indulge in the reflections
                     suggested by the contrast of the two combatants before the word was given, and
                     the cavaliers putting spurs to their animals leaped forward to the conflict.
                     The highly trained charges rushed at each other with the fire and vigor of
                     veteran warriors, and their riders with their swords held aloft, fixed their
                     eyes upon each other with deadly resolve. Cuvillier having been practiced in
                     the 
                        Curiassier
                        Cuirassier
                      style held his sword straight forward from his body, whilst Shamburg
                     waved his broad blade over his head.
                  When they met it was with a tremendous shock of the horses, which nearly upset
                     the riders and gave them little chance of using their sabers with effect.
                     Shamburg's horse leaped aside and saved his rider from the desperate plunge of
                     Cuvillier's sword, whilst the latter, stooping to his pommel, escaped the
                     tremendous slash which Shamburg made at his head, the sabre, however, lighting
                     upon Cuvillier's hat and knocking it from his head. The impulse of the charging
                     horses had carried them some distance past each other, and they could not rein
                     up until they had gained the posts from which they had started. As Cuvillier
                     passed his second, LaSere, that quick eyed, active little man leaped from his
                     horse, and picking up his hat restored it to his principal. This charge had
                     been a barbless one. The only injury done was to Cuvillier's fine beaver, which
                     was pretty badly slashed, The horses were greatly excited, and by their fierce
                     eyes, foaming mouths and nervous demeanor, showed that they entered fully into
                     the spirit of the affair.
                  After a breathing spell, and a pause long enough to tighten their girths and
                     rearrange their bridles, the combatants again took their positions, and the
                     ominous query rang out, "Are you ready?"
                  The silence of all parties was the only response. Then followed the order:
                     "Charge! one, two, three."
                  With even more fury and fire than in the first rencontre, the cavaliers rushed
                     at each other. Just as the terrible collision was about to take place,
                     Shamburg's horse was seen to rear up, and Cuvillier's to plunge madly against
                     him, and his rider's sword, which was held forward, directed at the body of
                     Shamburg, passed through the neck of the noble animal, causing him to reel and
                     fall sideways to the ground, carrying his rider with him. The seconds rushed
                     forward and ordered the combat to cease.
                  Attention was then given to the wounded charger, who lay on the ground,
                     bleeding profusely. The grooms and hostlers were called, and his wound
                     examined. It proved to be a fatal one. The main artery of the neck had been
                     severed, and the noble animal soon bled to death.
                  The cavaliers and their friends returned to the city much mortified and
                     disgusted with the incidents and results of a combat which, it was thought by
                     many, would be a practical revival of the spirit and customs of the chivalry of
                     the Middle Ages. The spectators, too, were sadly dissatisfied with a conclusion
                     which suggested to them the bitter sarcasm that the more robust and noble
                     animal of the four had been the only sufferer from a rencontre, in which the
                     chief actors were actuated more by vanity and a desire for display and
                     sensational effect than by any sense of honor or resentment of true chivalry.
                     This was certainly not true, so far as it was applied to Cuvillier and his
                     gallant friends.
                  The whole affair was most repugnant to their tastes and feelings. It was only
                     their determination to resent what they considered offensive bravado, that they
                     consented to so unusual and, under the circumstances, so unfair a mode of
                     combat. The greatest sufferer in this affair was Colonel Oliver, the owner of
                     the slaughtered charger. The Colonel put a very high estimate upon his horse,
                     and demand was made upon Shamburg for his value. The question was fully
                     discussed who was responsible for the loss of the horse, and it was apprehended
                     that the dispute would get into the courts. Cuvillier declined any
                     responsibility, and Shamburg averred that it was not by his act or fault that
                     the horse was killed; that he was loaned with a full knowledge of all risks to
                     which he would be exposed, and that his death was an accident of the fortunes
                     of war.
                  We do not know how this question was ever determined, but the general
                     understanding was that Col. Oliver lost a very valuable horse.
                  This, we believe, was the first and last duel on horseback which ever occurred
                     in the United States.
                  The event served to illustrate a very common error, which prevailed among
                     Northerners and foreigners, that the Creoles would only accept the duello on
                     their own terms, and with the weapons in the use of which they were practiced
                     and skilled.
                  We have known a great many other illustrations of the falsity of this idea, and
                     but one case in which we ever knew of a Creole declining a combat on account of
                     the weapon and terms, and that is so ludicrous an incident, that we shall be
                     excused by our readers for relating it at length in a separate sketch. It may
                     serve, in its comical aspects, somewhat to relieve the grave and tragic
                     character of these sketches:
               
               
                  II. Harpoons—Twenty Paces.
                  We have said in our account of the duel on horseback, that the Creoles rarely
                     rejected the terms of combat, on account of the unusual character of the
                     weapons selected. Their sentiment of honor, however, condemned such resorts.
                     Whilst by the practical Anglo-American, who yielded to the demand of the code
                     against his own convictions and education, and only in deference to a prevalent
                     custom and prejudice of the society in which he had cast his fortunes, no such
                     scruples or ideas were recognized. His notion was to fight on the best and
                     safest terms for himself, and to use every advantage he might possess over his
                     antagonist, not forbidden by the express terms of the contract. Denouncing this
                     interpretation of the spirit of the code, the Creole deemed it unmanly to
                     decline the terms, though all unused to the selected weapons, and unskilled in
                     the mode of combat prescribed by the challenged party. We never knew of but one
                     exception to this rule of action on the part of this spirited race, and as it
                     is amusing as well as illustrative of the character of the two races, we will
                     here relate it:
                  Opposite to the upper suburb of New Orleans, on the right bank of the river,
                     lives Mr. J. M. Harvey, a gentleman who has lived a very adventurous life, who
                     emigrated from a Northern or Western State, some thirty years ago, and
                     intermarrying with a wealthy and prominent Creole family, has resided on a
                     large and valuable property near the city, and become a man of wealth and
                     influence. Previous to his settlement in Louisiana, Harvey had been engaged in
                     the merchant service, and had served his time before the mast and in several
                     whaling voyages. Having married a Creole, Harvey brought himself in connection
                     with a large and highly respectable circle of relatives and friends, to whose
                     ideas and tastes he found it essential to his social status that he should
                     strive to conform, but which were quite opposite and repugnant to his old
                     notions and feelings. The transition was certainly a very violent one to an old
                     skipper, whose ideas and tastes had been acquired on the deck and in the hard
                     service of a Nantucket whaler, to be suddenly called on to adapt his manners,
                     tastes and conduct to the highly refined ideas and chivalric rules which govern
                     Creole society.
                  Smollet, in the amusing adventure of Peregrine Pickle's effort to accomplish a
                     change of manners in one of his favorites, has afforded a precedent of the
                     difficulty of this task, which, in its incidents and results, strongly
                     resembled the circumstances of Harvey's efforts to conform to Creole
                     institutions.
                  There was a gay party at a Creole neighbors, which was attended by Harvey.
                     During the evening a game of cards was proposed; and the game was proceeding
                     quite pleasantly until an altercation arose between Harvey and a Creole
                     gentleman of high position named Albert F. The dispute finally wound up in
                     words of insult from Albert F. to Harvey, and in a knock down from the heavy
                     fist of Harvey, the blow inflicting a black-eye upon the unfortunate Creole.
                     Toe parties were separated.
                  The next day Harvey was waited upon by the friend of Albert with a demand for
                     satisfaction, and a request to be referred to his friend to arrange the terms
                     of an early meeting. Harvey asked him what he meant. The second replied he
                     meant that he should meet Mr. F. in mortal combat, and atone for the blow he
                     had given him.
                  "But," replied Harvey, "he grossly insulted me, and I returned the insult with
                     a blow. I think that makes us even, or if we ain't even I'll pay up the
                     balance."
                  The second was surprised to hear such a response from a gentleman who had
                     married into a Creole family, and as a mutual friend he would warn Harvey that
                     if he persisted in this view or his duty, he would be tabooed by all his
                     relatives. This suggestion somewhat alarmed Harvey. He was proud of his newly
                     attained social position, and would make great sacrifices to maintain that
                     position and preserve the respect of his relatives. Under the influence of
                     these feelings he asked his kindly monitor what would be the terms of the
                     proposed combat.
                  The second, brightening up at the success of his appeal to the "better
                     feelings" of Harvey, and at the prospect of a lively affair, quickly responded,
                     "Oh! of course, being an American, you have the choice of weapons."
                  The announcement was a great relief to Harvey, for he had already been notified
                     that F—— was an experienced duellist, skilled in the use of the weapons
                     generally employed in affairs of honor. He, therefore, asked with an air of
                     great simplicity, "what were the proper weapons to be used by gentlemen on such
                     occasions."
                  "Pistols, swords, rifles, shot-guns, or any dangerous weapon in which you may
                     be skilled."
                  This answer produced a visible impression on Harvey, whose face brightened up
                     with an expression of satisfaction and relief from an embarrassing dilemma.
                  "I understand you," he said, "and I will meet your friend on the terms you
                     state, and you can fix the meeting as to time and place to suit your own
                     convenience, I only stipulate as to the weapons."
                  "That is prompt and like a gentleman of honor. Please favor me with the indication of your choice of weapons, that I
                     may communicate to my friend."
                  "My weapons are harpoons, hickory handles, ten feet in length, distance twenty
                     feet. I have a brace of them from which your friend can make his choice."
                  The Creole's second was astonished, shocked, and puzzled. He had never heard
                     the word harpoon before; had been in a dozen duels with all sorts of weapons,
                     and never saw or heard of such an arm. Not knowing the French word for harpoon,
                     Harvey stepped into his office, and bringing out two formidable specimens of
                     that style of weapon which had seen good service in the Pacific, he exhibited
                     them to the astonished Creole as the dangerous instruments from which he would
                     concede to his adversary the right of choosing the one with which to avenge the
                     insult he had offered him. He took occasion to illustrate the manner in which
                     harpoons were handled.
                  The astounded and disgusted Creole exclaimed, "Why, sir, do you suppose my
                     friend is a fish, to be stuck by such a d—d tool as that?" "Fish or no fish,"
                     replied Harvey, "that is my weapon. Your friend is quite as skillful in
                     handling sword or pistol as I am with the harpoon. When I challenge him I shall
                     be obliged to accept his weapons, and now I claim my rights as the challenged
                     party to choose the only one which I feel I can see with skill and effect."
                     "But, sir, your proposition is bizarre, ridiculous, and will bring contempt on
                     all the parties engaged in it. This is a serious affair, sir, and I hope you
                     will treat it seriously."
                  "You will find it serious enough if one of those harpoons strike your body at a
                     distance of twenty feet," replied Harvey, at the same time going through the
                     harpoon exercise as practiced in whaling ships. The indignant Creole thereupon
                     retired in great disgust, reported to his principal, and the next day the
                     affair was reported through the city. It may illustrate the radical difference
                     of ideas of the two races, that whilst the Creole friends of Mr. F—— reported
                     the incident as one which reflected great disgrace upon Harvey, the
                     Anglo-Americans laughed over it most heartily as a rich joke and a fair satire
                     upon the absurdity and the unreasonable laws of the duello.*
                  
                  
                     *The two duels given above are from the pen of one of our best known city
                        journalists, and were incorporated with the present work at a time when
                        it was proposed to make it the joint contribution of different
                        writers.
                  
                  The above narrative of the facts was contested by Mr. Fabre, (as is nearly
                     always the case with any account of a duel ever written,) at the first
                     publication of the story, and the following statements were then made:
                  In August, 1851, I had a personal altercation with Mr. Harvey, in the course of
                     which I slapped his face and got a blow in return, after which we were
                     separated by the bystanders.
                  As this happened quite late at night and I had some business engagements in the
                     parish of St. Bernard, I requested my friend Maj. Z. Trudeau, then State
                     Senator for the parish of Jefferson, to call on Mr. Harvey early next morning
                     and arrange the terms of a hostile meeting, leaving to my opponent, as a matter
                     of course, the choice of weapons.
                  To this message Mr. Harvey made no response, simply declining to fight me with
                     any weapon; whereupon the whole matter was dropped.
                  No mention was made of "harpoons" by Mr. Harvey or his friend, but had he felt
                     inclined to fight at all, I feel certain that he would have been fully
                     accommodated.
                  I am no "duelist," but have never yet refused, and I hope never shall decline
                     to meet any man I might quarrel with, even should his preferences be for
                     "harpoons," tomahawks or meat axes for dueling purposes.
                  
                     Very truly, yours.
                     ALBERT FABRE.
                     New Orleans, June 21, 1869.
                  
               
               
                  III. A Street Duel.
                  About six months after the aforementioned duel, (that is, about 1852,) some
                     discussion arose one night in the political club room on Chartres street,
                     between Mr. Fabre and the celebrated John DeBuys, and after the meeting the
                     parties passed from words to blows. It was then about two o'clock in the
                     morning, and as the difficulty had taken place at the corner of Dauphine and
                     St. Peters streets, it was arranged that the disagreement should then and there
                     be settled by an immediate appeal to arms.
                  It so happened that Rosiere (the well-remembered fencing master) lived very
                     near the locality, and upon application to him a couple of swords were obtained
                     without trouble. Rosiere himself consented to act as second for DeBuys, and
                     Rene C—y, who had been with the party during the first quarrel, acted as second
                     for Mr. Fabre. Returning now to the street. the parties were assigned to their
                     places, at the corner of Dauphine and Toulouse streets, under a gas light.
                  The principals now crossed their swords and several lunges and passes had
                     already been made when the attention of a policeman, who happened to be passing
                     at the time, was attracted to the spot. Approaching the scene he called upon
                     the parties to desist, and attempted, without success, to compel them so to do.
                     Finding that no attention was paid to what he said, and that all of the parties
                     persisted, he sprang his rattle and soon had assembled at the scene a
                     considerable force of the police.
                  It now became obvious that the affair could proceed no further. It was
                     consequently arranged that the fight should be resumed upon the following day
                     at the old Orleans Ball Room.
                  At noon, therefore, as agreed, the principals were assembled at the designated
                     place. Mr. Fabre had now selected for his seconds George Price and J Nores. Mr.
                     DeBuys had as his witnesses Octave LeBlanc and Rosiere. The fight lasted about
                     ten minutes, and resulted in Mr. Fabre receiving two wounds. He was struck once
                     in the right arm and once in the breast. At this point the affair was
                     terminated by the seconds, and the parties reconciled.
                  It is perhaps worth while to remark that three years after DeBuys received the
                     fatal wounds, in his duel with Gerard, which resulted in his death.
               
               
                  IV.—Matrimonial Infidelity.
                  On the night of the 14th of January, 1869, the citizens in the rear portion of
                     the Second District were startled by the cry of murder, and frequent discharges
                     of firearms. Those who hurried to the spot saw a young man in the act of
                     falling lifeless upon the pavement, and standing near him and greatly agitated,
                     the surviving principal in the tragedy. In explanation of the homicide, the
                     following facts were elicited from various witnesses:
                  About one year before the war, Mr. Louis Martin, a young man then about
                     twenty-five years of age, and a jeweler by occupation, contracted a marriage
                     with the daughter of M'me Lavielle, a midwife from France. The latter had been
                     for a number of years one of the best and most honorably known practitioners in
                     her calling in the city, and having the skill, strong, steady nerves and
                     personal influence over her patients, which entitled her to success, was
                     rewarded in her last years by accumulating a considerable fortune.
                  It was her daughter, Camille, that Martin married just previous to his starting
                     to Matamoros to commence business. Martin was spoken of then, and ever since,
                     as a very quiet man.
                  Mme. Camille Martin, his wife, who is now at the most not more than twenty-two
                     years of age, was at that time said to be one of the handsomest girls in that
                     district. When before the Coroner, she appeared to be of small size, though
                     perfectly made. A brunette as to complexion, hair and eyes, with delicate,
                     almost perfectly regular features, and a slightly Spanish cast, communicated by
                     her heavy eyebrows and eyelashes.
                  Upon this daughter the mother, according to all accounts, spared no expense or
                     pains, either in education or in supplying the numberless whims of an only
                     child. Her manners and appearance indicated a woman somewhat capricious and
                     passionate by nature, and whose ideas had been affected by the imaginative
                     authors of her mother-tongue.
                  Martin having gone to Matamoros, remained there—most of the time in company
                     with his wife—until about two years ago. At that time he returned to the city,
                     and, assisted by Mme. Lavielle, was enabled to open a store at the corner of
                     St. Philip and St. Claude streets. He resided, with his wife and mother-in-law,
                     about fifty yards higher up on St. Claude street, in the direction of
                     Canal.
                  The homicide occurred on Wednesday night, at about half past 7 o'clock, up to
                     which hour Martin had been in his store. At that hour, rumor has it, that a
                     negro, who had been on the watch near Martin's residence, came and informed him
                     that a young man who figures in the narrative as Salvador Fernandez, was in the
                     neighborhood of his residence. Martin's own statement is that the meeting was
                     accidental. At the time the two men actually came together Salvador was seated
                     on the steps exactly opposite Martin's house.
                  The statement of one of Martin's clerks is, that when he left the store he did
                     not carry away any one of the knives ordinarily used there. This fact was shown
                     subsequently by actual count. Martin appears to have had a clasp knife,
                     according to the statement of witnesses, about five or six inches long. The
                     first thing heard of the difficulty was the exclamation made by Salvador,
                     "Assassin." This was heard by Mr. Cassard, who was walking immediately ahead of
                     Martin when the latter started from his store. Subsequently to hearing this
                     exclamation, Salvador fired three shots. The exclamation made by Salvador would
                     seem to indicate that he had been already stabbed. This statement is, however,
                     strongly contradicted by several of the witnesses. Martin was seen, at some
                     time during the struggle—either before inflicting any blows, as contended by
                     his friends, or after one or two of the shots had been fired, to retreat
                     several steps and stoop, in avoiding the shots, almost to the gutter.
                     Subsequently he sprung upon the body of Salvador, then prostrate, according to
                     the statement of Luchet. According to Snaer's statement, Salvador seems
                     afterward to have retreated toward Canal street, uttering cries of murder, and
                     when near the corner of Dumaine and St. Claude streets, (near the Lodge fence)
                     fell, for the last time, in the arms of Mr. Bozonier. A fact to be kept in
                     mind, in understanding the difficulty, is that the room of Fernandez was very
                     close to, or, according to some accounts, adjoining 
                        th 
                        the
                      residence of Martin. His presence in the neighborhood did not,
                     therefore, ordinarily 
                        ape pear
                        appear
                      singular, and the contiguity of the two residences accounted for the
                     frequency of the interviews.
                  Below are given the statements of Madame Martin, given in conversation, as to
                     what had preceded the tragedy:
                  "From the time I was eight years of age I knew Salvador, and from that time we
                     were raised up as children together. We were strongly attached, at the
                     commencement of the war, although I was then very young, and neither of us then
                     dreamed of loving any one else.
                  "After the city was captured by the Federal army, Salvador ran the blockade and
                     went to Havana. He subsequently succeeded in entering the Confederacy, and
                     remained in service until peace, as a Lieutenant.
                  "It was while he was thus absent that I heard that he had been killed in some
                     battle; and, after giving away to the grief naturally suggested by his death, I
                     thought myself absolved from the attachment which had previously existed
                     between us.
                  "Subsequently I accepted the hand of Mr. Louis Martin.
                  "The first time I saw Salvador was after the war, and at the time I was about
                     embarking for Matamoros. My husband had already become established in business
                     there, and I was going thither to rejoin him.
                  "Just as I was crossing the levee Salvador met me. It was the first time I had
                     seen him for years; and he showed by his attitude and manner that he loved me
                     as much as ever.
                  "I told him, when he asked me what I was about to do, that I was then on my way
                     to Matamoros. He reproached me with having married during his absence, and
                     begged me not to go. I explained to him that I thought he was dead. He said
                     that in that case I ought not to have married any one else.
                  "Finding that I was about going to Mexico, he begged me not to sail in the
                     Allison—the vessel upon which my passage was already engaged—but to accept a
                     cabin and berth upon a schooner belonging to himself or to a near relation. He
                     stated that in case I should be willing to travel in this way, that everything
                     should be placed at my disposal free of charge.
                  "I explained that I was under the protection of a relative, and that his
                     proposal was simply impossible. I then bade him adieu—the vessel set sail, and
                     I reached Matamoros in safety.
                  "After arriving there, I received a letter from Salvador telling me that he
                     would soon rejoin me. I promptly wrote back word that he must do nothing of the
                     sort; that the country was a miserable one, that I myself was weary with it,
                     and that I would shortly return to the city. It was not a great while after
                     that I did return.
                  "When I again saw him I was in conversation with a lady friend. Without paying
                     any attention to her he passed between us, turning his back upon her. I remonstrated and pointed out
                     his apparent rudeness to my friend. He gave as his excuse that he was so
                     agitated and happy at seeing me that he had forgotten every one else.
                  "Some time after, on Mardi Gras night, we met at the ball given at the New
                     Opera House."
                  [As to what occurred at this ball, it appears from the statements of third
                     parties that an adopted daughter of Mme. Lavielle had gone with Camille to the
                     ball, and that in one of the loges occupied by Martin and his wife, Salvador
                     had entered and paid marked attention to Mme. M. According to the statement of
                     Mme. Camille Martin, Salvador, in the course of a warm dispute, had been struck
                     by Martin. Be this as it may, when the adopted daughter returned home she
                     reported to Mme. Lavielle that she would never go to another ball with her
                     daughter Camille again—that she was extravagante, too light headed, and had acted all the evening, at
                     sight of Fernandez, as if out of her senses.]
                  The statement of Mme. Martin is now resumed:
                  "We subsequently met at the National Theatre, and some difficulty again
                     occurred between M.. Martin and Fernandez. Salvador and I had gone to the
                     supper room together and drank a bottle of wine. M. Martin became incensed at
                     this and demanded an explanation. Salvador then stated that he had known me
                     from a child; that he had always stood towards me as a sister—and that he would
                     eat, speak and drink with me when he pleased. Something was then said about the
                     parties descending to the banquette to settle the difficulty then and there.
                     The matter, as near as recollected, ended at the interposition of friends.
                  "We never became really lovers until St. Joseph's night following. At that time
                     I begged Salvador when we met to end our friendship—that he was really crazy,
                     and acting like a madman, and would inevitably ruin us both. He refused. He
                     said that he would love me as long as he had life, and both upon that occasion
                     and afterwards declared that neither I nor himself should ever survive a
                     separation. Indeed, more than one time he proposed that we should both take
                     poison together, and abandon life in each other's company. He had many
                     singularities in this respect, which I never could understand, and which made
                     me wonder where he could have obtained them.
                  "After the ball last mentioned, he was never willing that I should go out
                     unless in his company. He was continually telling me that he never went to any
                     reception upon my account, and was unwilling that I should go where I was not
                     attended by or certain of meeting him. When I went to the theatre or any place
                     of amusement, he always followed, and when I went out at night to visit any
                     private house, he also attended me. Upon such occasions I started from home
                     with a child as an escort, and Salvador would always be certain to rejoin
                     me.
                  "The principal trouble with him was his constant jealousy. He wished me to
                     leave my husband, reside with some of my relations and friends, and obtain a
                     divorce.
                  "About two months ago Salvador, hearing that there was to be a wedding to which
                     I was invited, and to which he was not, protested strongly against my
                     attending. Among other arguments he used to induce me to remain away, he
                     threatened to throw vitriol upon my dress just as I entered the house. Becoming
                     out of patience at what he exacted, I told him I would go and amuse myself if I
                     had to go there and dance in my petticoats. Subsequently, however, when the
                     time came, I did not go, and so I remained away, together with all of my
                     family, that would have gone with me.
                  "I saw Salvador almost every day; he was continually passing and repassing.
                  "The last time I ever met him was a few moments before his death. At that time
                     I told him it was impossible for me to see him that evening and begged him to
                     go away. He did so, but only went across the street to sit down upon the steps
                     of a colored man's door. Why he did so I could not understand. While he was
                     sitting there, my husband, who was expecting to collect some money from a negro
                     that had been owing him, passed along and recognized Salvador. I did not see
                     the difficulty, but I was subsequently told by my husband that he had stopped
                     on seeing Salvador and asked him if his name was Fernandez. S. had then
                     replied:
                  "'No—there's my name,'" and had drawn and discharged a revolver at the same
                     moment. From what had been told me, and what I knew of Fernandez's character, I
                     believe that he had fired first.
                  "At the time that the disturbance actually took place, I had commenced
                     undressing by the fire, and was taking off my shoes and stockings. When my
                     attention was called to the difficulty, I never for a moment suspected who the
                     parties were. I thought it was simply the discharge of a fire-cracker that I
                     heard, and ran to the door.
                  "Subsequently Martin entered the house and embraced me—telling me that he had
                     met Fernandez, and had killed him on my account, I lost my senses at the news
                     and scarcely knew what I said."
                  [One of the Coroner's witnesses, Henry Leanmont, when off the stand, stated
                     that the remarks of Mme. Martin at the time were: "You have killed Minouche—I
                     loved and lived for him, and will die for him," with similar exclamations
                     suggested by grief.]
                  "I did not at the time fully believe that Salvador was dead—I did not believe
                     it until the next day when I had seen the papers, and had spoken with Deputy
                     Coroner Espinola. It was this fact which caused me to visit his house (where I
                     was told that the body lay) at an early hour in the morning. It was this
                     ignorance which caused me to subsequently ask the Deputy Coroner to tell me
                     about Salvador—whether he was dead or alive.
                  "As for M. Martin, he never doubted, or showed that he doubted, of my love at
                     any time during our marriage. On the very evening that the homicide had been
                     committed, before leaving the house, I had told him of a dream that I had the
                     night previous, in which I had fancied myself dead. At that time he had
                     protested that such an event could not happen, or if it did, that his body
                     should be cut into a coffin for my remains."
                  Martin was tried for the homicide, but was acquitted. He subsequently sued for
                     a divorce from his wife.
               
               
                  V.—The Spanish-Cuban Duel.
                  On Sunday morning, the 8th of May, 1809, a duel between Pepe Llulla, a native
                     of Spain, and Carlos de Mayer, took place above Carrollton, and resulted in a
                     dangerous wound through the breast to the latter—the Cuban principal.
                  For some days preceding the affair, the Crescent City had been variously
                     agitated with rumors of quarrels and duels between our Spanish and Cuban
                     population, growing out of the struggle in the "Ever-Faithful Isle," and
                     several such difficulties had attracted the attention of the authorities since
                     the commencement of the Cuban war. Those of the previous week, however, had
                     been the result of the large torch-light demonstration about a month before in
                     favor of Cuban independence, at which speeches were made and vives shouted, which gave deep offence to Spanish
                     residents.
                  Their especial cause of complaint was a banner borne, or alleged to have been
                     borne, in procession, bearing some such motto as "Death to Spain," "Death to
                     Spaniards," and that such cries were raised as the Cubans marched through the
                     streets.
                  The demonstration led to some angry recriminations and lengthy publications in
                     the journals, and to the issue of the following card:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              To the Cuban Refugees and those who sympathize with them:
                              The undersigned, a European Spaniard by birth, and who was brought
                                 up in New Orleans, is desirous of responding on the field of honor,
                                 and in any way they may indicate, to those who, in their meetings
                                 and processions in this city, have shouted "Death to Spain," "Death
                                 to the Spaniards!"
                              And whoever might desire to take up the matter is requested to
                                 address himself, either personally or through his friends, backers
                                 or seconds, to the undersigned, from six to eight o'clock in the
                                 morning, at the corner of Congress and Moreau streets, or in the
                                 afternoon, from two o'clock till dark, at the office of the
                                 Cemetery on Louisa street, Third District, to obtain whatever
                                 satisfaction he or they might desire under the penalty, should they
                                 fail so to do, of being looked upon as impostors, cowards and
                                 contemptible boasters.
                              
                                 PEPE 
                                       LLULA
                                       LLULLA
                                    .
                                 New Orleans, May 4, 1869.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Pepe Llulla or Joseph Llulla, whose name is signed to the above, is a gentleman
                     fifty years of age, who has been residing in this city for the last
                     thirty-three years, and is well known all through the Third. For the last ten
                     years he has enjoyed the reputation of a quiet and prosperous citizen, devoting
                     his time to his cemetery. His previous history was, however, of not so quiet a
                     character. The last of the bull fights ever given in this city came off under
                     his auspices upon the other side of the river. At the time of the Spanish riots
                     here some years ago, Pepe Llulla was a large sufferer and had nearly everything
                     he owned destroyed.
                  At one time he taught fencing, and he has the reputation of having the
                     strongest wrist of any man in the profession. His skill in fencing, or with the
                     "white weapons," is, however, no greater than with firearms. He has been known
                     to shoot the pipe out of a man's mouth a dozen yards off, and has frequently
                     shot nickels out of the hands of his friends.
                  As duels at that day were matters of every day occurrence, it need hardly be
                     stated that Llulla had some excellent opportunities for showing his skill. He
                     has probably fought more duels than he can now remember, and being a man of
                     strong, steady nerve, fond of danger, and ready to fight a saw mill if occasion
                     should arise, Pepe, though naturally good natured and of a popular turn, for a
                     good many years had a stormy time of it.
                  A response to Llulla's placard, which was posted about the streets, and even
                     upon the door of one of the Vice Presidents of the Cuban meeting, was received
                     on Thursday. Upon that day the name of Carlos de Mayer, who had resided and
                     perhaps been born in Cuba, was presented to Llulla and a verbal acceptance of
                     the challenge given. Llulla thereupon pointed out the fact that the demand was
                     not in writing, and named Alfred Wiltz as the gentleman who would serve as his
                     second.
                  Upon the following day Messrs. Diaz and Anguera, as the seconds of Mayer, made
                     a formal call upon Mr. Wiltz and Charles Culbertson, (the
                     latter selected as the adviser of the former,) and after two or three hours
                     discussion no agreement could be arrived at as to the choice of the weapons,
                     both parties claiming to have the right to the choice.
                  Upon the following day, with Messrs. Hernandez and Fernandez as interpreters,
                     the weapons named by the seconds of Mayer—the regular dueling pistol—was agreed
                     to by Llulla's friends. The latter, however, insisted upon naming the distance
                     of twenty-five paces, and the principals to fire at will, as the method of
                     settling the dispute. This was agreed to, and the Sunday following was
                     appointed for the meeting at 9 o'clock, and the grounds the Metairie
                     Course.
                  Previous to starting the seconds met at a gunsmith's, on Royal street, to mould
                     the bullets and to select weapons which had never been used by either party.
                     This point arranged, the principals, who had not been far off, were added to
                     their number, and the whole party now proceeded to the Metairie Course.
                  Arrived there, a large crowd it appeared had got wind of what was to take place
                     and had already arrived upon the ground. The party thereupon immediately
                     continued upon the shell road to Carrollton, and between 10 and 11 o'clock
                     found themselves in an open field about a mile in the rear of that town.
                  The toss up was now won, though the morning was cloudy and the matter of but
                     little consequence, by Diaz, the second of the Cuban; Llulla, with his coat
                     buttoned up and his hat pulled well over his eyes, was placed with his back to
                     the river, and Mayer, who is complimented by all parties for his fine
                     appearance and courageous bearing, at twenty-five paces distant. The terms of
                     the cartel were thereupon explained to the principals—each to advance (if he
                     chose) and to fire at will.
                  The seconds having further intimated that the principals would be responsible
                     to them if either fired before the command, Diaz pronounced the words, "Are you
                     ready—fire."
                  For more than a minute after, neither party made any movement, but stood with
                     arms raised watching what the other would do.
                  At the expiration of that time, the Cuban, who had been standing in the
                     attitude prescribed by the code, made a step forward. As he did so, Pepe
                     Llulla's pistol was discharged. 
                        Meyer
                        Mayer
                      halted, made an attempt to raise his pistol, and rolling his eyes
                     like one who had received a mortal wound, fell heavily backward. The surgeons,
                     Drs. Ribot and Hava, who had been made to remain at some distance off, were now
                     summoned. The ball, upon examination, proved to have penetrated the breast upon
                     the right side, and to have come out at the back.
                  One of the seconds of Llulla, Mr. Wiltz, now advanced to the
                     side of the wounded man and proffered his assistance and a flask of brandy.
                     Mayer at first declined the latter—said that it was nothing—that he was an old
                     soldier, but was ultimately persuaded to swallow a draught upon the advice of
                     his surgeon.
                  The surgeon of Pepe Llulla, having been placed at the disposition of Mayer, the
                     latter, with his seconds, returned to the city.
                  Shortly after his arrival, a second challenge was tendered him and accepted,
                     and the second duel doubtless took place the day following.
                  At 12 o'clock on Monday it was announced by physicians in attendance, that the
                     wounds of Carlos de Mayer were not of a dangerous character, and that the
                     latter would be upon his feet in a couple of weeks. The ball is stated to have
                     penetrated from the nipple of the right breast to behind the shoulder.
                  Llulla was made to give $6000 bonds before Recorder Massicot that no more duels
                     should occur in this parish.
               
            
            
               
               UNDER THE YOKE.
               A novel under the above title was prepared for publication shortly after the war,
                  whose scenes, characters and incidents were drawn from the life of this city, and
                  which was intended to show the popular beliefs of those who sympathized with the
                  unpopular side, and what class succeeded in obtaining power in the unsettled
                  period which followed the war. What follows was intended to serve as a last
                  chapter:
               The reader is to suppose himself in the Crescent City, on one of those sultry
                  nights when people find it almost impossible to remain indoors, and those who
                  retire frequently get up and go out into court yards or in the streets in search
                  of a breath of fresh air.
               The date is after the war, and I have but recently arrived in this city. I met up
                  with Balthazar, an old army friend, who has returned to his ante-bellum habits. He was the sleekest of men before
                  the unpleasantness, and now more than ever affects an antique dandyism in his
                  dress. Having exchanged the salutations and eager inquiries usual among old
                  friends who meet for the first time after a long separation, we are promenading
                  the streets, and going over in our conversation the changes of the last decade.
                  Balthazar was a born gossip, with the talents of a Suetonius, and his tendency to
                  philosophize has increased with his superfluous flesh. He was the easiest going of
                  good natured men at first glance. At second, one thought he detected the faintest
                  possible shadow upon his careless face.
               "These confectioners' galleries," said he, as we passed beneath an open balcony,
                  adorned with plants and flowers, and lit up with gas—"these galleries are our only
                  places of resort and amusement in summer, and the drinking or eating of frozen
                  sherbets and creams the only occupation endurable. The streets are lit up with the
                  pale moonlight; but the garish gas lustres of the balcony are admissible as
                  revealing surrounding beauty. Thus situated, where you can see above or below
                  every well known face about town, either in company around you or promenading upon
                  the banquette below, life ceases to be a burden, even in this 'City of the
                  Sun.'"
               He led the way and I followed. "And now," he said, "tell me what you have been
                  doing since we parted at the break-up."
               "My adventures led me to the trans-Mississippi—to Mexico, to any and everywhere.
                  We must talk of something else while listening to the music of the "Belle Helene"
                  and "Africaine." But tell me, it must have been a rather melancholy feeling—the
                  return of the fragments of the old army to the city."
               "You are right—our friends hardly recognized us. In spite of telegraphic
                  dispatches announcing the end of the war, they had remained incredulous to the
                  last. The return of the disjecta membra by every
                  avenue of approach, alone convinced them of the fact."
               "You were doubtless regarded with some curiosity upon your arrival?"
               "The sympathy was absolutely painful—the cause did not go down without a sigh.
                  Women and children came to the doors and windows and gazed with such tearful,
                  pitying faces, that each one felt like returning to what had been his home by the
                  obscurest avenues of approach. The presentiments of many at the commencement of
                  the war had been realized; the flower and bloom of the South had been laid beneath
                  the sod, and the third of her bravest manhood would never return. With their rags
                  and tatters and the slender stock of baggage of those that did get back, they were
                  the representatives of the general desolation of the land for which they had
                  fought with such sublime devotion. They were impoverished and their home circles
                  were broken up. They had descended in the social scale, while those with less
                  conscience had accumulated wealth and honors."
               "With such a tremendous bouleversement of old
                  and new ideas, Balthazar, the wonder is not that the country should have remained
                  disturbed and unsettled, but that it should have quieted down as much as it
                  has."
               "The reason was," said Balthazar, "that they had already witnessed so many
                  hardships and changes, that they were but little affected by the subsequent
                  revolution—at the abrogation of former rights—at the transfer of power from the
                  white to the black population. Once having surrendered, they accepted in silence
                  the destiny of a people no longer able to struggle."
               "That, Balthazar," said I, "is the proper attitude of a brave and high minded
                  people—to struggle, once having determined to maintain a right—until you have no
                  further strength. Having reached that point the South did well to concede that the
                  cause she had contended for was lost, without further resistance. But instead of
                  moralizing, amuse me with the details of some of the characters we see around, and
                  who, doubtless, will contribute something at some day to the history of the city.
                  Who, for 
                     intance
                     instance
                  , are the four who are now promenading below upon the street?"
               "They are all men of the time. They might say in imitation of Voltaire, 'We are
                  all either thieves or statesmen.' The two first who walk arm in arm have both been
                  governors—one under the old and the other the new regime; they both showed much
                  more ability for gambling and horse-racing than for studying the happiness of a
                  people. The third of the party has been a governor too, for which of his talents
                  it is not precisely known; he was tolerably good as a reporter of prize fights
                  before his gubernatorial term; it is hardly known what talent he has since
                  developed since. His companion 
                     wsa
                     was
                   sent to the penitentiary in the State in which he was raised, but to the
                  U. S. Congress from this."
               "And the one who is dressed in the dandyish, ruffianly style?"
               "That is a former Coroner, who hired his jury for a pittance by the month, and
                  kept the fees allowed them by law for himself. In a celebrated steamboat disaster
                  which once occurred, and in which there were 175 dead bodies, our Coroner felt it
                  his duty to hold not one, but 175 inquests, and charged the twenty-five dollars allowed him by law for an inquest upon each
                  body. Figures like these tell. The conduct of the Coroner illustrates the policy
                  of the day."
               "And the next couple?"
               "A couple of officials, who, finding the fees of their office too small, have
                  contrived to increase them by selling the property taken from thieves, by selling
                  releases to parties sent to the Workhouse, by levying contributions upon bagnios
                  and gaming-houses, and by similar honest means."
               "After such an inventory of prosperous notabilities, it is hardly worth asking if
                  there are any honest men among the others."
               "Probably not. The rest are holders of petty offices who maintain their places
                  under all parties, and who steal from each with equal impartiality. The best known
                  of these is the one who wears whiskers like those that are strapped on to the face
                  of the heavy stage villain. He was the protege once of a bookseller, who was
                  appointed to a lucrative offices and who made him his confidential clerk, and
                  dying suddenly left him master of his affairs. The clerk was now taken into
                  partnership in the bookstore. The latter was insured for $10,000, and soon
                  afterward was burnt down. The $10,000 was now claimed and obtained from the
                  insurance office, and with this sum one would think there ought to have been some
                  assets to the firm. But no; the accounts were made to show that the deceased
                  bookseller was in debt to the clerk, and not the latter to the former. But what is
                  known as the 'Top-Rail' and 'Under Dog' parties affords a tolerable fair
                  classification of the community. The under dogs have become hacked, and are not
                  left a leg to stand on by the war, and will henceforth remain so; for you cannot
                  teach an old dog new tricks. The top-rail crowd have been upheaved by the recent
                  revolution. They embarked—when the excitement was all that way—as heavily as any
                  one for the defence of Dixie, but were not long, as Napoleon said about
                  Providence, in inclining to the side that had the strongest 
                     batallions
                     battalions
                  . Nearly all of the men of the time are made up of this class.
               "That distinguished legislator who is now passing, deserted at the right moment
                  from Mobile, and brought with him the plans of the city to the Federal fleet; that
                  United States Commissioner was formerly a Tombs lawyer, and subsequently an
                  auctioneer; under the carpet-bag dynasty he became a lawyer, and since his
                  accession to office has arrested almost every public officer in the State, from
                  Governors down to Mayors. The friend to whom he is talking is a commissioner, too.
                  He acquired considerable popularity by being to some extent Southern in his
                  prejudices and instincts, and by contenting himself in his acquisitions with as
                  little political display as possible. That rather good looking party who, with the
                  other two, is the celebrated inventor who discovered two or three guns and a
                  submarine machine for destroying all of the fleets in the world. What was still
                  better than these inventions, he succeeded in obtaining the appropriations for
                  carrying them out. He certainly is the luckiest of scelerats—he has never been
                  punished for forgery, arson, or poisoning, and succeeded once in getting oil when
                  the rope was actually around his neck—to arrive in this city and obtain the honors
                  that have ever since been awaiting him."
               "It must be confessed that the negro seems a poor judge of the honesty of the men
                  he places in office. But one must expect great changes 
                     it
                     in
                   every revolution."
               "Changes? You may well say changes. 'After the Deluge' has been with us literally
                  realized—the waters have already passed over us."
               "There were some eighteen hundred wealthy sugar planters in the State before the
                  war, as many raisers of cotton, and the various tax rolls of the city and parishes
                  would have shown perhaps as many more men of wealth. Where are they now? Seven
                  hundred have gone through the courts of bankruptcy in the last year. A good many
                  died broken hearted. A good many are subsisting in poverty upon estates that would
                  have once sold each for a million dollars, doubtful about food and shelter, liable
                  to be washed away by the now unrestrained river floods, and in constant danger of
                  being plundered by former slaves. It is hard to see that the entire wealth of a
                  parish is not equal to the value of a good crop of cotton for one year."
               "Canal street however, is still frequented by a well-dressed mob, and a swarm of
                  pretty women. But what were formerly the finest looking men in town have become
                  old and withered up. They appear to-day like so many Van Winkles. The men who, ten
                  years ago, were hid in Cimmerian darkness, have taken their places, and become the
                  central figures. Still the appearance of things is not altogether indicative of
                  melancholy.
               "There is much more philosophy in us than one would perhaps suppose, even in the
                  most impatient and passionate natures, over the ills of life. We would have danced
                  if we had returned conquerors; failing in this, but glad to return at all, we
                  dance just the same."
               "Judging from the number of bows you exchange with passers-by, you have not wasted
                  your time as to making acquaintances, Balthazar."
               "I have seen too many characters and have heard every principle so often defended
                  and disputed, that I am not at this day disposed to be exclusive," said my friend,
                  with a sigh. "One must bow to those who have been prosperous, and must not inquire
                  too closely by what pulling or what short-cuts they made their reputation or
                  fortune. I don't fling it up, for instance, to the judge, and the successful
                  advocate who are now passing that they were once upon the same side with us, and
                  had not become convinced of the error of their ways until the judicial ermine
                  awaited the desertion of the one and a fortune the other."
               In fact, so far from doing it, Balthazar lifted his hat.
               "I used to see," said Balthazar, sotto voce,
                  "the wife of our friend, the contractor, who has just passed, at the market,
                  carrying home her supplies in a brown paper parcel. I met her again this morning;
                  but this time she was attended by a servant with a basket of meats and vegetables,
                  and a red snapper flapped on top. Such is life. But I forgive him—the same I do
                  our friend over there, whose sugar crop used to be worth half a million, who would
                  place rouleaux of gold upon his mantel-piece for
                  his friends to draw from, but whose friendship now would not profit me a
                  cent."
               "Have you, then, no respect for the property-holders that sacrificed their
                  interest to their conscience—who gave up their worldly goods in preference to
                  taking an oath which they could not approve as men of honor. You may spare me the
                  list of battles and the inventory of our armies, if you will tell me of the weak
                  and defenceless who did that."
               "It is true," said my friend, "it was not unfrequently done—it is true that Butler
                  must have plundered this city in this way alone, to the extent of $10,000,000. But
                  what I am curious to know is how many never regretted the step; how many would
                  have acted in this way twice. I wish to know the precise effect produced upon the
                  South by the loss of a third of her best blood; a still larger proportion of her
                  wealth; the number of families that have disappeared from their former sphere; who
                  will be known no more and whose children will become vagabonds or worse through
                  misfortune."
               "The energy of the first generation will live in the second. Those families that
                  would have survived in any event, will devote themselves successfully to repulsive
                  labor. They will resign themselves without a murmur and without loss of honor to
                  undistinguished poverty. The terrible facts of the revolution and the destruction
                  of the whole framework of society will be a calamity, but one that may be
                  overcome."
               "No, mon ami. These revolutions have occurred
                  before, and it is the unscrupulous who prosper. The families that date back to the
                  Crusades date back to the lucky speculators who bought out the heroes who fought
                  in Palestine. The rich families to day of Paris are those who obtained the
                  patronage of the allied army after Waterloo, when other classes were ruined."
               "You were always more of a worldly philosopher than a patriotic soldier. You have
                  evidently forgotten altogether your old secession 
                     prejudidices
                     prejudices
                   and dislikes."
               "One must make polite concessions now—we admit now-a-days our neighbor's plan of
                  how not to do it was plausible. The only class I entertain any animosity against
                  are those who are fanatic and precise on one side, or irrepressible upon the
                  other; who will come into your pulpit and say you are not orthodox, or who in the
                  midst of a crowd when you can't take them aside and explain the matter privately,
                  will swear that you are too sleek and well fed."
               "In a place where politics and faiths are as much mixed up and twisted as they
                  have always been in this city, an obstinate orator of this description—"
               "Orators! you may well speak of their indiscreet oratory. They have never been out
                  themselves, but they cannot hear of your taking the oath. They have never struck a
                  blow, but will harrow you up in the crowds you most wish to conciliate, for your
                  weakness of spirit in wishing to remain in the country. For instance, I brought
                  together this morning four or five moneyed men, each one of a different stripe,
                  and had just asked them into Tom Carey's, to talk, over a friendly glass, of what
                  seemed a profitable scheme. Just as we had ranged ourselves against the counter,
                  and were beginning to talk at our ease, in steps a seedy figure who stalks across
                  the room with the fixity of gaze of a Banquo. His eye appeared so
                  motionless that I hoped that he had not seen us. But just as we were about to
                  'come to a carry' he shook hands with such fervor with the whole party that we had
                  to ask him to unite. The result justified my dread. Once in the party he became
                  the sneaker of the occasion. He called up to mind those agitated times when the
                  devil himself could not tell which way the cat was going to jump, and when you
                  were compelled to take a course which each saw was not the right one. There was at
                  first a faint cough and some hemming and hawing; but my party soon became
                  interested, and instead of agreeing to the proposed project, began discussing
                  whether this flag or that flag had been rightly dragged in the mire, or whether
                  the 'firm treatment' of Unionists or rebels had been exactly the thing. In short,
                  my whole scheme bursted up in a row, and it was as much as I could do to keep my
                  men apart."
               "And about these carpet-baggers, whose names I hear in everybody's mouth?"
               "The carpet-bagger is a man who came here in a brown linen coat, with dyed
                  moustaches, paper collar and self-adjusting cravat. A stove-pipe hat is considered
                  a sign of prosperity, much affected by the class who were sutlers and
                  camp-followers during the war, and the carpet-bag with which he is invested by
                  tradition may or may not contain a superfluous or clean shirt; the one in which
                  they appear in public is very apt to be dirty. So much for the personnel of the
                  tribe. It must be confessed that in the art of dressing they are a long way behind
                  their quadroon allies."
               "Doubtless the carpet-bag will in time be adopted as the standard of these
                  leaders, in the same way that the apron of the Persian blacksmith was set with all
                  manner of precious stones, and became the sacred ensign of state. But to return to
                  your gossip. Is the party who is sitting near us one of them?"
               "He is the Colossus of their number—the Magnus Apollo of the cotton thieves. Since
                  the war his operations have been conducted with such scope and depth—such audacity
                  of conception, and such nerve in execution, that it is impossible not to
                  admire."
               "But in what way did he obtain his bad pre-eminence?"
               "Our hero was possessed in the first place of $100,000. With this sum actually in
                  his breeches pocket, he did not have much trouble in borrowing as much more. He
                  now repaired to this city. Once here, he dispatched letters home, stating that
                  $200,000 was no money. In order to accomplish anything, he would have to be
                  sufficiently provided with the sinews of war to control the market. Upon the
                  strength of these representations the funds were doubled. Continuing on upon this
                  tack as long as remittances were to be obtained, he next wrote back that the
                  cotton and sugar had been purchased; that they should be shipped from Galveston,
                  Mobile or Vicksburg—this port or that—and that he had drawn for such and such
                  amounts. Not to make a tedious explanation, he drew altogether for the sum of
                  $2,000,000. The suit which is against him now is for the destruction of the last
                  steamer that went down. Having had the ill-fated steamer insured for its full
                  value, he is now charged with causing and procuring the total destruction of the
                  vessel. But people, however, who are worth two millions of debts are seldom
                  convicted, even by the most rigorous of juries."
               "And the party who sits opposite?"
               "The $2,000,000 speculator and debtor to society is the scelerat who appears at dinner parties in faultless linen, and who
                  astonishes you at the Opera, or evening assemblies by the purity, not so much of
                  his morals, as of his linen or gloves. The one of whom you now ask is an
                  adventurer of a different class.
               "Though young, he has already appeared prominently before the public by every road
                  and avenue of rascality. He has embodied in himself the knavery and trickery of an
                  entire generation. He is in this respect unlike most men, who are able to do
                  justice to only one vice. He aspires to run through the whole gamut of
                  rascality—through its flats and sharps—its appogiatura and falsetto notes.
               "He has in his day been under arrest so many times, and before the correctional
                  tribunal, that clerks have become wearied with the examination of charges and
                  printers of putting his name in type.
               "He concedes himself that he was the offspring of one of the most notorious
                  brothel mistresses of the town by, as he says, a certain prominent politician, but
                  the probabilities of paternity were much stronger in favor of a bandy-legged
                  gambling house runner, who enjoyed a still larger share of his mother's confidence
                  and favor. Commencing life by setting up nine pins in a bowling alley, he rose
                  rapidly to the rank of a rinser of glasses in the barroom to which he was attached. His industrial career met with a
                  chock here; the opening of a money-drawer upon one occasion was so much
                  misconstrued by his employer as to lead to our hero's incarceration in the House
                  of Refuge. This event, which would have put a quietus upon the hopes of another,
                  was the making of his fortune. He there acquired a smattering of learning, and
                  what to him was of still more service, learned to lie, steal and pick pockets
                  along with the best.
               "Such talents were not destined to remain long hid. A winter of tolerable success,
                  after his escape, enabled him to make a rather fine display in the way of 
                     dresss
                     dress
                  ; and his morals and habits improved with his wardrobe. After being a spy
                  and runner for a good many dubious enterpriser, he succeeded in marrying a
                  prosperous Magdalen who had retired from keeping an assignation house. From her he
                  learned the names of those sinners who are not yet irretrievably damned. By
                  skillfully using this knowledge he did not have much trouble in borrowing sums of
                  money to keep their names from the public.
               "His wife at length, failing to assist him with any further advances—the golden
                  hen was one day killed for its egg. The remaining fortune of the miserable woman
                  was divided between the husband and the party who had assisted in sending her to a
                  better world.
               "The war found him in the penitentiary; but having obtained his release after the
                  arrival in the State of Butler, along with other convicts, the talents he had
                  hitherto employed in individual robberies he now extended upon a larger scale in a
                  general plunder of the public. Before it was well known who he was, he had given
                  the most undoubted proofs of his ardent patriotism—he had taken all manner of
                  oaths; he had become loyal. He became a member of the Convention—he received
                  lucrative appointments. He was greatly admired at one time for the ready tact and
                  knowledge of the world which enabled him to so easily grasp at success; and
                  knowledge of a certain kind he really possessed. However, it was of that class for
                  whose entertainment his wife had been wont; to act as hostess, find it was in
                  introducing commanding officials to this fallen sisterhood that he had shown his
                  greatest worldly tact."
               While this conversation was progressing, a third party had taken his seat very
                  near our table and seemed, from his manner, to be paying the profoundest attention
                  to our conversation. His presence partly suggested my next answer:
               "You need not tell me any more to-night, Balthazar. Suffer me to believe until
                  to-morrow that there are a few honest people left in the world."
               We rose to leave.
               At that moment Balthazar was touched upon the shoulder. In answer to a look of
                  inquiry, the stranger pointed to a crescent badge which he wore concealed upon his
                  breast, and when showed that he was a detective of the city police.
               "You are under arrest," said the latter, "and the warrant is in my pocket, if you
                  wish me to expose it here."
               The face of Balthazar became overspread with a sickly pallor, but he only shrugged
                  his shoulders.
               "You are too well known to escape and there is no need of my company. If you will
                  take my advice you will walk directly from here to the stationhouse."
               The suggestion seemed quietly acquiesced in. I was about following him.
               Balthazar himself made a gesture to intimate that he did not wish company.
               As he disappeared through the door I was so much astonished at his taciturnity, at
                  the suddenness with which the whole affair had happened, that I could scarcely
                  inquire what had transpired.
               "If I understood you," said the officer emptying the glass that Balthazar had
                  ordered, but had left untouched, "you have but just arrived, and do not know much
                  of the recent history of your friend."
               "I know that he was at soldier, a patriot, who fought through four years of
                  carnage."
               "Four years of carnage—that was a very long time ago. Your friend is one of that
                  kind of whom he himself spoke, who could not make their beliefs square with their
                  actions twice."
               "What! you wish to tell me that—"
               "I am telling you that your friend, good patriot that he was, has taken one oath
                  (to obtain certain offices and emoluments) that he was sorry in the first place
                  that he ever took any part in the rebellion, and another oath swearing, that he
                  had nothing whatever to do with the Confederate cause. He abuses the carpet-bag
                  dynasty, but the fact is he is one of the ring himself. He complains only because
                  he does not get his full share of the plunder."
               "I shall not believe you—it is impossible that such a man"——
               "It is nevertheless true. He has received a great deal of notarial practice—has
                  had the control of important suits and estates, and has been received as security
                  on bonds, and all that, simply because he was in the ring. If the arrest of
                  to-night had not been made, (and it was made to ruin him) he would have been
                  appointed upon the Police Board, and would perhaps have become one of the managers
                  of the $700,000 of the plunder to be derived from one of the last legislative
                  bills."
               "And what is the charge against him now?"
               "There are a dozen charges, and he will never get over them—one, for instance, of
                  defrauding the U. S. Government by withdrawing whisky from the Customhouse, under
                  pretence of sending it to a foreign port, (which thus escapes a heavy tax,) and of
                  sending off in its stead so many barrels of water. He was in the ring, too, which
                  brought in the $450,000 worth of sugar, which has just been seized. There are
                  other charges of extortion, breach of trust and embezzlement, which he might
                  easily wear out or stave off, by postponements and continuances in court, and
                  procuring the absences of witnesses—even if the allegations are all true. But the
                  misfortune, beyond all remedy, is that he has been abandoned by his ring—that is,
                  he is now left out in the cold by all parties, and is as politically dead as if he
                  had been left on the field of battle."
               The detective having helped himself to a cigar, and half emptied a caraffe of
                  brandy of its contents without stopping in his discourse, left me, with the remark
                  that one must get ahead in life, and to do so now-a-days it was necessary to make
                  some shorter cuts and more abrupt turns than an honest conscience would always
                  allow. "And," said he, as he looked back, going down stairs and puffed behind a
                  volume of smoke, "so long as the role of an honest man is played out, and rogues
                  are too lucky or are considered too highminded ever to be hung or shot, I don't
                  see any particular reason for being needlessly honest myself."
               It was the last time I ever saw Balthazar. A paragraph in the daily journals soon
                  after told of the death of a man by suicide, who had been remarkable during his
                  lifetime for his neatness and elegance in dress, and who, previous to taking
                  poison, had arranged himself for his own funeral.
               The body was nearly consumed by decomposition when discovered, but there was no
                  trouble in identifying it as that of Balthazar.
            
            
               SHORT STORIES.
               
                  I—Under the Gaslight.
                  A certain one of the silent shadows, nameless in this narrative, but known to
                     every one who has had occasion to study crime in this city, as a detective in
                     years past, deserves much more notice than an ungenerous public has thus far
                     given him. He is spoken of by the title of Captain among his friends, and has
                     about him very much of a military air. His figure is stiff and erect, his skin
                     is the color of scorched parchment, and has the appearance of being tightly
                     drawn over his jaws. You are not surprised at hearing that he is considered to
                     have the strongest wrist of any fencer in the city, and is regarded a dangerous
                     too to encounter, in one way or the other.
                  In this way the Captain is as much a character as Hugo's Detective Javers. He
                     knows all varieties of turbulent spirits from the days of the watchinangoes, (as policemen were once here called) vigilance committee, and
                     know-nothing riots, down to those of a more modern day. He is so familiar with
                     the city that he could tell the street he was upon, or the hour of the day or
                     night, by the raising of the vehicles the day of the week by the crowd upon the
                     street, or to what place of amusement promenaders intended visiting from their
                     dress and manner. He can tell what particular meeting its being hold in a
                     public building from the faint gleam of light unobserved by all else but him,
                     and in the same way that in Arab estimates distance by the color or the taste
                     of the soil, so this cold but profound observer forms his opinion of men and
                     things from minute signs in a large city.
                  Old sensation-seekers look upon the Captain as a treasure, and want no better
                     guide through dark labyrinths and doubtful situations. If a duel, prize fight
                     or execution were to come off to-morrow—if the body of a suicide or of a
                     murderer's victim was to be visited, the old stager would pick out the Captain
                     as the best possible company to examine into the matter in hand.
                  It was not long since when the Captain had been acting as our cicerone in a
                     remote suburb of the city that he proposed in returning that the cab should
                     drive a little out of the dirse route homewards. As the
                     Captain has some touch of sentiment and philosophy, and his conversation,
                     whether of successful politicians and wire-workers, or of successful thieves
                     and blackguards, is always amusing, no objection was made to the diversion.
                  The gas-lighter was just about completing his rounds, the shades of evening
                     were deepening into thick shadows, when the driver turned down into the rear
                     portion of the Second District. At one moment we were passing the coffeehouse,
                     in front of which a highly respectable lady was accidentally killed. At another
                     we paused in front of one of the obscure cabarets, whose black-whiskered keeper
                     would speak a jargon of all languages; in still another locality visited the
                     guests would be found engaged in playing dominoes, keno or baccharat, or
                     amusing themselves in drinking majorca or absynthe.
                  Some times, after such visits, the cab would proceed upon its way without
                     stopping, as if everything was understood by instinct; some times the Captain
                     would alight and exchange a few words with the cabaretier or some of his
                     guests. Their answers, however, appeared all unsatisfactory, and threw no light
                     on the movements of the party for whom the Captain was evidently seeking.
                  The driver was now ordered to try Gallatin, Barracks and Old Levee streets. A
                     glance was given at Ourgate Alley—a still more careful and scrutinizing visit
                     was made to the shoemaker's New Amsterdam, Stockholm, Green Tree, and similar
                     coffeehouses. Nothing there but rivermen, sailors, and their male and female
                     plunderers. A bald-headed musician was playing a piano in one—three or four
                     fiddlers occupied a dais in another—principally, as it appeared, for the
                     especial amusement of a visitor who was executing a lively break-down upon a
                     table. In another place visitors and guests appeared to suffer from a general
                     seizure of clothing, and in a state of awful nudity, were dancing with the
                     frenzy of so many bacchantes.
                  The letter scene was irredeemably shocking to even the hardened nerves or our
                     guide, who appeared willing enough to get away without reckoning his chances of
                     being robbed or having his throat cut.
                  "There will be three or four complaints made to-morrow of pocketbooks having
                     been stolen, of garroting, slungshotting, or perhaps of murder, but it's not my
                     place to interfere—the party is not here that I want."
                  "And that queer-looking restaurant in Burgundy?" 
                  "That was the one owned by the notorious Laura Fry, recently dead. She closed
                     instead of commencing her career by getting married, and in less than twelve
                     hours the man whom she honored with her hand had been a lover, husband,
                     widower, legatee, and had closed the day by sleeping in a cell of the lockup.
                     The man's name was Salvador Fortunes, and the woman whose history is thus
                     singularly mixed up with his, was once a well known courtesan. The fact that
                     the woman died suddenly, and exhibited in her death agonies some of the
                     symptoms of poisoning, besides being dreadfully bloated and swollen after
                     death, led to the supposition that a terrible crime had been committed, and to
                     Salvador's incarceration.
                  The deceased, after going through the usual career incident to a woman of her
                     avocation, established a restaurant upon Burgundy street during the last years
                     of the war, and owing to the large number of soldiers then in the city, soon
                     begin to accumulate dollars by the thousand. The houses in fact attracted the
                     disreputable of both sexes until 4 o'clock in the morning Laura would
                     superintend her restaurant having her sofa 
                        coveyed
                        conveyed
                      to the kitchen when worn out with fatigue.
                  After the war when business become dull, she went to Monterey, but subsequently
                     returned to the city, possessed still, as supposed, of seven or eight thousand
                     dollars. She again went into the restaurant business, and adopted first one lover and then another, and being made
                     to suffer more or less by each and all of them. In one case she was induced to
                     make some sort of written instrument by which the control of her property was
                     transferred to a fast friend, and the natural result soon followed that she was
                     shut out of house and home. The affair ended by a law suit.
                  Her last attachment was to Salvador, and his account of the matter was that not
                     liking to be living with a woman to whom he was not married, he had all along
                     determined to invoke the blessing of the church, and had only been prevented by
                     one unavoidable circumstance and another. At the time the death took place, the
                     wedding dress had been ordered, and the ceremony was to have been performed as
                     soon as it was finished.
                  One night the attached couple agreed to pay a visit to the French Market on the
                     following morning, and at the time appointed prepared an early breakfast.
                     Shortly after Laura commenced complaining of pains, and vomited up a black
                     looking fluid. A cup of coffee and a lemonade, administered by Salvador,
                     produced no happier effect. Salvador now applied to a physician, but lost some
                     time in finding one who would consent to act without a certainty of being
                     paid.
                  On the day after, the wedding ceremony was performed, although the deceased
                     must have known that she was upon the point of death. She furthermore made a
                     will, in which she declared her last friend (as the custom nearly always is)
                     her legatee. She died in the afternoon. Upon calling upon a doctor for a
                     certificate of natural death, those who appeared declined giving it, in view of
                     the swollen appearance of the body, and perhaps other attendant
                     circumstances.
                  Salvador meanwhile had been arrested to await the result of a post mortem
                     examination upon the body by the Coroner, and was carried to his cell indulging
                     in lamentations upon the singularity and severity of his fate.
                  The investigation, however, showed that the death was the result of disease and
                     of the life Laura had always led. Its whole effect was to convince Salvador
                     that a wedding day may be the most miserable in life, and that one sometimes
                     gets worst punished for doing the most creditable actions.
                  "But you spoke just now Captain of wanting a certain party; what is the nature
                     of your search?"
                  "It is the disposition made of a number of valuable diamonds recently, and the
                     discovery of the party who robbed them from their owner. There is no need of
                     telling you that half of the most curious information never finds its way in
                     print, and that such publication would probably cost the informant his life
                     that furnished it."
                  Meanwhile the cab had been driving toward the back portion of town—toward that
                     portion which is only visited after dark, or under the gaslight—through
                     Customhouse, Basin, Conti, Marais and Treme streets.
                  "The financial troubles of the city have affected this class as well as every
                     other," said our guide. "There has been a day when five thousand people might
                     have been encountered at midnight in this portion of the city, occupied in
                     gambling, carousing, sight-seeing, or dissipation in one form or another. Upon
                     these remote thoroughfares, during the war, when the army was here, any
                     quantity of soldiers and army officials were to be encountered. That was the
                     golden day for the bagnios, coffeehouses and restaurants of this portion of the
                     city, of high and low degree. More than one fortune was quickly won, (from
                     lovers of the unsophisticated class,) or thrown away upon those who were only
                     too worldly-wise or unscrupulous. Nearly all of the diamonds that are worn, and
                     a good many of the silks that are flaunted, date back to that remote day."
                  "It appears to cost something for the better class of these votaries of
                     pleasure to live?"
                  "Probably. The landladies argue that as their satellites can easily relieve a
                     well-fledged and infatuated victim from the country of three or four hundred
                     dollars, that it is but fair they should have their share of the profit. Hence,
                     they exact at least $30 a week for board, and other expenses amount to at least
                     as much more. Besides, the butterflies generally die in debt, and require
                     coffins, and the diamond rings hardly ever keep long enough to pay for
                     these."
                  The detective alighted at the door of a house of noble proportions, of a dark
                     red hue, and whose aristocratic tint doubtless served as a fitting prelude to
                     the architectural glories within. So at least hinted the plated glass door,
                     lined with delicate curtains, and the marble steps that led thereto.
                  In answer to the summons which the Captain made at the door he was ushered in,
                     as could be seen from the cab, through a passage way adorned with a couple of
                     statues representing some obscure divinities of light, and in whose hands were
                     held lighted flambeaux. Beyond this lay the drawing-room, peopled with a few
                     figures in glittering attire, and who, from their costume and manners, might
                     have been visitants from the Mountains of the Moon. Neither did the decorations
                     of the rooms in the pictures that hung from the walls, the plated mirrors, the
                     delicately tinted furniture, appear to be altogether of a sublunar character,
                     though evidently intended to embody a sybarite's dream-luxury and repose.
                  The grotesque and bizarre aspect of everything—splendor without comfort;
                     glitter and sparkle, suggestive of death and despair, in the background—gave
                     rise to singular reflections. However, the questions asked after the Captain
                     returned, were sufficiently guarded and discreet.
                  "This palace looks too magnificent to be precisely a private residence. Or, if
                     it is one, it is such as a grateful nation ought to give to her ablest son, to
                     her bravest General, her most virtuous statesman or best reporter. Is it
                     possible that a distinguished General or banker really resides here?"
                  "No—they only come here as visitors. The house you are in is, in point 
                        of of
                        of
                      fact, the most magnificent of the maisons
                        d'amour. In the same way that the Mississippi contributes the mud
                     deposits of a dozen different States, in the same way does the visitor
                     contribute toward the cost of the building. However, residents of the city,
                     perhaps, too, pay their shore. In good times the mistress in her old
                     establishment could set aside $2000 weekly toward paying for the expenses of
                     the new building."
                  At this moment a visitor was discovered through the now open door, descending
                     the stairs, pursued, as he descended, by the curses and objurgations of an
                     angry woman over the banisters.
                  "The building appears to be none the richer from his visit," said the
                     detective, explanatorily. "This young man, nevertheless, has a respectable and
                     high-spirited mother, who would rather see him in his grave, or furnish him
                     money by taking in washing, than that he should thus sully her name."
                  Shortly after the report of a pistol was heard, coming from a remote portion of
                     the building.
                  "That, I take it," said the guide, "is my man—the party whom I have been
                     looking for at the various places we have visited. His style of doing business
                     is to terrify visitors of limited nerves by a display of firearms—sometimes
                     times affectedly, sometimes in earnest. In such cases one party or the other
                     has to leave."
                  The conjecture proved to be correct. There was a noise heard once more at the
                     head of the stairs. It appeared, however, that the unsophisticated visitor, so
                     far from being timid, had had the best of the affray, and had succeeded in
                     throwing the aggressor over the banisters.
                  The party who thus unexpectedly reached the lower floor was elaborately dressed
                     with a white cravat and a plentiful display of shirt-bosom—one of those figures
                     that might be frequently encountered at the Opera or on the corner of Canal on
                     a bright day.
                  The detective whispered a word in his ear:
                  "
                        Yon
                        You
                      are wanted and are looked after. You had better go to headquarters
                     and report."
                  The well dressed visitant from the upper floor turned deathly pale. It was
                     obvious that all thoughts of his sudden descent had been forgotten.
                  "Am I under arrest?" he asked.
                  "You can go by yourself—the next hour will do," and the interview was ended. We
                     had left the house, and were once more in the street.
                  "The party we have just met," said the guide, "is one of three others who
                     recently went into a jewelry store as country merchants. While the storekeeper
                     was occupied in selling three pretended countrymen a silver watch, the fourth,
                     by way of a distraction, filled his pockets from one of the trays of diamonds.
                     As this party ran into the street when discovered, and the other three
                     remained, the unfortunate jeweler was awkwardly situated for running after him.
                     The thief is found, it is true, now, but justice is not sufficiently lynx-eyed
                     to bring him to punishment in this country. The jeweler will probably be glad
                     to get a portion of his money back, and dismiss the prosecution. Or even
                     supposing that he should convict his man, and send him to the State
                     penitentiary, he would escape from there, as is being done almost every day
                     without trouble. Still, even here, burglars get picked up sooner or later. Do
                     you remember Watson, who robbed $40,000 of jewelry? He escaped from our
                     penitentiary and went back to England. Unluckier there than here, he did not
                     remain a month before he was sent to Botany Bay."
                  "But to return to the house you have just entered. What is the moral you derive
                     from your twenty years of experience?"
                  "The moral is that it requires as much talent to succeed as a thief or a pimp
                     as it does as an honest man—that to go slow by the old fashioned roads of
                     honesty is the best policy, and that for the woman whose cheek once forgets to
                     blush at the mention of dishonor there is really but little difference between
                     rustling in diamonds and silks and dying in a dance house."
               
               
                  II—Adventures of a Girl of the Period.
                  Certain characters come in course of time to figuring so often in police
                     records, and reporters are so often annoyed with having to write their names,
                     or with having, at the prayers and entreaties of respectable friends, to
                     scratch out and erase them, that they become almost part of the history of the
                     time. The crucified thieves, Delilahs, Lais and Phyrnes, descend to posterity
                     along with the good, and, in fact, the names of the latter are much oftener
                     forgotten.
                  What is proposed now to be done is to make up a full history of the adventures
                     of one such character as is already published in detailed reports.
                  In 1855, a young girl, named Annie ———, with rosy complexion, slender form and
                     intense black eyes, figured in the Fourth District, in the neighborhood of the
                     Magazine Market.
                  The thousand attractions of a city were so great as to keep Annie much oftener
                     in the streets than at home. The cause of charity at fairs received nearly
                     always the support of her presence; and if the books she read were not of the
                     highest order of merit from their contents, they were generally attractive at
                     least from their title-pages and bindings. It was the misfortune of Annie to be
                     unduly influenced by title-pages and covers, not only in her books, but her
                     acquaintances, and calf was the binding that most appealed to her
                     easily-dazzled fancy.
                  Her adventures commenced by getting married; but becoming disgusted with the
                     modest household which she had been given by her husband, she one day sold the
                     furniture, and returned home with the yield from the transaction in her pocket.
                     Next she met with a clerk in an up-town store, with whose fascinating manners
                     she was so charmed that she attempted—the husband about this time dying—to pass
                     herself off as a romantic girl. The object of her admiration she generally
                     spoke of and wrote to as "Dear Gus," and one night she made him go to church
                     with the family, in the best suit of clothes that Dear Gus could obtain on
                     credit. She attempted the same experiment a second time, and the couple
                     actually did start off at night to listen to an eloquent sermon; but Gus, who
                     was a man of no principle, had nearly yawned the top of his head off on his
                     previous visit, and was only moderately pleased at the prospect of the second.
                     Gus, before they had gone half way expressed his contempt for her romance and
                     devotion, and, stopping her in the middle of the street, demanded if she took
                     him for an egregious simpleton?
                  They went off together, but it was toward a restaurant and not the church they
                     set out. Her friends did not know much about Annie after that, and a short
                     letter which she wrote dated from another city will be sufficiently long, in
                     spite of bad spelling to draw a moral:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Dear Gus—Havana is the meanest place I've ever seen,
                                 and I've had the blews so bad I feel ready to quit living. But I
                                 take the liberty of hoping you are not enjoying the same complaint.
                                 It's hard to write to one, for a ten months' love, when your
                                 happiness is plaid out. Some may call this love. I don't. So good
                                 buy, Dear Gus, and no more, from
                              
                                 ANNIE"
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  The farewell proved (with an exception soon to be named) eternal, as farewells
                     must, where the farewelled party is an unprincipled "Dear Gus," and so thought
                     the latter himself when he saw that the letter was dated from Eugene's Hotel,
                     No. 64 Seniente Rey, near Plaza del Christovill.
                  It was not until a couple of years after that that Annie again returned to the
                     city. Meanwhile she had met up with, in Havana, one of those adventuresses so
                     dreaded by hotel keepers, dry goods merchants, and, in fact, by every class
                     from whom anything is to be made, and Annie, with her still rosy cheeks and
                     fresh looking and infantile face, was palmed off as an heiress, the daughter of
                     an American Governor or Senator, who had sought the mild zephyrs of the gulf to
                     restore her health.
                  The hotel-keeper of the San Isabel, becoming, at length, fatigued with the size
                     of a bill which swelled to $200 in a month, and the jewelers, bouquetieres,
                     livery stables and modistes, growing too impatient at the extravagant tastes of
                     the two, our heroine's health recovered sufficiently to return.
                  A couple of years after, (for affairs did not prosper here,) the scene fitted
                     to the interior of a sub-urban church in the neighborhood of the Hotel Dieu.
                     The sacred edifice was thrown open for the performance of a nuptial ceremony,
                     and a gorgeously gotten up bride and
                     groom had brought together an interested, not to say an excited, crowd as
                     witnesses.
                  The parties to this marriage were, first, a young lady who was then said to
                     come of rich but respectable parents in some remote State, though in reality
                     our old friend Annie ———; and, secondly, a hack driver of such ebon hue that
                     charcoal would make a white mark upon his face.
                  The bride, who was still good looking, had been since her arrival from Havana
                     under the protection of a friend.
                  It was at this period that an accident occurred with her old friend, (now Capt.
                     D.,) which had better be described before going on with the wedding. "Dear Gus"
                     had fought a duel since last heard from, and killed a young man of position and
                     character. He had gone to the war with one of the roughest companies sent from
                     this city, and had come back with only an indifferent reputation.
                  The Captain, at the end of the unpleasantness finding himself without friends
                     or resources obtained the situation of a supernumerary upon the police. One
                     night, while upon duty, he had seen Annie pass richly dressed and her hands
                     glittering with diamonds. The flash of these gems suggested an idea to the
                     Captain. The next morning, proceeding before the Recorder, he proceeded to put
                     it in execution.
                  Having called to the attention of Recorder Gastinel the fact that he had once
                     made, while on a furlough from the army, a speech upon a public occasion from
                     the same platform with him, he then begged that a certain party should be
                     released from the Workhouse, promising that, if the request was granted, the
                     Workhouse party should leave. The Recorder thereupon granted the request.
                  The Captain then proceeded to the Workhouse and obtained the release of his
                     friend. His next move (it was dark by this time) was to obtain two police
                     uniforms, one for himself, the other for his friend, and dressed in these, and
                     with an overcoat worn on top, to proceed to Annie's residence.
                  Arrived there, Capt. Gus, whose face was now shadowed with whiskers and
                     otherwise unrecognizable, knocked and succeeded in gaining entrance. The
                     terrified inmate was then in dishabille, but
                     the fact did not prevent the Captain from entering, and demanding to search the
                     premises.
                  This demand he proceeded to put into execution, tumbling clothes from the
                     armoir and even going so far as to wrest the rings from Annie's hand. She
                     protested in vain that he had no right to make the search, and protested that
                     he "ought to have a little piece of paper" if he really was warranted by
                     law.
                  Giving way at length to loud outcries, the real police were brought to the
                     scene. The Captain was arrested and confined in one cell, and Annie in another.
                     Making subsequently some complaint about her money being stolen from her, the
                     clothing she had on was removed from her, in order to discover whether or not
                     the money was concealed about her person.
                  This arrest and the complaints she made led to two or three subsequent arrests,
                     without much satisfaction ever being obtained. The diamonds, too, were gone.
                     Let us now return to the actual wedding, and how it came about. 
                  The party under whose protection Annie was then remaining had frequently sent
                     her out to ride with no other attendant than the ebony hack-driver, whom we
                     left standing at her side at the altar.
                  In what manner this Othello pleaded his suit, whether he told of his 
                        hair-breath
                        hair-breadth
                      'scapes, of being run into by dray drivers or arrested by police
                     offices, or whether Desdemona loved him for the dangers he had passed, in
                     getting clear of both drivers and police officers, are doubts which no
                     Shakespeare is yet able to solve. At any rate, the parties determined upon
                     marriage in spite of the protestations of her friends in general and the curses
                     of her friends in particular.
                  In spite of tempting offers to increase her allowance by the cher ami, to the altar she went, and in a wedding
                     dress as costly as her finances would admit, the golden filet was placed upon
                     her finger.
                  Desdemona, the result soon showed, sacrificed everything to her attachment for
                     Othello, and when the latter removed his now blushing bride from the
                     aristocratic looking mansion in which she had lately resided, it was to carry
                     her to the unpretending cottage of his own. The marriage didn't result as
                     happily as might have been expected from one founded solely on love. Othello's
                     occupation, in the first place, was gone, that is to say, he was no longer
                     willing to do anything—not so much as to curry his horses or even himself.
                  It need hardly be said that love in the cottage soon ended, and that another
                     change came 
                        sver
                        over
                      her history.
                  
                  Some of those establishments upon our principal streets, and which are intended
                     for purchasers of the opposite sex, are certainly worth glancing at more than
                     once, even if you do not wear bonnets or crinoline, or adorn your head with
                     back hair and waterfalls. One of these we have in our mind's eye will serve as
                     a sample. The name of the proprietress inscribed in golden letters upon its
                     stone front. The windows of the boutique are
                     adorned with plate glass of the largest pattern, and bowered and garlanded with
                     ribbons. One is permitted to admire the delicate Valenciennes, Pointe
                        d'Alencon, and other ornaments of the beau sexe,
                     including a wax doll, who, like many others that are living, seems dressed not
                     in the latest fashion, but what soon will be. Delicate lace curtains hide the
                     interior of this female bazaar from the rude gaze of the outside world, and
                     except with a companion of the other sex, one meets in entering a somewhat
                     constrained welcome. Not much opportunity is afforded him to chaffer about the
                     price of the gay tinted articles that lie scattered around, and any vacillation
                     in purchasing would probably insure his immediate ejection. If you happen to be
                     a clerk and do not feel too aggrieved, one might almost be amused at the
                     different treatment a gentleman receives when in a store kept by a lady, and
                     what the latter expects when she in turn becomes a purchaser. Think of a clerk
                     who should decline allowing a lady to turn over every pattern in his store, and
                     insist that she should instantly trade or travel. And yet man is such a
                     submissive animal that he never dreams of complaining.
                  It was in such an establishment as this that Annie next looms up. She was
                     employed here as a seamstress of the lowest order, and her wages were $21 a
                     month. In returning to hard work she had been seized with a momentary gleam of
                     hope of settling down to a virtuous life. Unfortunately she had become, by this
                     time, addicted to liquor. Unfortunately too she had taken part in the elopement
                     of one of those delicate young shop-keepers, (with a hair dresser) who are
                     brought out to this city from France. Annie was discharged, and the night
                     following she was arrested for being drunk and disorderly.
                  She was sent to the Workhouse to keep company with the numbers of others who
                     wear the coarse garb of blue, and it was soon difficult to remember that she
                     had ever known a more generous erous nature—that she had ever belonged to any
                     respectable class of humanity. She by no means stood alone. Dozens of other
                     parties who had a once held prominent position as head clerks, men of business,
                     officers in the recent war, etc., have had to travel in that stage coach of
                     vagabondage, the Black Maria.
                  It was while there that Annie wrote in a delicate hand from the Asylum of
                     Pariahs the following note:
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 CITY WORKHOUSE, —— 1863.
                                 To the Hon. Recorder Gastinel:
                              
                              
                                 Dear Sir—I was committed by you on the 10th on the
                                 charge of drunkenness for the term of thirty days.
                              If your honor will be kind enough to remember, you promised me that
                                 if I would get a few lines from Sister Frances, in the Charity
                                 Hospital, to the effect that I had recently been under her care;
                                 that you would release me.
                              Your honor, I have written a letter stating the case, and sent it
                                 by George Bernard, the Black Maria driver of the First District. He
                                 went twice since yesterday morning, but unfortunately was not
                                 successful in seeing her, as I suppose she is busy in the chapel.
                                 But, your honor, my suspense is so great I could not wait longer,
                                 but, relying on your kindness and generosity, I implore you to
                                 grant my release either this evening or to-morrow, and I hope you
                                 will not refuse me when you learn that I am more fit to be the
                                 inmate of a hospital than a prison. If 
                                    yon
                                    you
                                  should kindly liberate me, I will stay with Sister
                                 Frances until I am well. If I come before your honor again, give me
                                 six months without release.
                              Hoping I have not written in vain, I am yours, respectfully,
                              
                                 ANNIE ———.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  The request was granted by the Recorder but did no good. Annie ——— was sent to
                     the hospital in the Street Commissioner's wagon, but in so weak a condition
                     that she appeared to be dead before she arrived these. The driver thereupon
                     carried her to the old building used to contain coffins for paupers, and placed
                     her inside of one of these. It was in fact within this narrow prison-house in
                     which she had been prematurely placed, that she breathed her last. Her remains
                     were carried to Pepe Llulla's Cemetery, and some of the bricks which had been
                     taken from the old Orleans Theatre, after it burned down, were used for the
                     "oven" in which she was buried.
                  One would have thought that the complications which had attached at every stage
                     to this woman's life would have stopped here. Nothing of the sort. The last
                     paramour with whom Annie had lived was an old broker, who had commenced life by
                     being a police officer. He had a claim, during the war, against a widow
                     possessed of a house and some means, and who abandoned it to go into the
                     Confederacy during the stormy period. When she returned she found her house and
                     furniture seized and her children stripped of everything, although no citation
                     or summons had been made. The whole matter, after long litigation was finally
                     disposed of adversely to the claims of the widow and executory process issued.
                     But in whose name? Not that of the broker, against whom judgments were also
                     pending, and who did not feel it safe to sue in his own name. The name that he
                     now happened to think of was that of Annie. So that it happened that a cast off
                     mistress was accidentally remembered after her death. A month after she was
                     mouldering in her coffin, a forged document bearing her name was used to
                     deprive a poor widow of the only roof left to shelter her; and singular as it
                     may seem, when the forging was actually proven in court, the suit was allowed
                     to stand decided in his favor.
               
               
                  III.—Life Upon the Half-Shell.
                  Any one who has witnessed many disturbances, must have remarked that between
                     certain men, or certain classes of men, there is a sort of instinctive
                     opposition or antipathy. Something which leads them to quarrel or disagree
                     whenever or wherever they meet—whether for the first or the last time.
                  It was apropos of this remark that such a meeting occurred not a great many
                     nights ago, at a late hour, and we wish to tell from hearsay one of the amusing
                     accounts given of it. The scene was in an out of the way saloon, on one of the
                     back streets. The exact locality of the cabaret was bespoken by a lurid lamp,
                     inscribed with the simple motto of "Oysters."
                  In this saloon, and ranged along the counter, two men, each armed with a silver
                     pronged fork, were standing, and from obvious difference in appearance and
                     character, stood in grotesque contrast, each eating the oysters that were
                     placed before him, and each alternately waited upon by the same oyster opener.
                     This arrangement was obviously watched with the closest jealousy by both
                     parties, and judging from the grim and saturnine look with which the oyster
                     eating proceeded the occupation was suggestive much more of a duel than of a
                     friendly meal.
                  However, before the counter had been lined with a great many shells the
                     features of one of the two men, the one who in physique and strength would have
                     made a magnificent drayman or blacksmith, began to relax; he opened his jaws in
                     a calmly meditative, (not to say drunken,) manner, and closed and worked them
                     with slow, ruminative movement. The world was his oyster, and in his actual
                     mood he would have then consumed a dozen worlds, or a dozen oysters, with the
                     same philosophical indifference.
                  The features of his antagonist, and who would have been taken for a blaze,
                     well-fed man of society, never meanwhile changed: he emptied his oyster shells
                     with the air of one belonging to the silver-fork school, and the shells, when
                     emptied, were cautiously and precisely placed upon the counter with the air of
                     method and business with which a veteran gamester handles his betting checks.
                     The oyster duel or contest between the two rivals proceeded at first without
                     further incident than the calling for Maunsel White, birds-eye peppers and
                     other condiments.
                  At the opening, however, of the sixth bivalve, a discussion arose, through some
                     inattention or carelessness, as to who was entitled to the smallest, and who
                     the largest, of the delicacies in question. Both now commenced applying
                     epithets, with the air of men who had drank too much to be discreet, and were
                     yet not quarrelsome enough to fight outright. The strong man was called
                     "Beast," by his better dressed rival: while the latter was denounced as a
                     bloated blow-hard, who only managed to keep agoing and afloat by his cheek and
                     airs.
                  "My family, sir," said the better dressed of the two men, throwing himself, as
                     if glad of a chance, in the attitude of a speaker, "have been identified with
                     the prosperity of this city. When the city was great from its agriculture and
                     commerce, my family was great-its commission houses, with its name, controlled
                     the products and capital of the State. There was never any administration in
                     which my name has not contributed able men to fill offices of honor and
                     trust!"
                  "Looker here, mister—I know you; you are an old office holder that's what you
                     are, and all you are. You keep yourself from going to the workhouse by blowing.
                     Some of your name and stock ought to have been known as public men; they have always got all of the offices
                     there was to get, and divided them up, when they could, among their family and
                     friends. You have froze on to everything there was to freeze to; and that's
                     about all you have done."
                  "It is not worth while talking to a d—d rough about what he can't understand,"
                     resumed the first speaker, with a drunken air of grandeur, and at the same time
                     throwing himself into an oratorical position. "Why, sir," said he, driving his
                     fork through an oyster and brandishing it in the air, "why sir, our history
                     dates from the time when another portion of the city was the great business
                     centre—the history of my name would illustrate the decline and fall of the
                     prosperity of the city. Why, sir, the men to whom I have the honor to claim
                     relation, made Crescentia the entrepot for the commerce of the West, filled her
                     with tropical products, developed her cotton and sugar culture, controlled her
                     Western shipments, and as factors represented the thoughts, feelings and
                     prejudices of the class who gave the State her wealth."
                  "That does not prevent you from being a d—d old slow coach and dead beat now,
                     who don't understood how to get ahead by new ideas and crosscuts? You are only
                     fit to keep things at a standstill, where they were twenty years ago."
                  "New ideas? You are a hog who has no ideas whatever—no reverence or sentiment
                     for age. Bah! Give me some whisky, barkeeper; he is not worth the fine speech I
                     made, and which he can't comprehend."
                  "Give him a drink that will poison him—something that will work off the whole
                     of his loud-mouthed, swindling, stealing, office-holding stock, and I will pay
                     for the liquor, barkeeper. At the same time a glass for me, too. I want to
                     drink to him with that toast."
                  The glasses were placed before them in silence, and the liquor poured out and
                     emptied down with similar running compliments. A glass or water was placed on
                     the counter, and before a second one could be filled, the first was claimed by
                     both characters.
                  The rougher looking of the men got hold of it first, but it was snatched from
                     his hand by his better dressed rival, who intimated, by putting his hand to his
                     side, that he was prepared to hold possession. A hand-to-hand struggle
                     followed. There was a couple or so of shots fired, and the rougher speaker had
                     his shirt collar and bosom torn open until it was made to resemble an
                     exaggerated Byronic model, and the whole affair ended by his rival's being
                     knocked down with the tumbler.
                  "You may think, barkeeper," said the upright combatant, "that I ought to pay
                     for that tumbler, but I shall do nothing of the sort. It's your fault in not
                     having honest visitors and keeping an orderly house, that the tumbler was
                     broke. And as for that infernal cuss on the floor there—here come
                     alone—you."
                  He caught his prostrate and weak-kneed foe by the collar, and both disappeared
                     through the door. 
                  "A'n't they the d—dest rummiest pair that ever you see?" inquired the
                     bar-keeper, when they were gone.
                  "Who are they?" was the immediate inquiry.
                  "The heaviest of the two is a contractor of some sort, and the other helps him
                     with his influence in getting contracts through. They are brothers-in-law,
                     though they never seem to agree about anything except the contracts, and are
                     always flying at each other that way. Whichever gets the best of it carries the
                     other home. Goodnight," said the barkeeper, as he put up the shutters and
                     pushed the whole party out of doors, "there are a heap of queer characters, and
                     the queerest in the world are those who agree so well about some things and
                     disagree about others."
               
               
                  IV—Hymenial.
                  It is not an unpleasant affair to attend the marriages of young couples—to see
                     bridal veils and orange blossoms—to hear the "Heaven bless yous!" and the other
                     polite phrases with which a good natured world starts the youthful pair on
                     their way, and, as it were, pats them on their back.
                  Of the marriage of which we are now to speak, the reader must suppose that
                     those fine expressions of friends have been for some time forgotten. Several
                     months have rolled by, and we are deep into the honeymoon. The marriage thus
                     far has been a happy one. There is a handsome revenue. There is a residence in
                     the fashionable part of town. It is not difficult to be happy on such
                     terms.
                  The only point of disagreement between the pair is the strong friendship the
                     husband has for a bachelor friend. It may be because the young man has
                     melancholy drooping moustaches with spiked points, or it may be because he has
                     weak eyes. Or it may be because Madam imagines that the young man with weak
                     eyes misleads her husband, occupies too much of his time, or that the pointed
                     moustaches points for him the downward path. At any rate, she can't abide the
                     weak-eyed guest.
                  The young man lives, when at home, up or down the coast, and does not remain in
                     town many days at a time. But hitherto, when he came to the city, it was sheer
                     nonsense to talk of his going to hotel. The friendship of the husband would
                     brook no denial. A bed and a place at the table were always at his disposal. 
                  Thus matters stood up to the last visit. On that occasion the young man from
                     the country parish was met as usual at the boat. But instead of being escorted
                     to the residence he was shown the way to a rather gloomy counting-room. A door
                     leading to the rear opened into a dark, empty-looking, cob-webbed apartment
                     still more sombre.
                  The soul of the weak-eyed young man began to be alive to some misgivings. He
                     thought he detected a sinister tone in the conversation of his friend which all
                     of his efforts failed to conceal. What still farther confirmed these misgivings
                     and caused his moustaches to be more than ever drooping, was the sight of a
                     pistol barrel.
                  There was no mistake about the matter. The muzzle was actually pointed at his
                     breast. The husband held in one hand a sealed package, which had the appearance
                     of containing several closely written sheets.
                  "Deny at the peril of your life. Did you write this?"
                  "But—"
                  "Yes, or no?"
                  The weak-eyed young man was struck down with horror. He answered "yes."
                  "She has confessed all," continued the husband, "she was detected with flowers
                     from you for which she could not account. Unless you imitate her example—"
                  A dramatic emphasis with the muzzle of the pistol completed the rest of the
                     sentence. The friend remained silent. He had lost the use of his senses.
                  "On but one condition," proceeded the husband, "can you live, and that is by
                     signing a written acknowledgment that you are the author of this package."
                  The unfortunate heard and remembered, but without comprehending, except that to
                     deny something was death, and to sign the writing might be death in another
                     way, too.
                  The husband now withdrew to the counting-room, followed by the friend. A number
                     of clerks were present. One of them, without any trace of violence, was ordered
                     to produce writing material. It was done.
                  "When?" said the husband.
                  "Never—at least, various times," stammered the weak-eyed friend.
                  The question and answer were written down, and served as the prelude to similar
                     interrogatories and answers.
                  Just as the weak-eyed young man was signing it, the wife in question entered.
                     The weak-eyed young man lost more than ever the control of his senses.
                  "Madam," said the husband, "you arrive in time; you will make an excellent
                     witness. He has confessed all. He is guilty."
                  "No doubt of it—I am glad you think so. I never liked him."
                  "He is a traitor to friendship."
                  "Aha, you see now that I am always right. Did I not warn ——"
                  "This is no time for jesting. That man, madam, has confessed that this package
                     which a messenger has informed me was evidently intended for your eye ——"
                  "Well, what about this package—what does it contain?"
                  "Do you wish to deny that it contains the damning evidence of his guilt?"
                  "Have you read the letter?"
                  "No, there is no need—"
                  A loud peal of laughter from the wife followed the remark.
                  "Well," said she. "you are a simpleton. I tried to make you a little jealous of
                     this precious friend of yours, but, this is carrying matters rather far. But
                     read—let's see what the letter contains."
                  The package was hastily broken open, and what appeared at first blush to be a
                     string of two hundred verses became manifest. There was absolutely nothing
                     else.
                  "I see it all now," said the host with an immensely relieved air, suffering the
                     manuscript to fall like lead. "The egregious ass instead of writing
                     love-letters, has only been making rhymes, and I wouldn't read one of them for
                     love of money, if they were all addressed to my wife. Friend," said he,
                     addressing the weak-eyed young man, with the spiked moustaches, "it is about
                     time for us to part. You had better break yourself of the offence of writing
                     dull verses, and whether you continue to sin in this way or not, do not, when
                     you are again tried, confess to a crime which neither you or the lady ever
                     committed."
               
               
                  V.—Story of a Crevasse.
                  During the spring season of 1869, the most striking and captivating of the fair
                     visitors to the city was a young lady frequently seen at the Varieties Theatre,
                     the Opera House and the ice cream saloons of Canal street, and who, during a
                     well known fair, had charge of one of the most prominent punch bowls in the
                     hall. The belle in question was remarked for her fascinating manners, her
                     low-necked, coquettish dress, and, in particular, for her well-groomed and
                     carefully arranged tresses. Her manners excited admiration in the breasts of
                     all, and no other feeling besides, than that of envy that two of her admirers
                     were allowed almost to monopolize her time.
                  The chances of the young candidates for the favor were so near evenly divided
                     that bets were freely made at the clubs as to the success of both parties. The
                     day at length arrived when the wedding ceremony was to have been performed at
                     the family resilience of the lady, and it was then announced that a gentleman
                     whom we shall speak of as D——, was to be the happy bridegroom.
                  His rival still spoke confidently of his hopes of winning in the envied
                     quarter, although his prospects did not appear very encouraging considering
                     that the day and another bridegroom had actually been named. The fact upon
                     which he based his expectations was that the lady had repeatedly assured him
                     that she loved him and him only, and had again and again asserted that the
                     ceremony, in spite of the entreaties and preparations of her family, would
                     never take place.
                  So much having been given, it now remains to state what actually occurred on
                     the night of the wedding. The account which follows rests upon the details
                     given by the lady's friends, and perhaps in some places, as will be guessed,
                     upon the letters of the lady.
                  The bride, according to this account, appears to have believed to the last,
                     that the ceremony would be postponed by the direct interposition of her family,
                     She was at that time in the country, seventy-five miles from the city and the
                     rival, with whom she was really in love, had, though invited yet failed to
                     arrive at the family mansion.
                  A thousand times in the last day she determined by positive announcement to
                     break off the marriage, but was overruled by her friends. She is said to have
                     once thrown herself at her mother's feet and begged without effect that the
                     marriage might at least be postponed.
                  The ceremony was fixed for an early hour on Thursday evening, and the time at
                     length arrived. The bride had previously become desperate, and had shut herself
                     up in her chamber. She had even refused to dress herself in the bridal robes
                     purchased for the occasion, and resolved to appear in the presence of the
                     minister only to state her objections to the ceremony in the most solemn
                     manner.
                  Upon being led to the parlor her agitation became so great that restoratives
                     had to be employed. Her subsequent statement was that she was scarcely
                     conscious of what she was doing when she stood before the minister.
                  The bans were now read for the last time—the attendant witnesses had been
                     appealed to to show cause, if any, why the ceremony should not take place—the
                     bridegroom had responded, and it only remained for the bride to do the same
                     thing.
                  It was precisely at this moment that the remarkable facts occurred that would
                     seem almost incredible if they had not been already published in the papers.
                     Just as the bride was called upon to make a response, the appaling fact was
                     announced that the river had broken its banks. It was at one of those points
                     where the current presses with its whole force against a hastily constructed
                     levee, and before the tremendous force of the great river, almost the whole of
                     the newly built mound was swept suddenly away.
                  In a moment, the house was filled with consternation. The guests were hurrying
                     away, the bride was fainting, and the bridegroom was endeavoring to induce the
                     minister to hasten the few words that remained to complete the ceremony.
                  It was at this juncture that the rival, who had thus far been left in the cold,
                     made his appearance, and the now fainting bride was carried by him from the
                     scene of danger. Once having her in his possession, both parties felt that no
                     time was to be lost in preventing a recurrence of the same matrimonial danger.
                     The result of this reflection was, that a neighboring minister of another
                     denomination was called into service, and the marriage ceremony actually gone
                     through with the second time in one night. One would, naturally, suppose that
                     the chapter of accidents had ended. On the contrary, however, it was at this
                     point that the romance of the affair commences. The ceremony, which had been
                     interrupted in the first instance, by the crevasse, was interrupted in the second by the appearance
                     of the lady's friends, and, in spite of all outcries from the bridegroom of the
                     second contract, the bride was carried away.
                  The friends and witnesses of the first bridegroom contended that the first
                     wedding ceremony had been complied with in all of its forms. The lady, upon the
                     other hand, protested that her faculties were, at the time, too paralysed with
                     fear to be capable of giving consent and that the second ceremony, and the
                     second only, was the only one that had for her any meaning.
                  As the matter stood at last accounts, neither husband appears able to gain
                     possession of the bride, and it is not improbable that the double marriage will
                     be brought before the spiritual or legal lights for settlement.
               
               
                  VI—The End of an Old Suit.
                  The well known case of Armabide was recently up for a hearing with every
                     prospect (as all know now) that Armabide's heirs would recover a very
                     considerable estate.
                  "Call the next witness, Mr. Sheriff," said the Judge, from his cushioned
                     tribunal. The moment after the loud voice of the Deputy Sheriff was heard three
                     times calling upon Joviana Armabide to come into court.
                  The witness has been called, and while the Judge is waiting beneath his crimson
                     canopy, the counsel are studying the next points that will arise, and the
                     reporters are cursing the necessity of having to be present at all—some one at
                     their ear is whispering a gossiping history of the case, and explaining why
                     Joviana Armabide will never answer the summons. Let us listen to this story
                     until the report of the Deputy Sheriff to the court is heard.
                  This is an old case (says the speaker) in which Armabide, who had made a
                     fortune in the coffeehouse business was the principal. Joviana was his
                     daughter, and a very pretty daughter she was. Her first appearance in public
                     was in connection with a theft of valuable diamond years ago. Joviana, at that
                     time, had been staying for a day or two in the house of the lady who had
                     sustained the loss, and the strong circumstances against Joviana were
                     substantiated by her own confession in court.
                  When brought before the Recorder, she admitted, as well as could be understood
                     through her sobs and tears, the theft of the jewelry, but absolutely refused to
                     tell what had subsequently become of them. She was at the time so sensitive,
                     young and fresh, and looked so naive and charming, that the harsh myrmidons of
                     the law were left in doubt whether she had used the diamonds as playthings for
                     her doll, or had committed the theft at the solicitation of a lover. One
                     supposition was as probable as the other.
                  But to return to her father, old Armabide. He made his money by hard licks, by
                     working behind his counter for forty years, and was sometimes assisted by
                     Joviana, who was lively and intelligent, and who doubtless had as many friends
                     and patrons as the father. At any rate the old man managed to acquire two or
                     three good renting buildings in Exchange Alley and several houses of still more
                     value on Old Levee street.
                  Old Armabide was living along easy enough, upon his income, some three or four
                     years ago, and spent his time with friends of similar tastes and habits in
                     playing dominoes, smoking, and in absynthe drinking at one of the coffeehouses
                     that still passed under his name. The truth was that every day he seemed to
                     become more and more fond of each of these amusements, particularly that of
                     absynthe drinking.
                  Joviana had grown into a woman by this time with a good many capricious tastes
                     of her own. The diamond business, by the way, had never been satisfactorily
                     explained, or what party had proved to be the beneficiary. The case had shown
                     that her principles were not very strong, and her affections were not much
                     stronger. She did not like in particular, naturally enough, the way old
                     Armabide was spending his money with his friends.
                  One night, while under the influence of liquor, the old man gave his name as
                     security, or put it in jeopardy in some way, to the whole extent of his
                     fortune. Shortly after, the principal failed.
                  Armabide's property being now liable to attachment, he first pleaded in court
                     that his signature was obtained by fraud. He next transferred his whole estate
                     to his daughter. Thirdly, he more than ever played dominoes and caroused with
                     young friends.
                  Joviana had outgrown the days when she sometimes stood behind the counter. She
                     was now the legal possessor of the estate; was now old enough to get married.
                     She wanted the money converted into solid cash. What furthermore excited
                     attention, the lover, who bad been spoken of in connection with the diamond
                     larceny, now openly appeared upon the scene. Joviana was obviously completely
                     under his influence.
                  One night Joviana's father started from home with a large sum of money in an
                     old leather pocket-book, and after frequent potations engaged about midnight in
                     drinking hot whisky punches, and rolling with all his might at the rows of pine
                     in a bowling alley. Becoming heated at this exercise, and reanimated to renewed
                     exertions by the applause of a number of rough-looking spectators, he took off
                     his coat containing his money. He hardly knew himself how he was conveyed home
                     except that it was in a carriage of some sort. It hardly need be stated that
                     before he arrived there the money was missing; the pocket-book contained $2000
                     in greenbacks.
                  Joviana had been dreaming of marriage and of purchasing a bridal trousseau with
                     this money. She now remembered a similar accident, a few nights before, where
                     the old man had been carried to a disreputable bagnio, and where, after being
                     robbed of everything that he had, he was conveyed to the station by a police
                     officer. The consequence was that she now claimed the estate which Armabide, as
                     has been shown, made over to her by legal instrument. Upon his making
                     opposition, a petition was entered by her before one of the District Courts to
                     have him enjoined, upon the ground that he was unable to manage his
                     affairs.
                  To this management of the estate the old man refused to submit, and
                     particularly, to yielding up certain valuable deeds, which Joviana seemed
                     particularly anxious to obtain, and upon which, in some mysterious way, seemed
                     to depend her marriage settlement.
                  Finding all other means failed, and determined to get possession at all
                     hazards, she spent so far as to have her father arrested, under a warrant, for 
                        tresspass
                        trespass
                     . The imprisonment lasted for only a few hours. Nevertheless, it
                     showed Armabide that he had not only dispossessed himself of all power, but
                     that his daughter and only living relative had become so hopelessly infatuated
                     with some one else, that she had sinned against the most sacred of ties.
                  That night, (for, as has been stated, his imprisonment lasted only for a day,)
                     upon recovering his liberty, old Armabide repaired to the accustomed cabaret,
                     and amused himself mechanically at his game of dominoes, protesting at the time
                     that his heart was broken. When he left his friends he retired to one of the
                     old three-story buildings which he had once called his own. What he did
                     afterwards was never known, except from conjecture. His dead body was found the
                     following day, bloated and swollen, in one of the remotest rooms of the old
                     unfurnished house, and left but little doubt that the old man came to his death
                     from poison, administered by his own hand.
                  Though Joviana's friends were very much divided as to the amount of guilt for
                     which she was responsible under the circumstances, such a death must have been
                     a dreadful shock to a young girl, whether innocent or guilty, with any
                     pretension to feeling. It afflicted her, however, in more ways than one. The
                     old man's estate was now discovered to be of an unsubstantial, visionary
                     character, totally eaten up with debt, in case his lawsuit was not gained. That
                     was the first discovery. The next fact that was discovered was that 
                        Jovina
                        Joviana
                     , deserted by the man that had promised to marry her, in the same way
                     that she herself had betrayed her father, was in every sense a ruined
                     woman.
                  Thus betrayed by her friends, and abandoned by Heaven and men, the poor girl
                     appears not to have made one single struggle. She lived alone, no one, not even
                     the administrator of the estate, knew how or cared to inquire—in one of the old
                     outhouses or shanties which appeared to have remained to her until the day of
                     her death.
                  To return now to the summons of the Deputy Sheriff. It was to appear and answer
                     in the old and now successful suits brought by her father that her name was now
                     called in court, and it was while the Deputy Sheriff was exercising his
                     stentorian lungs, that the above story was told. But the only answer, however,
                     to the crier's voice, was the notes of a tolling bell and the passing of a
                     funeral cortege.
                  Joviana had been summoned already by higher messengers, and had passed into the
                     presence of the dread tribunal from which there is no appeal.
               
               
                  VII—The Ring of Berbrices.
                  We have friend whom we shall call Asmodeus, who meets with surpassing
                     adventures. He is never either any better pleased than in relating them—where
                     he finds a listener. He candidly admits that he has met with extraordinary
                     success—that he is a man de bonnes fortunes,
                     that is as dangerous as the hero who was pointed out to be shunned by watchful
                     mammal to their daughters and who depopulated the streets upon which he lived
                     through the jealousy of husbands.
                  It was a night or two ago, at the opera, concert or show of some kind, that
                     some one addressed an inquiry to Asmodeus, between the acts, in reference to an
                     individual who sat near:
                  "Who," said the querist, "is the gentleman who is dressed like a minister, but
                     who looks like a prize fighter recently in training?"
                  "That is the father," said Asmodeus, who saw his opportunity, and who made a
                     movement of his hand to his heart—"the father of the etherial creature just
                     beyond, whose head is bound with the brass band and the blue and white fillets.
                     She its the belle of belles, and would have slain, doubtless, her lovers by the
                     score had her father not moderated their ardor much more by his friendship than
                     she has done by her cruelty."
                  "But in what way? He certainly looks good natured—apparently the last man that
                     would banish his friends from his house."
                  "That is precisely it. On the contrary—he is devoted to his friends, and no one
                     is fonder of company. But he has the misfortune to learn boxing in the course
                     of his travels in his youth.
                  "He has never outgrown his fondness for the art. A young man, for instance,
                     would come to visit his daughter. His cruel hospitality would make him suppose
                     the visit intended for himself. He would force the bashful youth to drinking
                     more than he was accustomed to in the first place, and in the second, to trying
                     on the muffles or boxing gloves, before being able to obtain a sight of the
                     daughter. For a timid and weak-kneed young man in such a case, there was no
                     more chance than for a blind dog in a meat house.
                  "I became infatuated once myself, but was as much surprised as the guests of
                     Amicus were at being compelled to engage in such an encounter. But unluckier
                     than Pollux, this King of Berbrices had it all his own way. He knocked me about
                     pitilessly without moving out of his tracks; first in one way and then in
                     another—against the wall, over the piano stool and rocking chair, and once in
                     the lap of beauty herself. If the last fall had not awakened other ideas I
                     should have brass-knuckled her papa if it had been the last official act of my
                     life."
                  "And as it was?"
                  "As it was, he left me where I had fell. The thought of eloping at once with
                     the daughter, and of escaping the danger of being murdered myself, or of
                     committing the crime, suggested a nobler ambition. The daughter would readily
                     have consented; for though, as I have stated, she had dead loads of suitors,
                     they stood off at a respectful distance, smiling and timid, like a dog whose
                     ears you have pinched or tail mashed, looking wistful and willing, but afraid
                     again to come too near."
                  "And the elopement?"
                  "We would have eloped to a dead certainty, had it not been for a slight
                     accident. My inamorata at times visited at the house of the family with whom I
                     had been staying, and, upon the evening in question, instead of being at home
                     to profit by her company, I had been enticed to a soiree where the mistress of
                     the house was as cruel as the aforementioned papa; that is she was a very
                     effective dancer, and she made me dance with her, under pretence of amusing me,
                     almost every waltz or galop. It was after midnight when I reached home, my
                     night-key had been left in my room, and my head swimming from the effects of
                     the dancing and of petroleum champagne. I was locked out.
                  "However, my room was upon the gallery, and the appearance of a colored waiter
                     whom I knew and who happened at the moment to be passing, suggested the idea of
                     making him climb to the gallery above, obtaining the key from my room
                     mantelpiece, and of throwing it down. No sooner was the idea formed than it was
                     executed. In the twinkling of a bedpost he was in the room—not that I had
                     pointed out—but the one next to it.
                  "In a moment more he had struck a light, and a feminine voice which, I now too
                     well recognized, was heard screaming out 'Who's there, murder, watch, help,'
                     and the thousand agonized cries that women only too well know how to make. The
                     truth of the matter was that she had been prevented by the inundation of the
                     street from returning home, had been assigned this room and just before
                     retiring had been reading of the Kersteiner outrage on the Gentilly Road. At
                     sight of my messenger she put the worst possible construction upon his
                     presence, and the shrieks had been the consequence.
                  "The blundering Mercury meanwhile had dropped his light, and came a tearing
                     down a balcony post like a lizard, head foremost. I would have hurried him away
                     and said nothing of the matter. Unfortunately a policeman who had been awakened ten squares off—had come up—my
                     messenger made his escape—but so did not I, and the affair got abroad.
                  "I attempted, when I could, to explain the affair. It was no use. She did not
                     believe my story in the first place, and her only answer was that a man who
                     would send a negro blundering ahead in that way was a natural born fool—was
                     absolutely crazy, and did not deserve——."
                  The rising of the curtain cut short the rest of the narrative.
               
               
                  VIII—Sunday.
                  The day found a good many worn down and exasperated to the last degree by the
                     storm. A good many determined to celebrate the day as one of rest, by lying
                     abed, and only stepping out doors to get shaved, attend church, read journals,
                     saunter a little through the principal streets, and merely to drop in and
                     apologize for not attending the lunches or convivial assemblages to which they
                     had been invited.
                  Unfortunately one meets on Sundays fifty acquaintances to whom it is absolutely
                     necessary to speak. You receive, besides a dozen new introductions. These
                     acquaintances, as likely as not, care nothing for the strict laws of
                     temperance, and become brutal when you tell them you were raised by temperate
                     parents, and that you are yet to taste your first drop of liquor. In short,
                     instead of modest lunches, you receive a dozen polite but firm invitations to
                     drink firewater, and to some of these you are, perhaps, cowardly enough to
                     yield.
                  If your evil genius has betrayed you into such a party, as likely as not you
                     will have no other occupation than to visit most of the prominent coffeehouses,
                     and institute comparisons between the various vegetable and fermented juices.
                     Your partly will at first commence wandering about from coffeehouse to
                     coffeehouse in a purposeless sort of way; skipping about here and there, but as
                     the hour advances, and  nonchalant promenade or saunter to assume
                     more and more of a zigzag tendency, each saloon is taken into its regular
                     order.
                  One such crowd on the Sunday in question became amusing. It consisted of a
                     prosperous party, who had been lucky in his speculations, and who was good
                     natured enough to assume the role of host. Its two other striking component
                     parts were a slim young man of a complimentary turn and of a dismal tone of
                     voice, and, secondly, a good journeyman drinker, with a red face and a tendency
                     to view things in an awkward or unfavorable light.
                  The drinking stage of the proceedings was at length temporarily ended by an
                     invitation to dinner, which admitted of still less refusal than an invitation
                     to drink, and with some sepulchral protestations about felicity on the part of
                     the slim young man, and about dinner parties being a bore from the red faced
                     gentleman, the invitation was accepted.
                  Thereupon the party passed behind one of those rosewood or 
                        mahogny
                        mahogany
                      doors whose handle was silver and whose glass-lights were lined with
                     delicately marked lace.
                  A decanter and glasses once inside, presented by this time a familiar
                     appearance to the company, and these and the cigar case having been decided
                     upon, the aspirations of the party took the direction of high art.
                  The parlor was hung with pictures, and they wandered around from one frame to
                     another, pointing out with their canes one merit here and another there, or
                     laying down, with a flourish of lighted cigars, various imaginary canons of
                     art—about one in particular, which seemed a favorite with the host. The slim,
                     complimentary young man, though his tone of voice was somewhat too guttural,
                     could discover more merits than anyone else, while the red-faced gentleman who
                     contradicted him point for point, was the only one who could discover any
                     defects. In the tone of the ghost addressing Hamlet, the picture was spoken of
                     as the slow growth of years, and something muttered in too low a tone to be
                     heard about light and shade—mezzo-tints, chiaro-obscuro, effects, etc. The
                     red-faced gentleman, however, took a realistic view of what everybody else was
                     ready to pronounce an oil painting, and it was nothing but a d—d thread and
                     needle picture, which every girl that went to a fancy school, knew how to make,
                     and knew nothing else.
                  Before the red-faced gentleman could finish his explanation, he was introduced
                     to the lady of the house as the author of the picture in question, and, as a
                     suitable punishment, requested to lead her in to dinner. What followed at table
                     none of the party have since been able to remember more than vaguely, but there
                     was no doubt about its being an awkward meal. The hostess was angry, the guests
                     thick-tongued, and, besides these drawbacks, the embarrassed host had to keep
                     the dismal young man and the red-faced gentleman from perpetually locking
                     horns. For instance, when the Amphitrion attempted to joke with the lady about
                     bringing home unexpectedly so many guests, the red-faced gentleman would insist
                     that "You are too rough with her, squire; go easy. You can't make women
                     understand a joke." While the slim young man would break forth in a sepulchral
                     voice with some poetical quotation on the virtues of the opposite sex.
                  The feast ended without the host having to turn his party out of doors, but it
                     is not likely that the next church service was deprived of its patrons, or that
                     the matron of the house was imposed upon at the next return of Sunday.
               
               
                  IX.—A Story about a Procession.
                  It sometimes happens that a reporter, without pretending to enjoy the
                     confidence of the beau sex, or to have much
                     time to waste in combing out tangled locks for their benefit, hear,
                     nevertheless, an occasional morceau of gossip from this quarter. He may, for
                     instance, be traveling in the city car, be seated too near at the hotel table,
                     or perhaps waiting under a beauty-laden balcony for a procession. However he
                     may have heard it, whether in one of these ways, or by washing off the guilty
                     ink stains and making himself look smart, he is willing to make affidavit that
                     the following story was heard; furthermore that it was heard from one of the
                     prettiest pullets that ever wore white ivory comb in raven tresses, or that
                     ever echoed the walnut-shaped heels of her bottines upon Canal street. The last
                     fact it is necessary to state, in order to understand what follows:
                  "A couple of months ago there came to the house, at which I was staying, a
                     young girl from up the coast who awaited the arrival of her father or mother to
                     return home, and who meanwhile declined seeing any of the outside world. To
                     this there was one exception. Her parents did not write to her, or send her any
                     money necessary to defray her expenses direct, but through the hands of a
                     confidential agent. It was, therefore, necessary that she should see him in
                     order to receive remittances, other letters and other information from
                     home.
                  "Of course it soon transpired that the young lady was desperately in love with
                     the young man; and some time after that, instead of intending to return home,
                     she had in reality but just run away.
                  "About the time that this discovery was made, the girl learned that the young
                     man was already engaged, and that so far as marrying him was concerned, she
                     might just as well have remained at home. The young man, in fact, went off and
                     got married, and, what was worse, left her, lamenting, with no money and no
                     resources.
                  "She was in a bad way by this time, and we were a little afraid she would
                     commit suicide. To keep from actual want she began to dispose of some jewelry,
                     and begged me upon one occasion to assist her in pawning a bracelet. I had
                     never done anything of the sort before, but I felt very sorry for the poor girl
                     and I was goose enough to determine for once to try.
                  "The first place I went to was to a pawnbroker's upon St. Charles street, to
                     whom I showed the bracelet in question. His answer when I asked him what he
                     would give me for it, led me to think that brokers were the politest of men.
                     After some words, he said it was not possible such a pretty woman as I could
                     find any need for display of jewelry; that he would advance me $100 without the
                     need of exacting any pledge. I knew it was not worth that much, and I asked him
                     again to name a precise sum that he would give for the jewel, for I knew that
                     he was jesting when he offered so much. As he still repeated his answer, and I
                     saw by this time what his meaning was, I was obliged to be contented with
                     giving him a look, and left the office in a little less hopeful spirit than
                     when I entered. However, I ultimately disposed of it for half what he offered
                     to me.
                  "When I went back home and gave the girl the money, she seemed to recover
                     courage at the sight. I had brought back with me a bouquet, and she now asked
                     me what I was going to do. I told her that there would be a procession of one
                     of the clubs, and that I intended throwing my bouquet to a friend. The thought
                     struck her as a bright idea. 'I mean to have one, too,' she said, and
                     immediately ordered off the servant girl to get the finest one she could find.
                     The bouquet was found, and the procession soon after came marching on with
                     music, banners and a thousand lamps.
                  I flung mine to a party who had nothing whatever to do with this story, and
                     watched with some curiosity what my friend would do with hers. She held it by a
                     string in suspense, while at least five hundred men passed by, and made each
                     one believe that he would become the lucky possessor. However, she finally
                     singled out a young man in the —— Guards, who pleased her fancy, and dropped it
                     into his hands. The young man looked pleased enough, of course, the procession
                     passed on, and in a short time after we had both forgotten all about the
                     matter.
                  "It was not, however, the case with him. He contrived to get introduced to the
                     house and to this girl, and after such a commencement it did not take very long
                     for either party to make up their mind. They soon fell head over ears in love,
                     of course, and, doubtless, (for she left us soon after) the blessing of the
                     church has by this time riveted and clinched their vows."
               
               
                  X.—Amphitrion.
                  An acquaintance of ours is a gourmet of some
                     reputation. He can talk about dinners from the time of Heliogabalus to Baron
                     Brise. He loves to bring good feeders together, as did Mr. Blimber, with his
                     friends in Dombey and Son. These he has several times "hospitably entreated" at
                     what was supposed in advance to be at his expense. Some accident or fatality
                     would cause it to be at their own. We recount an instance or so, to put the
                     public on their guard:
                  Once he excited a hungry crowd of half a dozen by a graphic description of a
                     new restaurant just opened. The excitement increased when he added that he had
                     been invited to dinner with his friends. The excitement moderated when it
                     became known a carriage would be necessary, the price of which would alone be
                     equal to that of a good dinner. The party still decided on going.
                  The restaurant was found with some difficulty, and the landlord seemed
                     embarrassed. He nevertheless welcomed his guests to his barroom, his 
                        billard
                        billiard
                      saloon and pistol gallery. The liquor was tolerable, and the runs at
                     billiards not so bad; still the landlord's barkeeper seemed ignorant that the
                     visitors were guests, and bar, billiards and pistol gallery cost more money
                     than the carriages. The guests grew restive and recollected that their object
                     in coming was dinner. The latter at length was announced—and such a dinner! The
                     staple of the meal was croakers and sour claret. The guests were furious. What
                     added to their disgust was that the landlord appeared the picture of
                     contentment and serenity. Instead of thanking him for his meal, they coldly
                     demanded their bill. It was the turn of Boniface now to look offended.
                  "But you are my guests, gentlemen," said he, "there is no charge." The soft
                     impeachment was declined. The guests point blank preferred paying to attempting
                     a gratitude they were unable to feel. One with fiery whiskers, who had
                     distinguished himself at the pistol gallery, intimated that satisfaction was
                     due him for having invited him to such a meal. Thus hard pressed, the landlord
                     stated that the honor of dining so distinguished a party was totally unexpected
                     until its arrival, and that he had been taken by surprise. But the fact was he
                     had done his best.
                  There was nothing to do but to curse the originator of the enterprise, whose
                     unauthorized invitation had involved the eating of an indigestible meal, and a
                     passage of arms with the landlord, who was not after all much to blame, and to
                     get back to town with what spirits and resolutions they could.
                  On another occasion our Amphitrion was presented to an acquaintance whose
                     conversation afforded him so much satisfaction, that an invitation to dinner
                     for himself and friends was offered upon the spot. The party was lively, the
                     liquor only moderately adulterated, and dinner no worse than one is ordinarily
                     condemned to eat. Unfortunately our Amphitrion was disposed to show himself in
                     a controversial mood. He attacked every one in the party upon their weakest
                     side. The dinner concluded stormily. By the time the dessert was brought in the
                     host had torn the coat of the distinguished guest from the tails to the collar,
                     and the distinguished guest was beating the hospitable giver of the feast with
                     a claret bottle over the head. The party brought up at the police station, and
                     the restaurateur has been inquiring from that day to this who is to pay for the
                     dinner.
                  The last hospitable feat told of him was of his having persuaded a
                     florid-complected arrival to keep him company until the close of the third
                     dinner. It then appeared that our Amphitrion had forgotten some point in the
                     fare, and that it was necessary to descend below to repair his error. He
                     succeeded with some difficulty in getting down the stairs, but failed totally
                     in ever getting back. Restaurateur and guests have ever since had their minds
                     filled with the worst forbodings, and he is informed, if this notice should
                     happen to encounter his eye, that by making his appearance he will learn
                     something, as Artemus Ward would say, to his advantage.
               
               
                  XI—The Adventures of a Marquis.
                  Old Anthony Fernandez, who was recently before the Second District Court on a
                     suit for interdiction, has had rather a gay and amusing life of it for some
                     seventy odd summers, it would appear from the revelations of witnesses and old chroniclers of scandal. The battle
                     of New Orleans found him a musician in one of the companies that went from the
                     city, and the adventurous Anthony doubtless understood how to make as much out
                     of his exploits as if he had been the "Drummer Boy of the Rappahannock"
                     himself. This country, at any rate became, after the battle, too small to
                     contain him. His father, who had been a prosperous undertaker, dying about this
                     time, and leaving him possessed of a considerable fortune, Anthony lost no time
                     in crossings the waters, and spent some time at the College of Henry IV. He had
                     the reputation of being one of the handsomest men of his day, and not
                     overscrupulous with one sex or the other. What with his money, his good looks,
                     and his unbounded cheek, the adventures of Gil Blas were nothing to his. A
                     duchess became desperately enamored of him, and Anthony despairing of making
                     Europeans believe that Americans were so stupid as to have no nobility,
                     determined to adopt a title for himself. The "Marquis of Barataria" was the
                     name he then successfully went by, until in an evil hour he gave a countryman
                     the cold shoulder, and the title was publicly proclaimed to be one of his own
                     invention.
                  The best known of his adventures in Europe was in connection with the
                     celebrated divorce case of George IV., brought against Queen Caroline for
                     adultery, and in which Anthony was summoned as a witness. Rumor had it that
                     while she was once traveling inconnue in
                     Italy, she met up with the fascinating Anthony, and made him much happier than
                     her husband. However this may be, Anthony was not introduced upon the stand;
                     and another rumor had it that ¥10,000 were paid to buy him off.
                  Coming to this country, or rather to Mexico, he next became involved in some
                     intrigue there, which caused him to receive notice to quit. His intrigue with
                     the Mexican Cleopatra appears to have dampened the ardor of Anthony in this
                     direction. He found his way back to New Orleans, and in the less romantic role
                     of auctioneer contrived to regain some of the money he had so readily spent in
                     his younger days.
                  The war found him so violent a Confederate that nothing but the arrival of Gen.
                     Butler in the city could induce him to become a good Union citizen. But the
                     strong patriotism he always manifested on the occasion of every election was
                     insufficient to secure him any office, and it is said that his disgust at the
                     ingratitude of republics was what brought on his first alienation of mind.
                  It was about a year ago that, finding his health failing, he betook himself to
                     Paris, and sought a resting place in one of the Maisons
                        de Sante, with which that city abounds. It was to one of these he
                     went, where the nurses are of that class of penitents that seek by acting in
                     such capacities to atone for former errors. Once inside this institution
                     Anthony's old luck overtook him. His nurse made him sleek and fat, and the
                     Marquis, from gratitude, or perhaps from infatuation for the lady, (spoken of
                     as amiable, good natured and pretty) brought her to this country and married
                     her. The marriage was not a fortunate one. It gave rise to a suit for
                     interdiction, and about the time this was disposed of, the unhappy lady met
                     with a violent death. Her dress had caught fire and before it could be
                     extinguished she was a corpse.
               
               
                  XII.—Virtue.
                  —— night was remarkable for its serenity and the clearness of the sky. It was
                     bound in blue and gold, as we heard some one remark. At every window, and upon
                     every door-sill, these were dead loads of pretty houris rendered languisantes by the heat, and apparently ready, to
                     judge from the relaxed expression of more than one, to drop for life into the
                     arms of any moderately amiable youth, who had the animation or energy to
                     propose. So long as the thermometer continues to stand where it does, it would
                     be impossible for any inamorata to make much resistance.
                  The moonlight, indeed, was so provocative of sentiment, that even steadfast
                     talkers of politics, and of the price of cotton or stocks, more than once
                     forgot their cue, and turned an approving glance heavenward. It suggested a
                     story that was told, and the only satisfaction the listener has where the
                     narrator is long winded, is that he may repeat the narrative to other
                     sufferers.
                  It was of a youth, who was, sometimes, good-natured in the disposition of his
                     money, and who once, when a poor neighbor lost her child, contributed one-half
                     of the money needed toward purchasing a coffin. He did more—he rode to the
                     cemetery in a carriage, and Providence, as if to reward his for his goodness of
                     heart, placed him as vis-a-vis of a very
                     pretty fellow-mourner. The acquaintance subsequently ripened into an intimacy,
                     but about this our hero acted badly. Another expedition was soon afterward
                     made, but this time it was to a restaurant, and on arriving there the affair
                     took such a turn that acquaintance, friendship and intimacy all ended between
                     the two.
                  The couple did not happen together for a long time afterwards, and when they
                     did the young man was out of business and employment, and had a rather hungry
                     cast of countenance. His appearance was so suggestive that it led to
                     explanation, and the result of it was a naive tender of one of those diminutive
                     pocket books which the other sex carry—a generous offer which of course was
                     declined. The goodness of heart, however, which suggested the offer, made a
                     lifetime impression—suggested remorse and reform, and an honest proposal.
                     Active employment for the young man soon followed, and last night, for aught
                     that is known to the contrary, the two lovers were in common, perhaps, with
                     hundreds of couples all over the city, indulging in sweet unison in all manner
                     of happy dreams for the future.
               
               
                  XIII—An Impromptu Wedding.
                  At the party given by Madame X——, a number of young people of social
                     temperaments were assembled together, and the mistress of the mansion was the
                     gayest of her guests. The affair, altogether, was like an ordinary gay party,
                     and the only thing worth remarking upon the occasion was a full grown doll,
                     which could be seen from the principal saloon, and which in dress and general
                     appearance bore a resemblance to the hospitable hostess.
                  In fact it was taken for a living personage by a young man whose sight, either
                     through natural or artificial causes, was weak—who vowed that he had become the
                     victim of love at first sight, and who absolutely insisted, too, upon becoming
                     acquainted with the unknown.
                  The young man not yet having been formally presented to the hostess, and the
                     sudden passion having been made known to her, the situation suggested a
                     practical joke. The intoxicated youth was presented to the lady of the house as
                     the mysterious unknown; a conversation soon ensued of the kind that is sacred
                     to lovers. The waxen dummy was forgotten—the sudden passion proceeded, at least
                     upon one side, with the most outrageous intensity. In short, there was a
                     declaration, and the proposal was declared to be reciprocated. The most absurd
                     part of the adventure (which followed after the flow of champagne) was that a
                     clergyman was introduced duced—it was agreed that the marriage ceremony should
                     then and there take place, and the joke actually carried
                     ont.
                  At this point, unable to continue the joke any further, the pretended bride did
                     not appear any more during the evening, and took it for granted that the
                     bridegroom, would soon discover the jest. But the morning after it became
                     evident to her mind that no explanation had been made whatever. Indeed, the
                     young bridegroom, it appeared, had been escorted to what was pointed out to him
                     as the bridal-chamber, and congratulated upon his good fortune; then; too, it
                     was shown that he had left the house in a way which indicated flight sometime
                     during the night.
                  But, what added to the mystery was, that the doll had disappeared from the room
                     in which it had been left, and required some search to discover it. The affair,
                     altogether, ended so droll, and the young hostess was so much exasperated at
                     the impertinence of some of her guests, that much less was said about it than
                     might have been expected, by one of the principal parties to the joke. The
                     affair, besides, led to a wild rumor that the bridegroom had been married to
                     one of the full-grown wax figures commonly exposed in milliners' windows. At
                     any rate, if the details appear a little muddy or difficult to be understood,
                     it was owing to the fact that the bridegroom has not since appeared, to the
                     ridiculous perversion and continuation, of what would otherwise have been a
                     very nice joke, and not to any misstatements of our reliable informant.
               
               
                  XIV—Adventures on the Night of the Riot.
                  It has occasioned some surprise among Smith's friends, who have always known
                     him for a quiet citizen, to learn that he was recently mixed up in the riots,
                     and that he played, at the time in question, an unusually lively role. To see a quiet-looking, slow, poking
                     philosopher, roaming through the city like a wehr wolf, or like a Malay running
                     a muck, is a fact that requires some explanation, and Smith has kindly
                     furnished us with a narrative of his adventures. On the evening in question, he
                     was the victim of two or three awkward blunders. In the first place, a wag had
                     fastened, as a joke, a Radical badge to his coat collar, and he had paraded
                     through town in happy unconsciousness of the fact. Secondly, as if one blunder
                     in this direction was not enough, upon being teazed about being a Radical, the
                     bright idea had occurred to him of announcing himself a recent convert to
                     carpet-bag principles and of defending every act of petty larceny, wholesale
                     swindling, rape, murder, etc., that any of the followers of that faith had been
                     guilty of. Thirdly, about the time the riot had commenced somebody had mistaken
                     him for Wickliffe, Conway, or some of that crowd. All of these facts crowding
                     rather fast upon the heels of each other, and the alarm about the riot
                     occurring just at that moment, poor Smith soon found himself surrounded by a
                     crowd who gazed upon him with an unkindly eye, and who thought his movements
                     would bear watching. Shortly after the first pistol shot was fired, and Smith
                     was suspected of being the man who did the firing.
                  With such a start as this, some of Smith's adventures for the night may be
                     easily guessed at. Discovering that he was in a dangerous neighborhood, he made
                     a break down Canal street with some start of his pursuers, but went head-over
                     heels against the chains on the neutral ground, his followers yelling, "Hit him
                     again" as he fell. Recovering himself now, he struck down Royal, Dumaine,
                     Villere, and thence to one of the markets, and was there lucky enough to be
                     lost in the crowd.
                  His adventures, however, were not yet ended. On his way back home he was fired
                     at, he says, a half a dozen times from colored clubs and coffee-houses, and
                     once while endeavoring to secrete himself behind a corner, narrowly escaped
                     being arrested on a charge of attempting to set fire to the premises. To
                     conclude Smith's own account of his adventures, after going through all these
                     trials and tribulations, he was subsequently locked up by the Coroner as being
                     the Smith who had taken part in one of the murders up town, and who had fired
                     at the crowd from a gallery.
                  Smith could be perhaps induced to come down in some of his statements, but
                     there is no doubt that things were made uncommonly lively about him on the
                     night in question.
               
               
                  XV—The Voudou Dance.
                  About the commencement of the last fashionable season, a young girl of about
                     twenty years of age came to the city and secured a residence at one of the best
                     known of our up-town boarding schools. She came, at the time of her arrival,
                     from one of the parishes up the coast, whither she had been to visit some of
                     her nearest relatives. At the times of her arrival it was announced that she
                     was on her way to the residence of her guardian in Mississippi, (her parents,
                     also of that State, being dead,) and that in his house she would make her
                     permanent home.
                  Once established comfortably in the large boarding-school above referred to, it
                     came to be remarked that one week after another passed away, and still the
                     young lady made no move toward starting home. This event, however, did not
                     excite much attention. It had now been ascertained that her father while alive
                     had been a physician (by birth an Italian) of considerable scientific
                     attainments, and had spent most of his time in classifying the various genera
                     and species of insects and reptilia to be found in the South. In assisting him
                     to classify his specimens and arranging his cases, his daughter had shown
                     extraordinary aptitude, and had even acquired some of the learned doctor's
                     fondness for insects, bugs, and various species of serpents. It was even
                     whispered that she had acquired from her father a knowledge of the power of
                     taming serpents, and had paid much attention to the African superstitions of
                     the servants by whom she was surrounded. By one of these, an old nurse, she was
                     attended on other visit to the city.
                  It was also alleged that the young girl's relative and friends, at the death of
                     her parents, had viewed with disgust what appeared to be her growing tastes in
                     this direction, and with this feeling were not sorry to see her established at
                     a fashionable school where she could occupy her time in literary pursuits, or
                     in receiving company, as might suit her disposition.
                  During the two or three first months of her residence in this city, she
                     received many invitations in society, and partly from her independence of
                     manner, partly from her reputation for wealth and attainments, met with a more
                     than ordinary flattering reception. Other causes added to these. Though there
                     was a certain obliquity of vision in her eyes, and though these latter were of
                     an emerald or sea-green hue, with red-rimmed eyelids, and though her features
                     ordinarily appeared livid and swollen, there were certain extraordinary traits
                     and features which attracted connoisseurs of female beauty. In spite of this
                     attraction, she was always seen alone on the streets, and received none of the
                     visitors who attempted to cultivate her acquaintance.
                  To this statement there was one exception. A gentleman connected with a firm of
                     trust and
                     responsibility was the son of her guardian. Him it was necessary to receive as
                     the agent of her family. As all of her letters, remittances and information
                     from home came through his hands, it was necessary to see him frequently.
                  Of course it soon transpired that the young girl was violently in love with the
                     factor. It came to be suspected that so far from being upon her way to return
                     to her friends that she had visited the city with the express purpose of
                     gaining his love.
                  It furthermore was made evident that her powers of fascination were at an
                     absolute discount in this quarter, that the gentleman was already engaged to
                     another lady, and that the marriage was shortly to be consummated.
                  During the months that these facts were slowly being brought to light, she had
                     mostly occupied herself with the studies proper to a young lady whose education
                     is nearly completed, though still paying much more attention to natural history
                     than to any other branch. It was subsequently made to appear that she had
                     visited several public institutions in disguise on Mardi Gras night; that she
                     had been in attendance at all the side-shows about the levee, where serpents
                     are exhibited, and that she had had interviews with the various astrologists,
                     clairvoyants, fortune-tellers of the city, and with even that still darker and
                     more dangerous class of pretenders who claim to be able to shape the future by
                     our wishes and passions.
                  Thus much stated it remains now to be described what occurred on the night of
                     the first of June.
                  The first of June, as is known to old gossips, is the time of year that is
                     devoted by the Voudou worshipers to the celebration of their most sacred rites.
                     It is at this period they retire to the Lake-end, and indulge in frequent
                     suppers and midnight bathing, and that the dances and other superstitious
                     observances are practiced with the most vigor and intensity. Any one who is
                     curious to pay them a visit can do so by proceeding to the Lake-end of the
                     Pontchartrain Railroad, and going down the road on the right hand side of the
                     track for half-a-mile.
                  The great Voudou event of Monday was the crowning of a new Queen in place of
                     the celebrated Marie Levau, who now numbers some sixty or seventy years of age,
                     and who, it need hardly be said, is too old to longer discharge the onerous
                     duties of the office. As most of these followers of the fetish faith are in
                     reality nothing but worshipers of Venus or Astarte, that is to say, of youth
                     and beauty, they naturally are among the first to grow impatient of old age,
                     and so Queen Marie, in spite of the dread with which her name is regarded,
                     finds it best to resign the magic sceptre.
                  A curious study would be the rise and growth of this dark superstition among
                     our colored, and, in some cases, foreign populations, though it doubtless has
                     always existed in some form or other since the first Africans were brought to
                     this country.
                  Old Marie herself, whose influence and power have been wielded without question
                     for the last twenty years, appears to have been originally a nurse and old
                     family servant, known to all the old population, and at one time in great
                     request in dressing the bodies of the dead. It was from this occupation that
                     her pretensions to be the priestess of a religion, and to have the power of
                     affecting events by spells and harm, doubtless arose.
                  Her power was greatly disputed at one time by a rival who had the enterprise to
                     send to Africa for a large doll-like idol, and which, when dressed and
                     bedevilled with beads, tattoo marks and all manner of Congo toggery, produced a
                     tremendous impression among the credulous. It was regarded by Marie as such a
                     dangerous talisman that the idol was carried away—was brought at one time
                     before the Recorder for him to decide whose property it was, or whether any
                     violence had been used in wresting it from its first owner. However, the scales
                     of justice inclined against Rosalie; the magic doll was decreed to the Queen,
                     who doubtless had the most power as a procuress, and from that time to this the
                     Voudou Queen has swayed the minds of thousands of believers in this city. It is
                     probable that there are at this time a dozen altars in different parts of
                     town.
                  This much stated, we return to the night of the anniversary.
                  At that time the event had become known to the class who keep familiar with the
                     gossip about courts and ballrooms, cockpits and other places of resort in the
                     Second District, and the fast men of the town, who had availed themselves of
                     the opportunity to be present, saw the chapel which had been fitted up for the
                     occasion, thronged with numerous worshipers at the mystic rites, most of whom
                     were women and quadroons, though mixed somewhat with foreign-born guests, and
                     with one or two who were obviously to the manor born. These women were all
                     dressed elaborately, some of them in bridal costume, and with an extraordinary
                     regard to the fineness and purity of their underclothing and linen. At one end
                     of the chapel a corpse was exposed.
                  The rites having commenced, an elderly turbaned female, dressed in yellow and
                     red, ascended a sort of dais and chanted a wild sort of fetish song, to which
                     the others kept up an accompaniment with their voices and with a drum-like beat
                     of their hands and foot. At the same time they commenced to slowly move in a
                     circle, while gradually increasing the time. As the motion gained in intensity
                     the flowers and other ornaments disappeared from their hair, and their dresses
                     were torn open, and each one conducted herself like a bacchante. Every one was
                     becoming drunk and intoxicated with the prevailing madness and excitement. As
                     they danced in the circle, in the centre of which stood a basket with a dozen
                     hissing snakes whose heads were projecting from the cover, each corybante
                     touched the serpent's head with her brand.
                  In the midst of that saturnalia of witches, the pythoness of the extraordinary
                     dance and revel was a young girl, with bare feet, and costumed en chemise, in one hand she held a torch, and with
                     wild, maniacal gestures, headed the band. In this awful state of nudity she
                     continued her ever increasing frantic movements, until reason itself abandoned
                     its earthly tenement.
                  In a convulsive fit she finally fell, foaming at the mouth like one possessed,
                     and it was only then that the mad carnival found a pause. The girl was torn
                     half dead from the scene, and has never yet been restored to her faculties; but
                     enough was

                      of her history to discover that, in despair of ever realizing her
