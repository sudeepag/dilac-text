            DEDICATION.
            To the good people of the South in general, those who, by descent and education can fully appreciate the difficulties attending a work like this, and who, from natural inclinations, as well as from the memories of their childhood and the associations of their manhood, can thoroughly comprehend the magnitude of the evils this book is intended to expose, and who, from their long acquaintance with the customs of our people, have a heart-felt horror of all immigration and reform schemes other than those inaugurated by ourselves;—and specially to the people of Tennessee who have so recently been relieved from the demoniac rule of madmen and robbers, and who have been insulted as no other people ever were by the plague of the Carpet-baggers' visitation;—but still more specially to that portion of our people whose hatred of puritanism, vandalism, barbarism, and yankeeism in general is ineradicably fixed in their hearts; who are the 
                  frends
                  friends
                of refinement and social purity; the enemies of disorder and amalgamation; the friends of woman and womanly virtues; the enemies of female men and masculine women; and who, from their innate love of their ancestry and the ancient institutions of our people know how with proper emotions to scorn and hate any and every thing belonging to Yankees but their money; who, in the innermost recesses of their hearts loathe the Carpet-bagger and all his vulgar notions of social order; who hate with a deepened, burning, withering scorn, every man, woman and child born north of the Ohio, inheriting revolutionary ideas of civilization, public schools, education of the masses, equality of men, elevation of labor, association with the poor, extinction of caste, universal suffrage, nigger schools, etc.; who have solemnly resolved to perpetuate their hatred of the North by teaching it to their children at home, in the Sabbath school, in the church, on the play-ground, and in the colleges;—and lastly, to our noble, high-minded, modest, amiable, kind, patriotic, christian ladies,—(excluding them of course who have a fellow-feeling for young Yankees,)—this work is respectfully dedicated by
            
               THE AUTHOR.

            INTRODUCTION.
            Natural History, as a Science, has not, perhaps, been studied as much, and with as great success, by Americans as many other branches of learning. Yet, while this is the fact, our country has furnished many of the most interesting subjects of that fascinating department of knowledge. Out of the multitudinous array of objects thus brought to the notice of the world as productions of this continent, one has been omitted. This arises partly, it is fair to presume from the fact that it has but recently been discovered.
            It has had voluminous notices in the press of the country which have called public attention to its existence and justly excited a great deal of curiosity in regard to it; yet, the peculiar habits, the manner of life, the comparative utility, etc., of this recent accession to the lists of American novelties have been strangely overlooked.
            Having had excellent opportunities for observing this singular creature in all its varied phases of existence, and having studied its habits very carefully for several years, it is my purpose even at the risk of being thought dry and tedious, to give my readers an accurate and reliable history of the animal in question.
            Opinions, owing doubtless, to the ignorance of the persons holding them, or from metaphysical causes which it is not my purpose here to discuss, very widely differ as to the precise place in the scale of living things which should be assigned to it. All, however, seem to have agreed that it is more human than divine; and also that it may properly be classed with one, or between two species of the family of man.
            While one school of observers put it beneath the African, indeed at the lowest end of the human line, another considers it a fit companion of the Negro. Another class look upon it as a place hunter, a miserable adventurer spewed out from the offal of the North,—a vile barbarian unfit for human society, a pest, a thieving, plundering vagabond at large to scourge and curse the world and poison its peace. Still another class, (but that is composed of fools and fanatics who know nothing whatever of its habits or history,) look upon it as a valuable auxilliary in the work of national resuscitation and reform. Of this class I may name Wendall Phillips, Charles Sumner and Schuyler Colfax.
            Inasmuch as its home is in the Southern States chiefly, it is proper here that I insert a description written by a learned and valuable Author who has given the matter a great deal of serious attention. He is a Southern man, and his statement is therefore entitled to very great respect. From his copious 
                  illustra-
                  illustrations
                and descriptions, I have selected the as most aptly and felicitously expressing his gigantic thoughts. He says: "The genus 'Carpet-bagger' is a man with a lank head of dry hair; a lank stomach and long legs; club knees and splay feet; dried legs and lank jaws, with eyes like a fish and a mouth like a shark. Add to this, a habit of sneaking and dodging about in unknown places,—habiting with negroes in dark dens and back streets,—a look like a hound, and a smell like a pole cat." [See Southern Naturalist, page 42.]
            At a very large Convention of impartial observers, recently held in Kentucky, over whose deliberations my accomplished friend Mr. Nasby presided, the proceedings of which have already been given to the literary world, a very comprehensive description,—possibly too general for the critical reader, was given of the name of this itinerant biped, intending to convey at once in brief terms a full idea of the whole subject.
            That Convention, remarkable as well for its learning as for the purity morals, resolved:
            "That all northern Republicans here is Carpet-baggers, and all northern democrats is not." [See Toledo Blade.]
            In order correctly to understand this definition, it is necessary first to have a proper idea of what a 'northern Republican here' is, and as that nowadays is a matter in itself very debatable, it might be well for the reader not to place full reliance upon this resolution. It however, shows what the Kentucky opinion is on the subject.
            The description quoted from the Naturalist published in Alabama, may safely be regarded as the better one; for the Kentuckians perhaps, have not had as good facilities for acquiring correct information in this respect as the people farther south.
            
            I am reliably informed that from some local causes not heretofore properly understood and appreciated by the Government and man kind generally, but which seems to be peculiar to that gallant State, the Carpet-bagger, or, to use still another and possibly more accurate term, this "white cuticle scoundrel" is not much seen there. He is generally found farther south where there was more war.
            But it is with the creature as he is found in Tennessee that I propose more particularly to deal. For the past few years he has attracted a great deal of public attention here and justly excited a laudable degree of curiosity among the lovers of the marvellous. Although our experience has not proven him to be physically dangerous, yet all of our best people avoid him as they would a leper, and would rejoice to have the country rid of him entirely. In this State, of which I have the honor to be an humble citizen, the Carpet-bagger is thus pointedly and 
                  elegantiy
                  elegantly
                described by one of our most distinguished and honorable citizens, Hon. Erastus Jones, in a speech 
                  deliverered
                  delivered
                before the Smithville Agricultural Association sometime during the past year. He said:
            "The Carpet-bagger belongs to a class whose friendship is robbery, whose love is lust, whose God is gold, whose gospel is a contract whose religion is fanaticism, 
                  whose whose
                  whose
                churches are change houses, whose characters are commodities, and whose truth is a lie. He is an insolent white livered thief 
                  who who
                  who
                would run from a grasshopper if it had claws. He is an ass in a lion's skin who hectors over you and destroys your substance; a miserable adventurer, a cutthroat, assassin, murderer of women and children, a ruffian and despoiler."
            Many of the people of the north are foolish enough to imagine that the Carpet-bagger is a man of high moral culture, and of great usefulness in society. But they are mistaken; they know nothing of this extraordinary personage except what they get from hired letter writers, and that is all false. Here he is seen in perfection. Our climate and natural 
                  attrctions
                  attractions
                seem to be favorable to his growth. From the best data within my reach I compute the number now in this State at about twenty thousand, and this in four years.
            They are scattered all over the State, but chiefly in the best agricultural and mineral regions, and about the cities and towns. They have given us a great deal of trouble and annoyance; and if we did not take a great deal of pains to combine our strength and influence against them, they would to-day have all the ancient usages and customs of our people thoroughly revolutionized. We are not enamored with this new class of people. We don't like them; we hate them: we despise them from the very bottoms of our hearts.
            But to return to the description.
            It is a habit with us that whenever any one of our leading men makes a statement on any important subject, we all endorse that statement and apply it in all proper places without modification. Here we follow our leaders. That is our uniform custom and has been for a great many years. If it had not been for this commendable practice, the result of our late unhappy differences would have been known much sooner. Indeed I am of opinion that if such had not been our character, there would not have been any war at all. It is because of this peculiar trait that I am constrained to adopt the extract above quoted from Mr. Jones's speech as my idea of the genus Carpet-bagger. We are not apt to adopt any thing new here or to attempt anything new. What is said by the proper person is always properly said, and we at once adopt it. And then that speech was by a native Tennesseean at a time and place when there was nothing whatever in the occasion to require any reference to the subject at all.
            Therefore we may rely on the expression as being entirely free from all passion and prejudice. This latter fact gives it additional weight with our people who are, upon principle, opposed to inflated and passionate expressions on any subject.
            We like the plain unvarnished truth; that and nothing more.
            Now with this, as with all other species of men, "male and female created He them." The resemblance between the sexes, so far as we know,—( for we never go near the female because of her shyness and modesty )—is very similar to that in all other races. Except when married, and 
                  occasioually
                  occasionally
                then, the female Carpet bagger is generally engaged in teaching young Yankees or our niggers. It is this disgusting habit which makes her so objectionable to our people. We don't want our niggers to know any more than they do; and if we did, we should greatly prefer to select the teachers ourselves; for then we could instruct them to our own liking. With us a little learning has proved a "dangerous thing" sometimes. There are a great many of our native white people who do not know how to read or write their own names, and they make most excellent, obedient citizens. Just what we bid them, that they do. We have managed to get on well this way for many years, and we prefer still to walk in the footsteps of our fathers.
            We want no innovations; we dont need them; they pester and vex us.
            It is a very painful sight to the eyes of a high toned gentleman of the South to see a swarm of 
                  liitle
                  little
                niggers, dressed up like white children, hopping along the streets every morning with their arms full of yankee books, going to one of these female Carpet-bagger's schools.
            The practice is very annoying, and it is our intention to have it discontinued at the very earliest practicable period. We have already destroyed a large number of their school houses and driven the teachers away, and in this or some other equally effective manner, we confidently expect in a very few years to be relieved of them all.
            But we are beginning to fear much greater trouble in an entirely new direction. We had expected that when we would get rid of these hateful creatures, their mischief-making power would be gone; but I am compelled to say to the world that in this we may have been mistaken, for the infernal niggers themselves are beginning to open schools of their own. This is more than we can long endure; and some means must be devised to break it up.
            But this is intended only as a general introduction to my subject, 
                  in in
                  in
                order that from the description already given, the reader may have a fair conception of the personal appearance of this most detestable of all living creatures, while in the following pages I trace its history and expose its viscious and dangerous habits. Therefore I will cease introducing and begin my work.
         
      
      
         
            The carpet-bagger in Tennessee
            
               CHAPTER I.
               
                  Who and what I am—Unsatisfactory condition of things on my return from the South—The first Carpet-baggers—Contrabands—Prudence in the family—Committee system.
               
               My father, General George Washington Bascom, was one of the pioneers of this noble State. When he died he left me, his youngest son, one fine plantation with seventy niggers in Mississippi, and five large farms with one hundred and thirty niggers in Tennessee. I married into the family of Col. John Randolph Armstead of Virginia, whose Grandfather was a second cousin by marriage of James Madison. My wife had some real estate and about fifty likely young niggers. My Grandfather who by marriage was nearly related to Patrick Henry, at an early day emigrated from Virginia to North Carolina where my father was born. But he, as before remarked, came early to Tennessee where all of his children were born and raised.
               I have been thus particular in giving my lineage because otherwise my statements might not be considered so reliable, nor be so favorably received by the southern reader; for with us "to the manor born," it is always desirable to know something of a man's connections in order to know just how much to believe of what he says. As to my children, I don't know that that is important.
               We look more to that which has been before, than to what comes after in a man's history. There are a great many niggers in the country who bear our old family name, but they were not all members of our family. We are not responsible for their names, nor for the family resemblance borne by some of the brighter ones. It was a custom with us that all slaves took the name of their masters, and as we had a great many, our name was borne by hundreds of them wherever we have lived.
               My education also was good. Between tween Hartford University and West Point Military Academy my minority was spent. I had abundance of means at my command; so that in this respect I need not complain.
               I held a Major's Commission in the United States Army, but resigned some twenty years ago; and when our late unhappy differences arose, I felt it to be my duty to give my voice in favor of the South. I occupied a high position in the Confederate States Government. I never had any doubt of the correctness of my course in that particular, for I have always been a constitutional democrat, and of course believed in states' rights. Although for the sake of peace I yielded to superior numbers, still my opinions are not in the least modified.
               Before the war I was considered a good liver, and I must say that I was very comfortably situated. I had a few small debts due to firms in Philadelphia and New York, but I preferred not to pay them; and not knowing what would be the result of the war, or what might befall me during its progress, before leaving home I took the precaution, along with a great many of my good neighbors, to place the title to all my property in the name of my wife and children. I have since had great reason to approve that course, for upon my return from the seat of government, I found my finances greatly embarrassed through the loss of my niggers; and although in general I am opposed to bankrupt laws, I was compelled through force of circumstances to avail myself of the benefits confered by the recent enactment on that subject. Perhaps three hundred gentlemen in my county were compelled to do likewise.
               My prudence in turning my property over to my wife was greatly to my advantage in this matter. It relieves me of all further embarrassment, for with her property, we will have a great plenty to do us the remainder of our natural lives, and our children will not be compelled to change their habits of life.
               My home is in the city of Smithville situated on the banks of the 
                     Tennesssee
                     Tennessee
                   River not more than two hundred miles from the Capitol of the State. As to my manner of life, that has nothing whatever to do with this book; but I will say that I am living off the income of my wife's 
                     propefty
                     property
                  .
               It is a singular fact that our people have a great fondness for villes.
               There is Nashville, the Capitol of the State; Knoxville, where Brownlow lives; Greenville, Andy Johnson's home; Brownsville, where the famous decision on the suffrage law was rendered that liberated Tennessee; Clarksville on the Cumberland, where two thousand hogsheads of tobacco are sold every year; Shelbyville, where there is a splendid female academy; and a hundred others I could name. I have frequently observed that our northern friends do not pronounce these very common names correctly. They 
                     pro-
                     pronounce
                   them just as they are spelled, Nashvil, Knoxvil, etc. We prefer Nashvul, Knoxvul, &c. But this is mere matter of taste. I mention it in passing only as one among the many barbarous provincialisms of our less educated neighbors.
               Ante bellum, in each of the two great political parties, we had our regularly organized central and executive committees whose business it was to inaugurate measures and conduct campaigns. The common people never knew or cared what to do until they were instructed by these committees. The whigs were always greatly delighted with our quarrels with Andy Johnson, for he never would come under the control of our committees. When there was any difference, Johnson always proved the master. (By the way, that man Johnson has done us a great deal of harm; it is doubtful if we can ever make him 
                     servicerble
                     serviceable
                   to us again.)
               I was speaking of committees.
               When the war came on we had no time to differ among ourselves. We abandoned all minor and party matters, and organized for the great fight. This brought us into closer contact with each other, and our old committee-men acted in harmony.
               Whatever valuable lessons had been learned by each in his earlier official career was of great service to us in this combined effort. With us this committee system is a matter of principle, and is of vast importance in the administration of public affairs. It keeps the power and intelligence where they should be,—in the hands of a few leading men whose learning and experience, as well as their social position, places the propriety of their conduct beyond all question. The common people, the farmers, mechanics and day laborers should never be entrusted with the secrets of government, or with the machinery of any great movement. Here we do not permit anything of the kind. In this respect we have a great advantage over many other people. Our people are trained in this way from their youth up, and hence they expect nothing else; they are always ready to do as we who advise dictate. I will hereafter have frequent occasion to prove the value of this kind of social arrangement in the great ease with which our citizens fall in with the opinions and advice of the leaders.
               Upon my return to Smithville in the summer of 1865, I found a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. Every thing was wrong. Had it not been for the fact that there was a regiment or two of yankee troops stationed here, I should have advised resort to a very expeditious method of changing things to correspond with my notions of propriety. But on consultation with a few friends I concluded to give way temporarily to the necessities of the situation. I found that one of my wife's houses was occupied by the Post Quartermaster and his family; another by the agent of the Freedmen's Bureau—that indescribable 
                     nnisance
                     nuisance
                  ; and still another by the "Col. commanding." My good wife had been compelled to supply her necessities from the rents which the yankees paid her for these houses and from the income of some fifteen out-houses which she had rented to niggers. The beautiful grove I had left just outside the city was all cleared away, and some two thousand niggers congregated there in what was called a Contraband camp in about two hundred cabins built by the Bureau, and two very large school houses where two male, and two female 
                     capet-baggers
                     carpet-baggers
                   were teaching nigger schools.
               Now all this disgusted me very much, but what could I do about it?
               Who blames me for doing nothing? And to make the thing worse, I found on inquiry that my neighbors were all as bad off as myself.
               Most of the business houses of the city were closed, and the others used by men only who held permits from the authorities. Some of our people had disgraced themselves by taking the oaths required to obtain a permit to sell goods, and they were engaged in trade.
               At this time there were three Carpet-baggers in the city besides them at the nigger camp. One was selling goods and doing a flourishing business. His name, as I afterwards learned, was Pettibone. The other two were calling themselves lawyers and claim agents. One of these about a week after my arrival, called upon me, introduced himself as Charles Hapsburg, and said he had just settled here with his family, was anxious to become identified with the common interests of the country, etc., and gratuitously offered his services to me in any way that I could make them available in 
                     releiving
                     relieving
                   me from any embarrassment financial or otherwise under which I might labor consequent upon my relations to the war just closed. He said he had been connected with the United States army for some three or four years, and might possibly be of use to me. I of course with great dignity refused assistance from such a source, and he very politely retired.
               I did not even acknowledge myself under obligations to him for his apparently disinterested kindness, and I have sometimes since thought that in this I betrayed some ill feeling and ingratitude, for his manner was polite, friendly and dignified. But he was a yankee, and that was enough for me.
               The other lawyer of whom I have just spoken was one Captain McClintock, and he also had been a yankee officer. He had come to Smithville a short time earlier than the others and was engaged in the Bounty and Claim business.
               Here were three of these detestable villains already located in my own native town, and a nest of them on the outside on my wife's land. I at once set about to learn what I could of the character and habits of these people. I never did learn anything of the teachers in this respect, only that they attended church regularly in the day time but never at night, in plain, neat dresses, and behaved with becoming modesty. They were never shown to a pew, and therefore always took a back seat.
               The lawyers, it was said, were men of good deportment, were rarely ever seen except where business called them, and were never observed to go into a drinking saloon unless at the request of some of own citizens who had a claim to collect from the government, and then they did not drink anything stronger than ale or wine. And singular as it may appear, neither of them had ever been heard to use any vulgar or profane language, and both were members of the church to which I belonged. I very naturally and properly concluded that this show of good character was a mere ruse to gull our people, and so my neighbors thought. We therefore considered it our duty to our families and to society in general, to avoid these vermin, and have no intercourse whatever with them. This we advised our children and our neighbors' children.
               Hapsburg had but recently come and had not yet opened an office.
               His family was in a house rented from one of the yankee officers whose lease had not expired. He was not entirely a stranger to our people. He had been on duty here during the war about six months as Provost Marshall, and was said to have treated the people with uniform kindness. He had in several instances extended mercy when he might have been severe. Indeed some of our people were disposed to think well of the fellow. They said he was modest and retired in his manner, and just in his administration of the law military. One thing they had particularly observed; he never acted finally on any important matter until he had heard both sides.
               I was sorry to find so little discontent among my fellow townsmen at the presence of these miserable yankees. They really seemed to have become used to them and were not much disposed to give themselves any trouble about it. The thing that gave them most uneasiness was the nigger schools. To this they never would have submitted if there had been any safe way to avoid it. Nigger schools had been heard of never before in Tennessee, and their existence now was very painfull to the sensibilities of our good people.
               I said I was sorry to find so little dissatisfaction. But on reflection, I can't find much fault with them; for, as I have before remarked, they have always been in the habit of looking to their leaders for advice, and we were all absent. I have often since thought what a miserably slavish lot would have befallen them if our enemies had banished or hanged all of us who have so long ruled this country. They would have yielded without a struggle, and to day would have been as good yankees as these infamous wretches fresh from the north now settled in our midst. But, as we will soon see, upon our return affairs were quickly placed in a very different condition, and the sleeping fires of their true natures began to burn afresh.
               I said Hapsburg had not yet rented an office. He had been so much engaged in getting into his house and in arranging his family—a wife and four children,—that he had not yet made any effort to obtain a room for his business. Now, there were a great many vacant rooms in the city fit for such uses which it would have been very profitable to the owners to lease, but I made it my special business to see that no more buildings were leased to Carpet-baggers. It took but a word. Half an hour's work did it all; and although Captain Hapsburg passed about the streets daily for two weeks in search of a vacant room, to my infinite satisfaction, he was unable to find one.
               But after all my vigilance for his benefit, I was informed by a confidential friend on Monday of the third week that the Captain, with coat off and shirt sleeves rolled up, with water bucket and broom, was busily engaged cleaning up a small room in the very center of the town.
               I immediately set out to find the owner, Dr. Hartshorn, and demanded an explanation of his conduct.
               He replied that he generally did what he pleased with his own property; he thought he understood his business, etc.. On further conversation I learned from the Doctor that some niggers had been occupying the room for some months,—placed there by the officer in charge of the Bureau department; and in order to get rid of the niggers, and get the place cleaned out, he let Hapsburg have it for a year. This was some relief to me but it was not at all satisfactory. We could have scared the niggers out as soon as the soldiers left. I have always felt that the Doctor did wrong;—he should have consulted me, for he knew my wishes; but it was too late then. On the very next day a neat little sign, painted by a dutch yankee, was seen swinging over the door, inscribed "Charles Hapsburg, Attorney at Law" Inside, a fancy folding desk, with numberless pigeon-holes, stood in a corner, which with two chairs, was all the furniture in the room; and there, with his papers, sat the contemptible puppy.
               McClintock had already purchased a house and lot for his family residence; and he and Pettibone, who had no family, had rented their business rooms before my return, at a time when the citizens had no advisers, and I was unable to reach their case. I might have succeeded in getting McClintock ousted had it not been for the fact that he had volunteered to defend the owner of the building, Hon. John Smith, who was arrested and tried by a Military Commission on a charge of smuggling whisky through the lines. Besides this, Smith told me that McClintock had lent him five hundred dollars at a time when he was very much in need of pecuniary assistance, and it was not yet repaid. On this account he could not well consent to forfeit his word which was pledged to let the Captain have the room as long as he should want it by paying the rent promptly in advance.
               As to Pettibone's case, that was a mere matter of time. When the army would leave and we were ourselves again, we could soon make it too hot for him.
               But I found to my utter astonishment, that the partial demoralization of which I have before spoken, had reached even our ladies, who, I did think, could never be swerved from their ancient propriety. Some of our best families were ruined socially 
                     forver
                     forever
                  . There was Miss Lou Murdock, a beautiful and accomplished young lady, well connected and inheriting a large estate, had married a yankee sergeant. Miss Mollie McFlimsy,—old Doctor McFlimsy's daughter, whose prospects for a union with General Poodles of the 
                     Confederte
                     Confederate
                   army were flattering, married a quartermaster's clerk; and Miss Jennie Mackintosh, the Belle of the city, who could have married into any family in the south, ran away with a blue-bellied captain who,—(which makes the matter still worse)—commanded a company of niggers.
               When my wife told me of these cases, which indeed were the first things she did tell me after making me acquainted with the fact that the yankees were not paying half enough rent for her houses, I thought she was jesting; but it was all true.
               She had told me the plain truth, and I was seriously troubled to know what to do about it. I thought the matter over with all the seriousness I could command on so grave a subject, but was unable to come to any conclusion further than this: I determined to submit the
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               
                  More Carpet-baggers—Nigger schools—Our good ladies—The yankee soldiers leave—Jolly time.
               
               At the time of the opening of this Chapter, all our absent friends, except those who had fallen in the fight, had returned, and we were ready for concerted action in a new field. By this time a few more Carpet-baggers were in our midst, and the nigger schools still went on under a more systematic management however. An abolitionist preacher, named Holmes,—a lean, hungry looking old ruffian—was in charge of the sable colony squatted on other peoples' lands. It seems he was sent here by Freedmen's aid societies at the north, and his valuable services were paid for by them in connection with the churches there.
               What an abominable, low, mean, thieving set these yankees are; how little they know or care for the proprieties of civilized, life. This miserable scoundrel, calling himself a minister of Christ, looking as modest and sanctimonious as a son of St. Paul, and putting on all the dignity and good manners of a true gentleman, comes here to organize schools and churches among our niggers, and then to have the brazen-faced impudence to walk alone at mid-day on our streets where the eyes of all good people must helplessly look on the disgusting spectacle. And his family, look at them.
               His wife, a pale, careworn, over-worked looking creature dressed in plain calico, with an air of modesty that an angel might wear. The boy too, and the girl; the very fac similes of health and deviltry. These new lights; these heralds of the coming time; these Baptists crying in the wilderness of death; these pioneers of the new civilization! Great God! What a stupendous indignity! Oh! how long must it be endured.
               And those wretched, frizzle-haired, close-mouthed, brazen-faced—what shall I call them?—who sit there all the long day in the stink of a hundred niggers—our niggers on my wife's land—to teach them to read! Think of it reader! Ponder it son of the south! Give ear to the dreadful tale; then hate it, damn it, gnash your teeth at it, and help us spew it out of the land; then teach your babes to hate forever the whole infernal Yankee nation. But I will not let my passions get the better of me, at least not so soon.
               These accursed Lincoln hirelings, these blue coated murderers are still here. No; I'll wait til they are gone.
               Two more lawyers also, had by this time arrived; and as is their habit, at once concentrated their means and power. General Short became the partner of Hapsburg, and he was compelled to put his family in with that of his partner, for none of our people would ever have consented to rent a house to him. He was no stranger here.
               Our people remembered him as the fiend who commanded a horde of Dutch Yankee butchers in Tennessee during the war. Aye; they knew him, and they marked him.
               Hapsburg's sign still swung over his office door; but now another was pinned up beneath it. "Short & Hapsburg: Intelligence Office and Real estate Agency."
               It would be utterly impossible for me to describe the feelings of our people towards this hideous Yankee monster. I know not words that would express even an 
                     approxmate
                     approximate
                   idea of the intensity and virulence of their hatred and utter contempt of this short-legged, hump-backed, hawk-eyed villain. Let me see; "Perish the microcosm in the limitless macrocosm, and sink the feeble earthly segregate in the bound less, rushing, choral aggregation!"
               No; that don't express it, and yet I quote from the most brilliant author living. If I could command the vocabulary of St. Elmo, or but have a moment to spend at the fountain whence Miss Evans, our own accomplished, champion writer and world-renowned classical authoress drinks her comprehensive and accurately descriptive language, I might then feel equal to the work. But as it is I cannot do the subject justice. Therefore I desist, merely remarking as I leave the loathesome beast for the present, that had the coast been clear, his craven heart never would have been fed by the pure air of Smithville.
               The other lawyer was a neat looking, tall, good-natured, independent, pithy fool who, because he had insulted our people in the capacity of Judge Advocate for several months during the war, felt, doubtless, that he had some claim upon the credulity of the citizens, and he was known as Judge Brown.
               Besides these there was a long, gander-legged cut-throat named or called Coole—Lieutenant Coole. He was an entire stranger to our people, but the Carpet-baggers all knew him. He was as cool as his name indicated; cool as a cucumber in a July morning. There were still others here; two sun-burnt, stupid, houndish looking thieves, calling themselves farmers, and wanting to buy or lease lands, they said; but they were in the wrong pew as they soon discovered.
               Our situation was indeed deplorable; and we were in no way relieved by reflecting that there was no practical method of immediate escape. We suffered intensely; but we were not fools, and we took care that the authorities knew nothing of our real feelings. We played our part well. We made them think we were friendly. If a soldier passed us, we recognized him politely, tipped our hats to him; some would even smile on the barbarian, then turn about to chat with him. When an officer came near, we shook hands with him cordially, and invited him to dine with us next week, at which time we were certain to be called suddenly away from home.
               But in this, as we thought, very important matter, we never could control our women. They would not be hypocrites. A few of them—a very few—as I have heretofore remarked, did take a fancy to the Yankees, but ninety-nine out of every hundred of them despised the earth on which a Yankee stood. They abominated his name. They hated him with a virulence equal to the most refined essence of the concentrated venom of the damned, while being tortured in hell by the thrice augmented torment hurled upon them by the victorious armies of heaven, who had driven them from their ancient seats. When the ladies saw a Yankee coming, they quickly crossed to the other side of the street; and if they were compelled to meet or pass him, they were careful to press in their dresses so that they should not touch the loathsome creature. They would not permit even their skirts to touch him. And then, oh! what a profound, disdainful scorn hung upon their beautiful lips. If he passed their windows, they spit at him; if he passed them in company, they scoffed at him, and told him what they thought of him and his crew. What delightful beings these ladies are. How brave, how true to the South, and the cause their lovers and husbands love. But they would not do at that time to put forward as the exponents of Southern feeling. They were entirely too honest for that.
               As before remarked, the situation was deplorable, and we were justly alarmed. If we could only have prevailed on our women to be still and follow our advice, we could soon, as we thought, manage to convince the government that we had accepted the results of the war in good faith, and could get along without the presence ence of troops. But the ladies were constantly getting us into trouble. Hardly a day passed without some good, law abiding citizen being seen between two guards going to the Provost Marshal's office, with about a dozen of his neighbors behind him to testify that the rumor, whatever it was, had no foundation in fact, and that some excited lady who had lost a friend in the Confederate army had grown too loud in her lamentations, but that no harm or disrespect was intended. No; they, the ladies of Smithville, never did yield—with the exceptions I have named—and to be plain, I honestly believe they never will.
               It is an old maxim that "It is a long lane which has no turn." And so in this. When we were driven almost to desperation, and our spirits very low indeed with our inward heartburnings, we thought we saw some indications of the withdrawal of the troops. We became then more pleasant, and our ladies more morose and sullen. It seemed they wished the soldiers to remain, so that they might be under the withering influence of their scorn still longer. They were anxious to show their contempt for their persecutors, and that to their very faces. They were in a bad humor because they were to be deprived of this exquisite pleasure. It is a pleasure to all true Southern ladies to insult a Yankee soldier. But this was a happy turn for us. It kept them in the house until all the troops had gone.
               I hope the ladies will pardon me for this exposition of their weakness;—weakness, did I say? No it was not a weakness. It was a—what was it?—but no matter, the Yankees saw it. My purpose is to write a correct history, and I cannot therefore, overlook the very noble part our ladies played in all the important events connected with my subject. God bless the ladies, I say. They were our most faithful allies; our best recruiting agents; our best spies; our safest correspondents, during the whole period of the war. They filled up our wasted ranks until there were no more men to send; they gave us information of the enemy's movements; they cheered our lagging energies; they fed our scouts—these, and many more valuable services did they render in that holy struggle for Southern independence. Their influence was indeed powerful. Without it the war never could have been waged, and Secretary Seward would have been proven a good prophet.
               In a very few days Smithville was herself again; that is to say, the Yankee soldiers had all gone. That hated flag was insulting us no longer; the Provost Marshal's office was closed. We were again free from the smell of Yankee cook-houses, the noise of Yankee drums, and the sight of Yankee thieves—except the few carpet-baggers who still remained, but we could easily provide for their exodus, when we became full masters of the situation.
               We rejoiced at our good fortune. Our rejoicing was exceeding great. Our families met together and wept for joy. One hundred and fourteen Confederate flags were exhibited in Smithville that night—not publicly of course; we still had some sense left—but privately in parlors, when none but tried friends were present to look upon those sleeping emblems of a once flourishing and still living and revered cause. The cause is not lost. It only sleeps to recuperate its wasted strength. It is a living, moving, holy principle of constitutional liberty. It can never die in the heart of any lover of Southern rights.—Aye, the cause lives, and the gaping world will yet stare in wonder as the Confederate banner floats upon the breeze, and commands the admiration of mankind. Let us but be patient and teach our children properly.
               I said we rejoiced. So we did. Our noble ladies opened their wine closets, which had not been opened before for three years, and spread their tables with the choicest liquors. The gentlemen took their fine meerschaums and sacks of choice Turkish tobacco, and the best Havana cigars, and between the wine, the snuff and tobacco, the meetings were highly exhilerating and wonderfully perfumed. The young gentlemen and ladies, especially, were delighted and greatly entertained. Major Miller, poor fellow! as brave and gallant an officer as ever wore a plume, and who never shrank upon the field, nor feared the heart of the enemy's camp, was quite overcome by his emotional excitement, and his friends who were legion, were compelled to assist him to his room. The strain upon his nerves was too great, and yet he was a very cool man. The hour, the occasion, the circumstances, the surroundings; and more than all, the sight of that old flag which he had followed on so many fields of blood, was more than his high-strung, sensitive nature could calmly endure; and although he drank a great deal of good brandy, and smoked half a dozen or more of the very best cigars in the course of about two hours, in a determined effort to brace himself up to the requirements of the time, yet he was not equal to the demands made upon him, and as before stated, he gave way to his feelings. He was greatly excited. The ladies present said they had never seen him more so.
               Indeed it was a trying occasion, and none of us escaped the active contagion of the general impulse. We all had so much to talk about; so many memories to recall; so many stories of the war to tell; and then—saddest of all—so many names of dear ones lost to repeat and tell of their noble deeds, and praise their fondly cherished memories. These and such as these, gave us great reason for mingling our thoughts, feelings and prayers together. Much stimulus was required to nerve us up to the time.
               And our dear, good angelic ladies. I well remember how they circled round the old family tables, and after recalling in long lists the names of friends departed, and speaking in terms the most pathetic of their many virtues, their heroism, their sacrifices, their sufferings, their death, would, to drown their sorrow for a time, and ease the pains of memory, drink a glass or two of best Madeira, then, placing delicately and tenderly between their ruby lips, very appropriate quantities of highly flavored Scotch snuff, quietly distributing it around and about their pearly teeth with the most exquisite little brushes, gather round the ancient hearth and detail the horrors and villainies of the Yankee soldiery, while the great, wide fireplace so cheering, so venerable, served as a company spittoon. Ah, yes! sad, and yet joyful, was that long to be remembered night.
               The next morning, with some headache produced by the exacting torpor of the times, now that we were no longer cursed with the presence of the soldiery, we met together in the various counting houses and business offices in the town to consult about the best method of proceeding under the circumstances.—For it was our conviction that the safety of the country depended on our regaining power as soon as possible, and expelling these infamous Carpet-baggers.
               It had been our uniform habit, as before observed, in all public matters, to confine the direction of affairs to as few hands as possible. In accordance with this ancient and very proper custom, we concluded to hold a private meeting of a few of the most prominent and reliable citizens when we might arrange among our selves some practical and definite plan of action. If we could not rule our native State in war, we must do it in peace. The meeting was appointed for the next day at 3 P. M.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               
                  Conference among the leading citizens—Robertson county—Declaration of war against the Carpet-baggers—The plan of operations.
               
               General Doubleface, one of our most distinguished and representative men, who served his country faithfully, and honorably during the whole period of our late unhappy differences, was a lawyer by profession, and had very justly earned an enviable reputation at the bar of his native State. He was a gentleman of great versatility of talent, of splendid oratorical ability, and stood unequalled at the Smithville bar as a criminal lawyer. He had more clients, had acquitted more villains, stood higher for his ingenuity, could say more and mean less, than all our other attorneys combined. He had great influence over our juries, and especially those whose ability to decide according to the General's wishes was proportioned to their intelligence, and he never had any choice of means, except as they would insure success, to gain his end. He had unparalleled power of illumination. The darkest and most intricate propositions of that mysterious 
                     professian
                     profession
                  —the law, he could present to a jury in language so plain, so eloquent, so brilliant, and fascinating, that all their obscurity was lost in the blaze wrought up and made to sparkle as the noontide glare in a summer meadow, by the genius of his prolific imagination. The General has never been at a loss in any law point from Blackstone down to Wharton, except one, and that has frequently given him great annoyance. It seems that it has been overlooked by the lawmakers, or, which is, perhaps, the more probable reason, the judges have never correctly decided it. It is this: In Larceny, Arson, Burglary, Drunkenness, Seduction, and all that class of cases, the party accused, under our system of jurisprudence, is not permitted to plead se defendendo—self defence.
               For the benefit of the profession. I will here take the liberty of calling the attention of our lawmakers to this very important matter, and respectfully, but most earnestly request that some provision be made in the law, so that hereafter in all criminal prosecutions, the defendant be allowed to plead self defence or an alibi, and then be permitted to prove his plea. This would save a great deal of decomposition from heart burning, and a vast amount of destruction from broken and wasted constitutions; and besides this, on general principles of honor, whenever a gentleman feels himself insulted, or if an obnoxious individual happens from any cause to be in the way, he ought to be permitted either to shoot him, or hire some one else to do it. Such men have no proper right to live.
               In stature, the General was not so tall as to make him appear uncouth. No: he was disposed to be short. His shoulders were rather more round than square, and considerably stooped. But his chest was remarkably full and high—which accounts for the 
                     largenesss
                     largeness
                   of his heart and the quantity of his emotions, so that, although his back, if placed on an ordinary front, would have been 'humped,' yet as it was, his person always appeared erect, and it would not have made any great differences, except for personal convenience, which way his face had been turned. His head was very large, rather low, and flat on the top; his forehead very heavy, and hanging in massive proportions over two as bright, sparkling, little brown eyes as ever I looked at. His face was always mild, save when his brain was struggling with some ponderous thought; his countenance always wore a smile, except when he was pressing the claims for mercy of a client whose merits had been strangely overlooked for years, in allowing him to live.
               All in all, General Doubleface was a remarkable man. His great usefulness as a citizen and soldier was beyond computing. No matter what turn affairs took, he was always in the right place; yet, strange as it may appear to those metaphysical life fanciers who prate about consistency and all that, while he was always right, and never deceived either himself or his friends, he was rarely ever known to make the same proposition twice unless it would serve his purpose better than any other. His great objective point was success, nothing else, and every thing must bend to that. He was most liberal too, and entirely unselfish. I never knew him to demand or receive more than a client was able to pay or secure in any case. His fee was a mere pittance, say five hundred dollars in a case of Petit Larceny. And then, the easy turn of his mind made him a genial social, companionable gentleman every where. All classes welcomed him.
               
               In our troubled condition we found his services invaluable. His power of invention; his cool, secretive discretion; his ability to make himself 'all things to all men that he might by' any means secure the end in view; his unequalled power of deception, made him just the man we needed at this particular juncture of public affairs. We unfortunately were not home in time to participate in that extravagant farce commonly known as the reorganization of our State government, and we were, consequently, surrounded by some political disadvantages. We were disfranchised, very unjustly and illegally, it is true, but still such was the fact. The Carpet-baggers and our homemade radicals had possession of the state, and they were specially under the protection of the Yankee government. Hence, in order to regain our lost power, which was and is, our great object high above all others, the unquestioned ability of General Doubleface was of inestimable value to us. In the social field we were still masters, and intended to so remain, but in politics we were seriously embarrassed.
               There were other eminent gentlemen among us whose acknowledged talents, though of a different order, were brought into active operation at this time, and they proved very valuable auxilliaries indeed. Hon. Horatio Randolph, who was a lineal descendant of John Randolph of Virginia, was for many years a leading citizen of our State. The high appreciation our people had of his merits as a gentleman of high character, was frequently exhibited by their placing him in nomination for high and responsible offices. Being a brilliant orator, he always made a sparkling canvass, but because of the fact that his happy, mirthful temperament, and sterling social qualities, made him a great favorite in the domestic circle, the people always prefered to have him at home. For these reasons, he never filled an office that I now remember. He was a wise and prudent counsellor in our late unhappy differences. He was a tall, portly gentleman of superb appearance; an accomplished speaker, and the most highly honored of all the citizens of Smithville. His head was almost entirely bald. A few struggling gray hairs still hang around the lower and back part of his venerable head, and he wore a heavy, full 
                     beared
                     beard
                  , which was white and always clean and neatly combed. His eyes were black and luminous, his nose grecian and very long.—Mr. Randolph was valuable to us chiefly in imparting dignity to our proceedings.
               Col. Long, a very tall, slender gentleman with red hair, sharp features, compact, nervous frame, being also a lawyer, was our best adviser in all purely legal matters. He was well schooled in public law. In this department partment, he was greatly the superior of General Doubleface.
               Then there was Col. Stout, a gentleman of remarkable intellectual power, but his inclinations were rather political. He was cool, dispassionate, eloquent, sarcastic, secretive, ponderous. Physically, he was a man of wonderful proportions, weighing just three hundred and one pounds in his stocking feet, and measuring six feet two inches in his shirt sleeves. Mentally he was still greater. There can be no reasonable doubt that he would long ago have filled a prominent position in public life, but the cost of transportation—he always occupying all the seats near him—was a matter at all times of serious concern to him, and therefore he preferred a more secluded and less expensive life.
               There are many other honorable gentlemen in and around Smithville, whose names would adorn these pages, and some of whom will yet, doubtless, be introduced to the reader; but for all practical purposes, our present object could best be attained by a conference among them already named, who, with myself have for the last twenty-five years managed to control and direct the affairs of this section of our beloved state, and indeed exercised a large influence over all of Middle and West Tennessee. This was done on the principle of the committee system—always self-constituted of course—which has been noticed heretofore in these pages.
               There were in all, old and young, just forty lawyers in the city of Smithville. The number, as all will agree, was small for so large a place. We numbered at that time about three thousand souls. As is usual, these lawyers were all located near together. The street on which their offices were situated was familiarly known as 'Lawyer's Alley,' or 'Happy Row.'
               My lady readers, will, most likely, desire to know why this latter name was given to the place. On that subject I am really unable to make any satisfactory explanation, unless it be that there was so much money paid in there, and so little over paid out. And then, perhaps, I might venture the suggestion that lawyers, as a class are a very happy and contented people. They care but little for the misfortunes of their fellow men, because the law was made for the wicked and not for the righteous.
               The profession was built upon the disagreements, the quarrels and the crimes of mankind. They ought to be happy; they are happy; and it is to envy them their happiness, for it is seriously doubted by every convicted felon, and every defeated client, besides, by a great many other well meaning people, whether any of them (the lawyers) will ever be happy when they leave the lower courts and appear at the Bar above.
               
               We met in Happy Row in the back office of Gen. Doubleface to consult on the destinies of Smithville. As I had requested the meeting, it was reasonable as well as parliamentary, (we all understood parliamentary law) that I should state the object of the meeting, and give an outline of what was to be done. But before doing so, I directed my negro boy Bob—one of our old family niggers about fifty or sixty years of age—to supply us with a quart of good Robertson County and a box of cigars.
               My readers may not all know what I mean by "Robertson County." I will therefore explain before proceeding further. In Tennessee we have a county named Robertson whose good people are active philanthropists. A very large proportion of them are engaged in the manufacture and sale of an exhilerating beverage, somewhat stimulating—just enough for practical purposes—a kind of lubricating oil, yet not an oil, which is extensively used in Smithville and throughout Middle and West Tennessee. In East Tennessee they have an abundance of good living water, and there they rarely ever drink anything else as a general rule. This drink, as a stimulus or tonic, has very justly obtained a wide and enviable reputation. We much prefer it to Bourbon or even old Monongahela. I have seen its happy effects upon my neighbors in numberless cases of dyspepsia, headache, nervousness, debility, depression, uneasiness in the bowels, misery in the stomach, and indeed I may safely say, in all manner of cases where there was no immediate danger apprehended, and it has always worked charmingly.
               I am never without it myself, and my friend Gen. Doubleface is of opinion that much, if not all his success, is the result of his constant use of this valuable medicinal preparation. It has a delightful effect on the nervous energies of Col. Stout; and it greatly facilitates articulation in Col. Long, who has for many years been afflicted with a slowness of speech. We use it everywhere and for all manner of abilities and disabilities. We could not get along without it. Its use has become so general that it is now sold in every saloon in Smithville, and of these there are just thirty-nine. Our public speakers use it, our lawyers, our doctors, our ministers, our ladies, our children, everybody uses and loves this most delightful liquor, and we call it 'Robertson County' in honor of the good people who invented it, and yet were so considerate of human frailties as never to have applied for a patent. It kills but few.
               Bob returned with the articles ordered, and after imbibing freely of our favorite drink, lighting our cigars, and each throwing his feet upon the highest object he could find in the office, which happened to be the baize covered table on which the General did his confidential writing. I proceeded to say: 'Gentlemen, our situation, as you all are aware, is very alarming. We have just now finished up one war in which you all did well your part; but we are on the threshhold of another struggle of a very different nature, and yet, really, it is a part—a sequel of the other. We lost in that temporarily, but we must win in this, or our cause is hopelessly lost. It is not lost yet, but everything is in the hands of our enemies.' Here I was interrupted by Col. Stout who, after leisurely turning aside his head to blow out a blast of smoke from the corner of his mouth and spit at the buckle on Mr. Randolph's shoe, remarked: 'Everything is not in the hands of our enemies. The hearts of the Southern people are not yet in their hands.—Our convictions remain unchanged, and while our arms were conquered, our spirits never. Our children, in twenty years, will all be good soldiers.'
               He resumed his cigar, and I proceeded. 'The State is in the hands of our home traitors. [Here they all groaned and we filled our glasses again.] Three fourths of our people are disfranchised, and the whole State is being flooded with miserable adventures and place hunters from the North, who infest our ancient homes like so many vermin. These must be destroyed, and——'but I was suddenly interrupted by Col. Long who springing upon his feet, and throwing his half smoked and badly chewed cigar with great violence into the face of Col. Stout, while his chair tumbled backwards half across the room, said: 'Destroyed? Aye, they must be burned out by the quenchless fires of Southern hate of tyranny. Their craven hearts must be torn from their accursed bodies, and left scattered on the sacred soil their tread has made barren well nigh forever. No peace with me; no cessation of hostilities, until every thieving scoundrel of them has left his stinking carcass lifeless on the lands where he has slain, and stole, and burned until his infernal maw is full to bursting. My hand,'—and he brought it down with such force on the table as to displace Gen. Doubleface's glass, and to spill its contents into his (the Colonel's) hat, which had just fallen out of his other hand—'My hand is ready for the work now.'
               Randolph thought a little more Robertson would allay the Colonel's agitation, and we drank to 'Our future.' The Colonel resumed his chair, placing my hat very unceremoniously on his head, and biting the wrong end off a fresh cigar.
               
               'Right here in Smithville,' I resumed, 'these infernal creatures are hanging out their signs, opening up business offices, and strutting about the streets without appearing in the least degree to know or care that every hour of their stay is an hour of agony to us. And worse than this. Four hundred niggers are now going to school out here in this contraband camp, and five of these hideous creatures are teaching them. Four lawyers, one trader, two farmers, one preacher and five teachers here already, and our niggers under their control. Can we endure this?' 'No,' said Randolph. 'That then,' said I, 'is the work before us. Can we get rid of these hateful Carpet-baggers? If so, how?.'
               'That is the easiest thing in the world,' said Doubleface, filling up his glass again, and emptying it just below his manly mustache. 'The easiest thing in the world. No trouble about that;' and he called Bob, who was enjoying the occasion by appearing to sleep. Bob, as all well trained niggers do, intuitively understood what was wanted, and without further orders took up the empty bottle, opened the door, carefully placing his hat upside down on his head, and left the office.
               'I'll tell you how to get rid of these narrow-eyed creatures,' continued the General. 'They are just like all other men. They live either by their labor or their wits. A farmer must have land to work. Suppose these fellows can't lease, and they are too poor to buy land, they will soon leave. Suppose our people don't trade with Pettibone, he will soon dry up. His rents and insurance will soon eat up his little stock of wooden nutmegs and bamboo handkerchiefs. Suppose we don't allow any law business to go into the offices of their lawyers; their scrapings and stealings in the claim business wont keep up long, and then they must get out. Besides this we can instruct the people, who wont need much instruction on that point, to keep away from them. Don't go to their offices; don't associate with them under any circumstances; don't recognize them in church or on the streets, except only when decency absolutely requires it and there is no way of avoiding it; in short, have no intercourse with them whatever, further than what is necessary to cheat the government, and make the authorities believe we have accepted the results of the war in good faith. We must keep our eye single to that. In this way we can soon either smoke them out or make it too hot for them to live here. Their wives will then get homesick and fretful, and between their families on the one side, and the people on the other, we can manage them without any trouble at all. It is the 
                     eariest
                     easiest
                   thing in the world.'
               'What about the niggers?' I asked ed. 'What about them and the schools, and that lantern-jawed old——' but the door opened, and Bob, with his hat under his arm, came grinning in. It was observable that about two inches of vacant space appeared in the upper part of the bottle when that very ancient symbol of hilarity was placed in an erect position. But when interrogated on the subject, Bob, of course, knew nothing of the cause of this disgorgement as the doctors would call it, and that worthy individual remarked in reply to our inquiries: 'Ef ye don't bleve it, smell o' my bref.'.
               After refreshing ourselves again, for which purpose Col. Stout, who was perspiring profusely, had to be aroused from a mental abstraction into which the unusual importance of the occasion had forced him, and Bob directed to fan him with a folded copy of the New York Metropolitan Police Record. I inquired again: 'What about the niggers, General?'
               'Oh, that is a trifling matter,' said he. 'These strong minded ladies, calling themselves teachers, are paid by Yankee societies, christian commissions, freedmen's aid societies, etc. That mock patriotism will soon play out.' Here Col. Stout, having occasion to sneeze, threw his head a little too far back, and fell backwards off his chair, and rolled some feet across the floor. We assisted him to his place, and when, by fanning him, in which operation Mr. Randolph assisted by using the hat which Bob had for some time been using as a spittoon, and the copious use of the only stimulant we had at hand, we had succeeded in restoring him to his normal state. The General, after sending Bob for the Colonel's family carriage, proceeded: 'I said these schools are kept up by donations from the North. Now, the Yankees ain't fools. So long as they could make profits out of the war, they could afford to send money and missionaries down here to educate niggers, and that went to the world as 
                     philanthrophy
                     philanthropy
                   and christian benevolence. They beat us in that kind of game. But that proceeding will soon end now. The war is over, and if we are cautious, true to ourselves, and steer clear of breakers for a time, they will withdraw their supplies from these institutions, the bureau will be discontinued, and then, as the niggers can't pay them, and they wont work without pay, they will soon make tracks out of this, and we will have the niggers just where we want them. D'ye see?' said he, his bright little eyes twinkling as he threw about a gill of Robertson into Bob's face in an effort to hit that individual's open mouth, just as he entered the door.
               'And the parson, General, Rev. Mr.——. What do you call him, Major?' said Stout. 'Holmes,' I answered. 'Yes, Holmes. What do you propose to do with him?'
               
               'Oh,' replied Doubleface, 'when he finds the pastures are not as green as he anticipated, and when he learns that nigger preachers and their families will not be permitted to associate with decent people, and that in the white churches, he wont be tolerated, he will abandon his vineyard and look up a more congenial clime elsewhere. If this plan will not work, we can easily manage to kick up a row between him and his sable flock, when they will get rid of him themselves without our interferring at all.
               'And if that wont work,' said Col. Stout, 'we can burn out the whole thing in one night.'
               'That suits me,' remarked Randolph. 'But,' added the General, 'we all ain't out of the woods yet. We must go slow for a time. Here are Randolph, myself and Major Bantam, who are excepted out of the general provisions of the amnesty proclamation of May 29th. We are not pardoned yet.'
               'Damn the amnesty proclamation!' excitedly protested Col. Long. 'There never will be a man tried for treason. I'm in for burning up that cursed camp at once. We have a right, a lawful right to the control of our own niggers. I have no patience with such miserable proceedings.' And the Colonel emptied another glass very near his nose.
               'Right now is the turning point in our fate,' continued the General. 'I would go as far as any of you all, if it were safe. But we must be cautious—very cautious; it is a big work, and Uncle Sam is watching us like a hawk. We must wear two faces until we are out of danger. In three months Congress meets, and we must contrive to place a good appearance on the surface. That must be kept up until we get the government committed to some certain line of policy. Andy Johnson is on the right track now. Let us but put forward a meek front; that will give Johnson strength, and the Northern Democrats who always did our dirty work, and the moderate Republicans will soon take up our cause and advocate it for us. You know these doughfaces always came to our aid when we needed them, and they will do so again. They don't hate us. The great body of the Northern people think well of us, and will soon show it if we only do our part; that is, make them believe we are doing our part well enough to give them an argument in our favor. When the tide is once fairly set in, then we can begin our work here. Then, I don't care how many school houses and churches you burn. We can blame it on the Radicals and Carpet baggers, and the Copper-heads will swear by our word. But there is another very important matter which must receive our immediate attention just now, and here. We must contrive a plan by which we can induce one or more of these Carpet-baggers here, to take up our cause. If we can do that, which I believe we can, he will do us more good alone, than we can do ourselves combined for then we will have a voluntary defender whose voice will be heard, and whose influence will have weight.'
               Capital idea: capital, capital idea that,' said Randolph rising quickly to his feet as, half bent, holding both hands out of the way and pressing his knees backward, separating his very large feet, and at the same time performing a familiar operation with the muscles of his face, his tongue serving as a lever, displaced a quantity of the purest Virginia tobacco equal in size to an ordinary guinea egg. This very proper preliminary work having been satisfactorily and gracefully performed' he repeated: 'I say that's a capital idea, General. If we can get one yankee to take up our side, Smithville's safe. But how the devil are yon going to get the thing done? That's what pesters me.'
               'Leave that to me,' said the General, taking a sup out of my glass.
               'Aye,' said Stout; 'Leave that to Doubleface.'
               'If any man living can do it he can,' said Long, spitting at the end of Stout's coat tail which hung on the floor, and at the same time carefully taking from his mouth a very large mass of useless natural leaf and pitching the defunct quid into Bob's hat. 'By George!' added he: 'that idea is worth celebrating.' And he gave his head several distinct nods as he looked at each member of the company, particularly at the bottle on the table, towards which he straightway went smiling very knowingly. 'Let us drink to the General's Yankee friend.'
               And we did. Yes: we drank to the toast proposed by Col. Long in these words: 'The Yankee who takes the rebel's part: May his life be happy until we are done with him; then he and the devil for the rest.'
               We then drank to the health of General Doubleface for his gallant and ingenious proposition.
               Mr. Randolph then began: 'Now I have a matter to suggest. That hawk-eyed devil that's just come in with Hapsburg, can't stay here alive. That infernal scoundrel has insulted the good people of Tennessee, and particularly the people of Smithville too often to justify us in permitting him to live here.' 'Let me interrupt you a moment,' interposed Doubleface. 'Bob!'
               'Yes sah,' responded Bob.
               'Bob,' continued the General run down to Poole's and tell Billy Ward I want to see him in my back office. Be quick now: tell him to come in the back way; d'ye hear?'
               'Yes sah,' said Bob; and he left.
               'I was just saying,' then continued Mr. Randolph, 'that wretch cannot stay here. Of course it won't do for us to get up any excitement about it, for that might blow on us and put us a year back. But our people will not suffer him to insult and ride over them any more. We can endure the other puppies for a time, but that detestable villain we can't and won't tolerate. He ordered Jo. Jamison, one of our most valuable spies and scouts, to be shot for nothing else than notifying our troops where a batch of Yankees were encamped.'
               'Did you gobble the Yanks?' asked Stout.
               'Yes; Captain Pete Dawson, whom the brutes called a guerilla, captured the whole band, shot every devil of them and left them lying on the road.
               I say we can't tolerate this hideous fiend in our midst; but I am at a loss to know what is the best course to pursue.'
               'Can't some gentleman provoke a fight out of him and then shoot him in self-defence?' asked Long.
               'Aye, or notify him at once to quit the country?' added Randolph.
               'Will he fight?' asked Stout.
               At this point Bob entered the door.
               'Where is Billy?' asked the General.
               'He done started befo I come fum dar,' answered Bob who, looking back out of the window, added 'Dar he come; dat's him;' and in another moment Billy Ward quietly rapped at the door which being opened unto him, he stepped in. 'Did you want to see me?' he asked of the General.
               'Yes, I sent for you.' said the General. 'How is the money market to-day, Billy?'
               'Very tight,' replied Billy.
               'Bob, get another glass and let Billy taste something.'
               While Billy was tasting, the General took out his purse and counted twenty-five dollars which he handed to Billy, and said: 'There is a little change to relieve the pressure.'
               Billy took the bills and crammed them into the pocket of a very long, loose, many-colored vest.
               'Billy,' resumed the General, 'do you know this yankee here that they call General Short?' Billy said he did. 'Well now Billy, we don't like that fellow, and don't intend that he shall stay here long if there is any proper way to get rid of him.'
               'All right,' answered Billy; and with a knowing look he turned about, placed his hat on his head with both hands, fixing it firmly there, and bade us 'good evenin, genelmen.'
               This young man was a valuable aid to our cause in the war in conveying intelligence through the Yankee lines.
               Although he was inside their lines most of his time, they never discovered his treachery. They always suspected him, but never caught him in the act; and though he was frequently arrested, they never could prove him guilty. He was a young man, very diminutive in stature, weighing only about one hundred and twenty pounds. He was five feet five inches in height, wore very long shining black hair, and had as neat a little moustache and imperial as the most exquisite Vicksburg gambler. His face was feminine, mild, and set off by two jet black eyes.
               The case of Short being thus satisfactorily settled, I ventured that 'another matter gave me much concern. That fellow Hapsburg, about two months ago, presented to our minister a letter from the church to which he belonged in Ohio, setting forth that he and his wife were members in good standing, and commending them to our sympathies and prayers.
               They are regular in their attendance at our church every Sabbath, appear every way well behaved, and always take back seats, for none of us have ever recognized them or shown them to a pew. Two of their children, Emma and Charlie, attend the sabbath school every morning neatly and cleanly dressed. They are unusually bright children and always recite their lessons perfectly. Indeed they are not excelled in the school either for good behaviour or for perfect lessons by any children of the church. They are the most modest, shy little things I ever saw. We must speak to them and receive them into our classes, for you know the Sabbath school is a Christian institution; but we all hate them from our inmost hearts and don't permit our children to walk with them on the streets. They come and go alone. Their mother, I must say, is a very modest, well behaved, good looking woman. She dresses plainly, generally in black and never in silk. We are wonderfully disgusted at their sickening presence, but how is the thing to be remedied? That's the question.'
               'Don't associate with them; don't recognize them any where or under any circumstances; let them feel your contempt,' said Long who is also a member of our church.
               'We do all that now,' I replied; 'but this very day they have rented a pew and paid for it. Hapsburg is very anxious to be sociable.
               'Leave him to the men, and the women will take care of his wife and young ones,' said Doubleface
               'In four years we can smoke them all out,' coolly but emphatically came from the lips of Col. Stout.
               At this point the carriage drove up to the door. We all drank again, and General Doubleface remarked; 'We'll have a public meeting in a few days, when and where I will select a Yankee dirty-worker.'
               We helped Col. Stout into his carriage, and all left the office, while Bob stood on the top of the table holding the bottle in an inverted position with some two inches of the neck buried in a huge aperture in his face, and a strange, gurgling noise was heard in his throat.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               
                  Intimation to Gen. Short—McCarty's store—New characters—Grand Jury system—Force of public opinion—Chat with the Carpet-baggers.
               
               I was passing down street early next morning and saw Short and Hapsburg standing in front of their office with their backs to the street, looking very intently on some object,—what, I did not know. Turning the first corner, I saw Bill Ward standing behind a pile of store boxes, looking through a knot hole toward the Yankee lawyers. I asked him what he was doing. He said in a very serious tone 'some low-down fellow has daubed black paint all over Gen. Shorts name on the firm sign.'
               I then went on to Tom McCarty's store and looked through the blinds of his back windows at the manouveres of the bewildered Yanks. They quietly opened the door, brought out a hatchet, unfastened the sign, and Short took it away, to the paint shop as I afterwards learned.—Hapsburg went into his office and quietly got to work, while his own little shingle creaked on its hinges at the door.
               I left my look-out, saying to McCarty as I took a seat, 'what cool, patient people these Yankees are. I wonder if they were made for any good purpose.'
               A number of our most respectable citizens soon collected in the store. This is another custom of ours. We have regular places of meeting to pass about the news and to gather up fresh intelligence. In these social gatherings, we confer with each other, and mould public opinion. We keep up a kind of grand jury system, without any 
                     necesity
                     necessity
                   for special instructions from the court as to our duties. In this way we keep ourselves posted about our neighbors affairs, and things generally. We thus exercise a kind of inquisitorial power over the people. We always know what is going on in the community, and can quickly devise means to push proper persons forward, and improper persons homewards. We act in concert, and hence with great power.
               This system—already adverted to—has been found to work well in practice. We are always advised of our exact condition, and in case any emergency arises suddenly, we can speedily devise a remedy, and adopt a plan of action without making any noise about it; and no matter what our action may be, it has the appearance of a spontaneous work, having in it all the elements of propriety and wisdom. It relieves us also of the necessity of calling the whole people together for consultation. A few of us in this way can manage the public business of the city and surrounding counties, and the common people know nothing but to say—'It is all right."
               This keeps the people quiet, for they have nothing then to do, but to go along with their business-their every day work. They feel that their interests are in good hands, and well guarded. This system of public supervision has been found very efficient too in building up or breaking down a man's business or character. When we want to destroy a man's prospects, all we have to do is, for a few of those who can be trusted to get together at McCarty's, and set afloat the necessary 
                     rumous
                     rumours
                  . No matter how good he may be, or what his calling, we can break him up in a month. Public 
                     oppinion's
                     opinion's
                   easily manufactured when you have the right kind of material and suitable tools.
               Mr. Zedekiah Jones was the first who called upon myself. This Mr. Jones, one of most worthy citizens, was born in New York. He came to Tennessee when quite a young man, and hired himself to old Uncle Sam. Franklin as an overseer. Uncle Sam had eighty or a hundred hands, and Jones managed them well. He got a third more work out of them than any other man had ever done. That has been our universal experience. If we could get a Yankee overseer, we always had more and better work done with our niggers. They were all democrats of course, and hence had no scruples on the score of humanity to niggers.
               Jones was a tall, fine looking fellow and soon married into the old man's family, and set up for himself with a good farm, and three families of good, sound niggers. He worked them too hard, and they often complained to their old master, but that only made it worse for them.
               Now Jones was a fine talker. He thought he had the best and loudest voice in America. He was also very accommodating in his disposition, and always said the Southern people were the best in the world. On any occasion, where there was a great deal of hard and uncomfortable ble work to be done, Jones was our man. He would ride all day in the hottest sun as Marshall, or Messenger, or aid, and although nearly fainting in the heat, would swear he never felt better in his life. In many instances he had served our purposes well, and for much that we had for him to do, no man could have done better.
               After Jones, next came in James Black, a little, chubby, fat man from the upper end of the county, a large and influential farmer. Then came Jake Prim, the miller. Prim was a good fellow, but his great fault was, his habit of talking too much. Besides this he used a great deal of profane language. He never told what was said, or who said it in these gatherings, but when a little excited he was apt to blow the substance of our conversations, and proclaim the conclusions to which we arrived. He was a man of about fifty years, was small in stature and thin, with a sharp face, in which set two very deep blue eyes. Of course he wore a white hat; all millers do. He was once a great fighter in our town, but he got badly worsted on one particular occasion by a Yankee show-bill poster, since which time he will not fight.
               These gentlemen, and a few others were present. We talked over the sign-painting business for some time, and then started to Poole's Saloon to take a little Robertson. On our way to that favorite resort, we saw Short nailing up his sign. His name appeared as bright as ever. After drinking, Jones went directly over to their office, and the rest of us went back to McCarty's
               He told them that he had heard of the unfortunate occurrence of the previous night, that he had just been conferring with a great many of the most reliable and responsible citizens of the place, all of whom, without exception, condemned the cowardly act. The citizens of Smithville, he said, were a noble, generous people. He was a Northern man, and a Union man. They had always treated him with great respect. He knew them well, and therefore could vouch for their sincerity in this matter. He had married here, raised his family here, and he knew what he said, when he declared that the good, responsible people unanimously disapproved such low-down behavior. They did not endorse it. He assured the gentlemen of this. It was done by some low-flung, irresponsible fellow who had nothing else to do. Or, indeed, it might have been done by some young gentlemen who were out in search of a little fun, and who might have been betrayed into this breach of propriety. At all events, the responsible people deplored the act.
               This conversation he reported when he returned to McCarty's. He said the lawyers believed all he said, and expressed a desire to so demean themselves as to merit the respect of all the citizens.
               Mr. Black then went on the same errand, and in about half an hour afterward returned, apparently disappointed at the 'very cordial and gentlemanly manner'—to use his own words in which they received him. He repeated the substance of what Jones had said, and remarked to us they seemed to believe all he said.
               We next sent Jake Prim on the same errand, and we separated. That evening I saw Jake again in Col. Long's office. He said he gave them d—d Yankees h—ll.'
               I cautioned him to beware of imprudence, as we were in a very critical state just now. He replied:
               'I only told them there was a feeling here like a volcano toward 'em, and they'd have to behave themselves d—d well, or they couldn't stay here long.'
               I was vexed at him, and told him she was a fool. If he didn't keep his mouth shut, we would have a pack of dutch Yankees here in less than a week.
               Uncle Jake, as we frequently called him, was an inveterate smoker, and was not often seen without his pipe in his mouth. He had been leisurely filling up his old clay pipe during this conversation, and walking away from the wall at which he sat to light his match on the wall at the opposite side of the room, he gave it a very long and hard rub. After repeating this operation several times with as many different matches, we held the fire to the bowl of the pipe between his hands in such manner as to prevent the wind from blowing it out, although there was not a particle of wind blowing, and with a kind of relief grunt familiar to all who have ever seen Jake put on the finishing touches of lighting his pipe, he resumed his seat.
               I asked him if he had said nothing more.
               'Yes:' he said, puffing away at his pipe while the back of his right thumb was arranging the fire and tobacco: 'Yes: I told them our people hated them all as they did rattlesnakes, and would not tolerate them no how, only that the war was over, and we had accepted the results in good faith, and we wanted immigration now that the niggers was all free; and if they'd behave well, we'd try and stomach them awhile any how, and he gave a few more puffs at his pipe, making great hollows in his cheeks like inverted tea-saucers. 'Yes:' he continued: 'I told them all that, and then I told them I knew very well our responsible citizens deplored the act, that some low-down, irresponsible fool had done it, and I hoped it would not be done any more.'
               
               So saying, placing one hand over the bowl of his pipe to prevent the wind from blowing the fire out, he pulled his hat very tight down over his head, and walked out.
               Although I had never known Jake to do us any intentional mischief, yet his volubility, his want of concentration, his entire ignorance of all deceptive arts, and then his profanity, frequently made it necessary for us to wipe out his footprints. I conferred with Col. Long on the propriety of my calling on the Yankees myself, and setting things right if any harm had been done. The Colonel approved my suggestion, remarking that he was glad there was one man in Smithville who would undertake so unpleasant a work. For his part, he never intended to apologize for anything that ever had been, or ever would be, done to a Yankee. He looked upon them, each and all, as his personal enemies, whether in peace or in war, and would never dirty his hands with them. He looked upon their punishment and detestation as a christian duty which he expected to perform. He hated them and was teaching his children to hate them. But the Colonel was getting excited, and a client happening in just then, I retired to go on my unpleasant errand. It was unpleasant for more reasons than one, but chiefly because I felt it to be an errand of hypocrisy, deception and cheat.—Those men, as much as I hated them, had done me no wrong. I hated them with all the power God had given me, and that I could have told them cheerfully. But while I despised and loathed them, I was to tell them any thing else than that. And then it was unpleasant because I did not wish to be seen in their company, for no one, save a very few, would know my business. But I went.
               They both rose from their seats and politely received me, each offering me his hand, which of course I had to shake. They said they 'were glad to see me, and hoped more of the people would call on them.'—Hapsburg handed me a seat, and they both sat near and facing me.
               I stated to them that I had been informed my old friend Prim had been in their office, and had not been as discreet as he should have been. They both smiled, and Hapsburg remarked that they had not paid much attention to what he said. 'Two other gentlemen,' he said, 'called on us this morning and expressed serious regrets at the occurrence of last night. Mr. Prim seems to be an honest, good sort of an old gentleman, fond of talk, and we were disposed to take the more charitable view of his case, and think that he says more than he means, perhaps.'
               That relieve me greatly, and I took advantage of the favorable turn things had taken. I said: 'Then, gentlemen, you are satisfied our good people do not approve the unfortunate affair about the sign?'
               Hapsburg answered: 'We have been assured that such is the case by apparently responsible gentlemen, and we have no disposition to say we do not believe them.' I then added: 'Our late unhappy differences have thrown many obstacles in the way of an immediate healing of all our sores; but by proper forbearance on the part of each, we may, and can, restore harmony to our distracted country. We intend to do our part in the good work.'
               'I am truly pleased,' said Short, 'to hear you so express yourself. We do not expect your people to love or admire us, or even to desire our presence here. We know and fully appreciate your misfortunes, and could not therefore reasonably expect that you would welcome us with open arms; but we claim the right to locate anywhere we please in the United States, and prosecute a legitimate business. We have selected this as a business point, and expect peacefully to follow our calling. We only ask to be treated with common decency and justice. We think we understand what is proper between gentlemen in the courtesies of cultivated life, and we intend to behave ourselves so well as, sooner or later, to inspire our neighbors with at least a favorable degree of confidence. We stand on this side of the past, and are ready to forget its memories, so far as calling them up to you is concerned. You have nothing to fear from us. If we are well received, and a spirit of encouragement to immigration from the North is manifested by your people, in two years we can add five hundred persons to the population of your county, and they will be energetic, working, intelligent people.'
               'Are there many persons in the North who desire to come South to reside?' I asked.
               'Thousands of them,' replied Hapsburg, 'and they would come prepared to make themselves useful to the country.'
               I shuddered. 'Do they intend coming soon?' I asked.
               'No,' said Short. 'They are now sending out pioneers like Hapsburg and myself, to feel if the way is clear, and whether the Southern people will receive us. We are making an experiment for the benefit of all.'
               I felt better. 'How long do you propose to remain?' I asked.
               'All our lives, if the people are willing,' said Short. We love your climate, and there is much in the country which is attractive. We only ask you to give us a fair trial, and then, if you desire more of our kind, we can command them.'
               We certainly have no such desires, I thought, but was in a very bad place to say so.
               
               'Have you good schools?' asked Hapsburg. 'We Yankees are great friends of good public schools.'
               'Well, yes,' I replied. 'We had schools before the war.' I saw Short was going to say something more, and as I was in a very unenviable position, I hastily arose, saying that I had merely called to assure them the good people of the city deplored the affair of last night, and desired them to understand distinctly, that the citizens wished them no harm. If any similar occurrence happened again, they should feel that it was the work of some low-down, irresponsible fellow who cared nothing for the peace of society; and I was just about to retire when both arose and extended their hands again, hoping I would repeat my call, etc.—While I was undergoing the torment of hand-shaking, I observed a hatchet and saw lying in the corner. I asked had those tools been left there by the carpenters, or whether the niggers had left them, for I had lost some tools out of my barn.
               'No;' replied Short, 'we had some little repairs to make about the office, and as we are both fond of manual exercise, and not any too flush in the way of money, we thought we would do it ourselves. Those are the tools we use.'
               He was shaking my hand while making this last remark, and in thinking about the tools, and lawyers doing carpenter work. I momentarily forgot my place, and asked them to go to Poole's and drink with me. But to my great relief, they both politely declined, saying they used whisky just as they did arsenic: took it only when it was the best thing they could get for the case in hand.
               I never was more relieved in my life, for I could not, under any circumstances, have been seen drinking with a Yankee. I intended to go straightway home, for I felt that I had done a mean thing. I had never received more polite attention, and yet I had never told any two men more egregious lies, or tried harden to deceive. I heartily wished the devil had all the Yankees, and I would not have cared much where I was. I started homeward as fast as I could walk without attracting too much attention, but at the very first corner, I met Billy Ward, who said I was wanted immediately at 
                     McCarty'e
                     McCarty's
                  . I told him to go to the devil, I was going home. I am well satisfied that Billy did not understand me, although he said he was 'on the road there now,' which I thought likely. He insisted on my going, but I was resolute and did not change my gait or course.
               I continued rapidly homeward, and as I was passing the widow McFlimsey's residence I heard my wife's voice calling me through the opening ing door. In another moment I was confronted with: 'Major Dick Bascom, you have been seen by at least one hundred persons going in and sitting and talking with them miserable, nasty, stinking Yankees. Oh, you needn't cough, and squirm, and turn red, I saw you this very minute with my very, eyes coming out of their dirty hole. Mrs. McFlimsey and me was a watching you through the blinds of that window, and we know it all. Now, you go right back to McCarty's, and apologize to our people for your mean conduct, or don't never come back to my house again. Now go right along, and don't be standin here like a fool. I don't want the people of Smithville to think that Major Bascom is associatin with Yankees:' and I was very unceremoniously shown down the street again.
               There was that young scoundrel Ward still standing at the corner laughing at me. I could have thrown him into a pit fifteen miles deep if the earth had been good enough to open for my benefit, and I would about as soon have 'gone tumbling after him' as anything else I could then think of. I saw no possible way of dodging my fate. To McCarty's I had to go. My wife willed, and she owned the property: that was enough, and I proceeded in any thing but an enviable temper.
               As is usual when a man is in trouble, my head was not so erect as it had been on the occasion of mustering the first regimens of Tennessee troops in 1861, and I must confess to some abstraction of mind. I had dropped my cane somewhere, and both my hands were immersed in my coat pockets. When crossing Mulberry street in full view of about fifty men at McCarty's who were awaiting my arrival, I heard a voice just behind me, and at the same time a slap came from a very heavy hand on my shoulder. This startled me and I suddenly jerked both hands from my pockets, and with my right came a handkerchief, and with the handkerchief a pack of cards.
               'Why, Major Bascom,' said the ruffian, I am truly very glad to see you. How are Mrs. Bascom and the family generally?' shaking my hand the while, and I scarcely knowing whether it was best to knock him down or not.
               'Come,' said he, 'go with me down and we'll call on Gen. Short and Captain Hapsburg. They are two gentlemen who have come here from the North, and we must show them some true Southern gentility. Come, come along,' and the wretch was tugging, and pulling away at my arm as though I was some stubborn boy of nine.
               I most resolutely planted myself firmly on the solid stone street and pulled back. 'No, no, I cannot go just now. At some future time when less engaged, I will take great pleasure ure in——that is; really, Judge Pinchbeck, no; I have business of pressing importance in quite another direction which imperatively demands my immediate personal presence. On another occasion, I may; I will; that is; no, I can't go now.' But before I could convince the staring fool who was looking at me in great astonishment, that my attention was required elsewhere, to my still greater mortification and discomfiture, there were Short and Hapsburg both right by us on their way home.
               They both knew Judge Pinchbeck, and while one was shaking his hand, the other was wriggling mine, and all this in sight of the crowd at McCarty's. But I was relieved on seeing the most of them go in when the Yankees appeared. I knew they could not all see us through two windows. The Yankees invited us home with them to tea, but to my great relief, the Judge had but a moment to spend with them, and would just say to them right there and then what was on his mind, and would not detain them longer. He said he had been enjoying a large and lucrative practice in Smithville and surrounding counties, but now that he was on the bench, he would turn over all his unfinished business to them, which would doubtless be of value to them in the beginning of their practice. They thanked him, shook hands with both of us again, and left us. I was glad to find the Judge was not going to McCarty's.
               I nerved myself up to the occasion as well as I could. Reader, you may not know that such an occasion requires courage. If you have never passed through such an ordeal, you can have no proper conception of its horrors. I had rather face a regiment of armed Yankees on the battlefield, when passion gleamed on every bayonet, and blood was dripping from every saber, than to march up in front of that indignant crowd of my neighbors.
               The force of organized public opinion is greater than that of armies with banners. I then felt what we had made many another poor fellow feel oftentimes before. About fifty of my warmest friends—so I always knew them to be—looking on me with withering scorn and contempt, while a medley of excited and angry voices were pouring out upon my innocent head in apparently careless volleys, their utter horror and detestation of such 'double-dealing, such hypocrisy, such treachery,' and many other similar expressions, which fell upon my ears like the imprecations of so many cannibals in whose power I might have been placed.
               I vainly tried to expostulate, to explain, to apologize, to retract, to——anything they desired; but not a word would they hear. They would not listen to my 'false tales.' They had seen me shaking hands with the scoundrels on the streets. They had seen me talking to them for half an hour in their office, and standing with them at the door. They had heard me asking them to drink with me, and then trying to slink off home, thinking no one had been looking on. They had seen my noble-hearted wife meet me and send me back. Yes, they had seen all, and if I wanted to retain my position in society, that should be the last of my intercourse with murderers and cut-throats.
               When they had finished my case, they told me to go home to the family I had dishonored, pray God to forgive my meanness, and get up tomorrow morning a wiser and better man. That advice I took, and distance between me and McCarty's grew greater about as fast as it had ever done before, feeling an innate consciousness that old Jake Prim's tongue was to blame for it all, and the very first thing I asked the Lord in my prayers that night to do, was to take that old villain away from here.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               
                  Good reading—The sick woman—Carpet-bag charity—Buttermilk—Old clothes—Bob and his Spelling book.
               
               My rest was not as pleasant that night as I have known it to be at many other times. After breakfasting, which I did very lightly, as I had a misery in my stomach, and was otherwise ailing, I repaired to the library that I might find consolation in reading. I cleaned up my eye glasses and picked up the Bible. (I was always fond of reading the Scriptures.) Now it has been my uniform habit, when I read that good book, to begin just where my eye first meets a passage. The first verse which I read was "The way of the transgresser is hard." Yes, thought, that's so. I opened the book at another place and there read "Love ye one another.', That was not just what I wished to see at that particular time, and I opened the book at still another place. I read the 12th, and as for as the first clause of the 3d verse of the 13th chapter of Romans. I was satisfied that was not the book for me under the circumstances, and I laid it away.
               The New York Day Book was lying on the table, and my eye rested on an article headed "The wrongs of the South." That suited the peculiar condition of my mind much better. I could not help wondering how those constitutional Democrats of the North, who were never down here at all, could know so much 
                     of of
                     of
                   our real situation. But they are fearfully and wonderfully made those northern people, especially the Democrats. The only thing I ever found fault with them for was, that after we had got into a war partly by their advice, they never lifted a hand to help us out. But then I suppose they had enough to do at home in protecting their property and families from the rapacity of the Lincolnites.
               I was reading about "
                     Miltary
                     Military
                   Arrests," "Crushing Despotism, Unparallelled Brutality," "American Barbarism," etc., and was beginning to be myself again when I heard the door-bell ring. One of the servants brought me a card just as Mrs. Bascom walked into the room. I read it: "Charles Hapsburg, Smithville Tenn." Mrs. Bascom looked over my shoulder as I read. 'Don't you let that nasty thing come in here,' she said, and called out 'Oh, Betty!' Betty, who was one of our old family servants, soon appeared.
               'Go and tell that greasy Yankee that Major Bascom is not at home.'
               'No,' said I, 'that will not do, for he saw me as he came up the walk. He could not have avoided, seeing me if he looked this way at all.'
               'Well then he saw you,' she said; for thear eyes are everywhere. Go and tell him then that Major Bascom has company and can't see him.'
               'Hadn't I better go and see what he wants, my love,' I asked. 'You see we must act very prudently just now, not arouse suspicion. We must make these fellows believe we intend to treat them well until we get things into our own hands again.'
               'I don't see how you can talk to them dirty, greasy Yankees,' she said pettishly, and added, 'He shan't get in here while I am the owner of this house.' As she said this she began to feel in her pockets for the keys. It is the habit of our good ladies to carry the keys of the chests, drawers and doors of the house about with them. We have so many niggers all around us, and they will steal.
               I walked out into the hall and to the outer door. As I left the parlor I heard the click of the lock behind me. There was Hapsburg waiting, but of course I did not invite him in. No; we stood on the portico while we talked. We never do invite any of them into our houses, and unless some supernatural power comes within our lines, we will never alter our habit in this respect.
               When I say 'We,' I mean to be understood as using the word according to the southern acceptation of its meaning: That is to say, the leading men; the men who have control of the public mind. They constitute 'We' in the South. I repeat: We don't invite Yankees into our houses. The poor whites through the country, and occasionally a low-down fellow in the towns,—here and there one, will permit, aye indeed, sometimes invite; yes, invite them into their houses and eat with them. But this is not at all a common thing; and We never do, unless they are commanding troops. We are a politic people.
               'Major Bascom,' said the visitor, there is a lady residing just across the street who is in very needy circumstances, and is very sick besides. I happened to meet her during the war when I was on duty here. She was good enough to permit me to take my meals at her house. She treated me very kindly, and I am sorry to find her situation so bad. She is in a suffering condition, and informs me she has not been able to leave her room for several months. I have called to confer with you as to the best means of affording her some relief. She informs me that she has relatives in the city, and I would thank you to accompany me to them. You are doubtless aware of the case, and could be of great service, being a leading and influential citizen, in having the poor woman in some way relieved of her pressing penury.
               'I've got nothing in the world to do with the woman,' said I.
               'Will you be good enough, then, said he, 'to direct me to the residence of Mr. Morton, who, I learn, is an uncle of the lady?'
               'Mr. Morton lives on Walnut street,,' I replied, and he bowed himself off the portico.
               As he was going out of the gate, he met a little white haired girl coming in. He took her little dirty hands in his and asked, 'how is your mother this morning?'
               'No better,' the little thing answered, and she came up to where I was standing.
               'Major Bascom,' she shyly said, 'Ma sent me over for a little butter milk. She thinks it would do her good. She hasn't eat anything for three days.'
               'How much does she want?' I asked.
               'Oh, just whatever you will give her,' she replied.
               'Give her?' I asked. 'Didn't she send any money along? We sell our butter milk.'
               'No sir;' we are so poor; we havn't any money only what Captain Hapsburg gave us, and that's all gone.'
               'Well, go back to the kitchen,' said I. 'and tell Betty to give you a pint,' and I returned to the parlor, which had been unlocked for my benefit. In a moment Betty appeared at the door, and addressing me, said:
               'Please sir, we've jis got two gallons o' butter milk and dat's all done sold.'
               'Well, give her a little, at any rate,' said I.
               'Yes, sah, but it's all done gone; done took off. But we's gwine to churn agin in de mornin,' she added, when I told her to save a little for Mrs. Hammond.
               Taking up my hat, I started to go down to McCarty's. On the way I met Bob coming rapidly up the street with some little brown paper bundles. I asked him what he was carrying and where he was going.
               'Got some little things for Mis Hammond,' replied Bob.
               'Where did you get, them?' I asked.
               'Cap'n Hapsburg guv em to me.'
               'Where is Captain Hapsburg?
               'Done gone ober to Mars Billy Morton's,' said Bob.
               I passed on to McCarty's. The first man I met there was Mr Morton ton, who was almost out of breath. He had evidently been walking very rapidly. I asked him if he had seen the Yankee lawyer.
               'Yes, said he,' I saw him coming up the lawn towards my house, and I hurried out the backway, so as to avoid him.'
               I then reported the interview I had with him, and added, that it was my intention to find out what made him so much interested in Mrs. Hammond. We accordingly went back to McCarty's back window, where we could see into the Yankee office, and waited for Hapsburg to return. He soon came and opened up his desk. There were about a dozen persons—our country citizens—in the office, having claims against the government for horses, mules, corn, fodder, pigs, chickens, geese, milk, butter, etc., which the 
                     Yackees
                     Yankees
                   had stolen.
               Congress had agreed to pay all 'loyal' men for such losses, provided the army got and used them for the benefit of the Lincoln government. Now, in our county there were just live original Union men in 1861.—They were the only men in the county who persisted in their Unionism. We hanged one of them, drove two out of the State, and frightened the others into silence. If the act of Congress were literally construed and justly administered, these would be the only men in the county of Middleburg who would be entitled to consideration in an application to the government for pay for property taken and used by the army. But at the time of which I write, there were many Union men—native Union men—who could take the required oaths as easily as they could a glass of Robertson.
               Our people are an honest, upright, christian people, and are very conscientious on the matter of taking oaths. They were compelled to take a great many very distasteful ones while the Yankee army was here, but now they were at liberty to consult their own consciences, and so they did. I had been watching the office of these Yankee lawyers, all my leisure time for two months—ever since they had opened one indeed—and have a memorandum of two hundred and fifty of our country people who have been there to file claims. I often wondered how they managed to swear to suit the case, and was thinking of that very thing when I saw Sam Hippenhammer coming out of the office looking very pleasantly indeed. Of course he came over to McCarty's. I at once asked him how he could take that oath—adding that he knew very well he had furnished two loads of bacon, and twenty-five barrels of flour, besides some jeans, to Captain Jerrymander's company of Confederate troops.
               
               'Ah,' said he, 'you see, Major, that oath only requires us to swear that we were 'loyal' at the time the property was taken and have been ever since. I have never done nothing since the bacon matter, you know.'
               'But, had you taken the oath of allegiance to the Yankee government at that time?' I asked.
               'Ah, yes: I done taken that, and there hasn't been nary other one since that I didn't take. Oaths were as thick as oats gnats here awhile, and, I've done tuck em all.'
               'Now, Sam,' I asked! 'Do you pretend to say you are loyal to the government of the United States?' Do you love that government?'
               'No;' quickly responded he. 'D—n the Yankee government, I hate it You might as well try to poke butter into a wildcat with a hot awl, as to poke Yankee into me.'
               'Then, how can you take that oath?' again I asked.
               'D—n the oath,' he replied; 'it ain't bindin, no how; it's unconstitutional and void, and then I want pay for my property. It's the green backs I'am after. I ain't carin nothin about the oath. I have got used to 'em.'
               The legal proposition which he stated, was all that had ever given me any relief in the matter. Sam took the legal view of it, and having some law knowledge, I say he was quite correct. The oath was not binding whether it was constitutional or not, and this was the view our people took. The lawyers all so advised them.
               'But how about the fees?' I asked. 'How do you pay your lawyers?'
               'We pay the expenses of getting up the claim,' said he, 'and they take their pay out of the collections.'
               'Do you expect to get anything?' I again asked.
               'Why them fellows say if the government is satisfied with our loilty, we'll be paid.'
               Aye, thought I, there's the rub. Loyalty! Loyalty! If that's the standard, there is not much money coming into the county from the United States government; and I so intimated to Mr. Hippenhammer.
               'Well,' said he, 'taking up his saddle pockets and walking out, 'we'll be loyal till we see whether we get anything, anyhow.'
               I saw Hapsburg was still busy, and more claimants coming, and I started to Mrs. Hammond's, going by Poole's to take some refreshments. Now, this woman was the wife of an unfortunate merchant in our city, who before the war, became embarrassed in his business matters, and using rather too much stimulus, he died in '61 from over excitement. He stood very high among our people. He had a beautiful little home, and some ten or a dozen likely niggers. But he died. His estate was insolvent. Nothing was left.
               When the Yankees came, his widow, to support herself, opened a boarding house, and took in Yankee officers and clerks to board. Quite a number of other very respectable families were under the necessity of doing the same thing. There was Mrs. Flimsey, whose daughter married the Yankee clerk. She, too, and others I might name, took boarders, to make a livelihood. But there was this difference between their cases. While Mrs. McFlimsy and others boarded the Yankees, they always stood up for the South, while Mrs. Hammond plead for the Lincolnites. And that's a serious difference in Smithville. The other ladies are all still highly respected, but she was despised by all the people of the city. I found the fencing around the premises all destroyed, and the town pigs rooting up what was once the most beautiful floral garden in the city. Mrs. Hammond once sold a great many flowers from that little spot of ground, but it is all destroyed now. I found her in bed, one of the most perfect pictures of despair and wretchedness that it was ever my misfortune to look at. She reached her hand to me and said:
               'My poor children, what is to become of them? God have mercy upon them, I can do nothing but give them to him. I am dying.'
               'Is there anything I can do for you?' I asked.
               'Nothing now,' she faintly said. You could have saved are a few months ago, but it is too late now. Oh! my poor children. God take them.' And she turned herself as though some excruciating pain was darting through her whole body.
               'Have not the neighbors done anything to relieve you?'
               'Nothing,' she said, 'save Mrs. Dr. Hartshorn. She has been kind to me. And then the Northern people here have helped me some. My children had starved, I do think, if Captain Hapsburg had not been so good to them. He comes to see me often, and always brings something either for them or me. Only last week he sent up flour, tea, sugar and ham, and this morning again, he sent more. He is such a good, kind man. May God reward him; I can't;' and she seemed to sleep.
               I left the room. I did not feel comfortable there. Everything was not as it should be. That woman was a native Tennesseean, and we ought not to see her suffer, even if she did feed the Yankees. She was compelled, just as others were, to take that course. But then she said she was always a Union woman. That was the trouble, But no matter, she was destitute, and her children starving.
               
               Such thoughts as these came into my mind, and I felt hurt; yes, I felt really sorry for the poor thing. I did; a fact.
               'I went right home,' and asked Mrs. Bascom and the girls if they hadn't some old clothes they could spare for those poor children. (There were five of them.) But, noble creatures, they said they 'never had anything to do with the Yankees, and never would have, with them, or with any one that ever did, or ever would plead their cause! and besides,' said Sue, my oldest daughter, 'Pa, you know well enough we always sell our old clothes to the niggers.'
               I then walked out into the garden, under the grape arbor, and called Bob. He came.
               Said I, 'Bob, are you as true to me as ever?'
               'Yes, Marse Dick; I hasn't gin ye up yit. Bob's Bob. Mind dat.'
               'Well, then, Bob, take this money' and get some other nigger to buy some calico, domestic, and some flour, coffee, tea, sugar and a good ham, and have it all taken to Mrs. Hammond's house. Be quick, and don't let anybody know whose money it is. Be quick now, d'ye hear?'
               'Bob's head's clear,' said he, and he left me.
               Bob has been a good, faithful servant. He never deceived me. He was getting some queer notions in his head recently, but I had not yet caught him in any forbidden act, save conning over his Yankee spelling book. He was beginning to read a little, and often when I wanted him, I had to call him away from that confounded blue book. He loved it as well as he did his hymn book, which he never could read.
               It is an astonishing fact that with all the demoralization and crime of the war, and notwithstanding that these stupid creatures had been slaves for the past two hundred years, and the widespread illumination made in the land by the camp-fires of a world of soldiers gave them abundant opportunities for insurrection, revolt and murder, their naturally docile habits remained with them, and their accustomed obedience, as well as their reverential attachment for their old masters never forsook them. In all matters of social and domestic life, they still remain our true friends, and it would seem that no amount of persecution on our part could drive them to revolution, but there is a something connected with the war: a silent, incomprehensible, intangible shadow of a misunderstood substance that works terrible havoc in their thoughts With their freedom, (which I am quite certain they neither understand nor know how to enjoy,) they imagine all sorts of fanciful responsibilities and duties suddenly resting upon them which they are in some way bound to discharge. For instance, they believe they must appear as much as possible like white people in their manners and habits; they must learn to read; they must start their children to school; they must know something of the policy of the State and General government; they must practice arts of mechanism, etc., but with all these new ideas—rendering them every day less fit for the duties of servants—they love the land of their birth, and I doubt seriously whether they will ever forget their christian education.
               Now Bob was a very intelligent shrewd old nigger. He had been born and raised in my father's family. He and I were boys together, and have grown up to mature years the same sociable, companionable pair. He has an almost superhuman attachment for me and my family, and while he will study his spelling book and talk strange things to the other niggers, he remains the same obedient, faithful old Bob.
               Bob also, was much given to 
                     religous
                     religious
                   thoughts and exercises, 'and versed the Psalms of David to the air of Yankee doodle, for thanksgiving days.'
               Alas, poor Bob— 
                     
                        "Thou art Freedom's now, and Fames,
                        One of the few, the immortal names,
                        That were not born to die."
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               
                  Re-Union Meeting.
               
               The war had greatly demoralized our people. I mean our common people—the country people—the poor people. They had begun to think our cause was lost, and some of them went so far even as to say that I, and some other leading men had done very wrong in urging them to inlist in the confederate armies There was a very general feeling of distrust as to the propriety of longer looking to us for leadership. In fact, the common masses were heartily sick of war. and had made up their minds to have nothing more to do with any opposition to the government. They were perfectly contented to let the Yankees take their own course, and make no struggle against it. They were entirely too peaceably disposed to suit us. But the worst feature in their case was, their distrust of us, who had, from time immemorial, been their leaders. This must be remedied in some way, or through our own weakness we would be forever lost. It was a serious matter—a weighty matter, and withal very delicate, and difficult to manage.
               But we did it. The day had come for the public meeting. This was to be a re-union meeting, when we would relinquish publicly, all hope of secession and slavery.
               I went into Col. Long's back office. There was Stout, Doubleface, and Randolph. We considered who should be chairman of the meeting. Of course we must give the offices to the country people. We decided on Mr. Black, for President, and Jones, and Hippenhammer for Vice Presidents. Mr. Putnam, the editor of one city paper, the Smithville Reporter, was thought a fit man for Secretary.
               This settled, next in order was the resolutions. We always pass resolutions at our public meetings. Col. Long, being a ready writer, and knowing well how to guard the law points, proceeded to write them out. When finished, he read them to us. We made a few verbal alterations, to make them more general and less to the point; then they were read again, and considered perfect. Long put them in his pocket, as we went to Poole's; called in a number of our country friends, directed Poole to let them have what they wanted, took a little Robertson ourselves, and went up to the Court House. Quite a crowd had already gathered.
               Mr. Randolph, called the meeting to order, and nominated Mr. James Black for chairman, which being duly seconded by Jake Prim, was put and carried. I then nominated Mr. Zedekiah Jones, and Samuel Hippenhammer for Vice Presidents. This carried, when Col. Stout moved the appointment of Mr. Anderson Putnam, Editor of the Smithville Reporter, as Secretary, after the adoption of which, the meeting was duly organized.
               The President then stated the object of the meeting to be to show to the world, and especially to the people of the United States, that when we surrendered our arms at the conclusion of our late unhappy differences, we did it in good faith; that when we swore allegiance to the federal government, we meant what we said, and intended to keep that oath inviolate; that we had no unkind feelings towards our Northern fellow citizens, and welcomed there in our midst; that we recognized both slavery and secession as dead, never more to be agitated; in short, that we were whipped and we knew it, and now proposed to be good and law abiding citizens of the United States and of Tennessee. This short and practical speech was received with great favor by the crowded house.
               Col. Long moved the appointment of a committee on Resolutions. According to parliamentary usage, the Colonel being the mover, was appointed chairman of the committee. There were four others appointed Gen. Doubleface, Hon. Mr. Randolph and two gentlemen from the country Esquire Goodloe, and Major Snodgrass.
               In the absence of the committee, I was invited to address the meeting, which I proceeded to do. I said:
               'Mr. chairman, and fellow citizens of middlebury County and of the city of Smithville: We have met on a very important occasion, and to consider what is the best course for us to pursue. We have had a great war, as you are all aware, and we, unfortunately, have not came out quite whole. Indeed we have been a good deal worsted in that fight. You all know—the whole country knows that Tennessee was for the Union. We were all for the Union. We are for the Union to-day. Gentlemen:—the old Union, the constitutional Union. You know, how long I stood up for the Union. Every man in Tennessee was a union man, but we never believed it was right—constitutional tutional, I mean—to save the Union by coercion—by war; and that, fellow citizens, is what aroused the old volunteer State to arms. Yes, we were Union men, every one of us, but we would not fight for it. It must be saved by peaceable means if at all. When our sister South Carolina, seceded, we said let her alone, let her go. Yes, we said let her go in peace; don't go to fighting about it. It didn't matter much no how. She was always an unruly child. This reminds me of a little anecdote, which is too good to be lost, that I once heard of my distinguished friend Daniel Webster.
               Right here I was interrupted by the chairman who recognized the Commit tee on Resolutions, and I simply added: 'I see the Committee on Resolutions are ready to report. That Committee is composed of honorable gentlemen. I have not the most remote idea what will be the character of their resolutions. But whatever they are let every man present indorse them.' ['Will hear them first,' said some one in the crowd.] 'We must not be divided now. We have no time for dissention. 'United we stand, divided we fall."
               My speech did not meet with that public approval to which I thought it entitled.
               Col. Long then took the stand and read his resolutions. They were of course just what we had already prepared, and consisted of several sheets of 'whereases' and six resolutions. We whereased that as there was a mutual distrust between the sections lately at war; that we had had some unhappy differences; that those differences were submitted to the arbitrament of the sword; that the result of that little arbitration was not greatly in our favor; that we had surrendered; that the nigger was free; and that we were still citizens of the United States.
               Then we resolved: First, That we accepted the situation fully, freely, wholly, honorably and unreservedly.
               We resolved, Second, That we still had a great desire to live and die in the country where we were born; that we owed, and would bear true allegiance to the government both State and Federal.
               Third, we resolved, That we would unite our voices and influence against any and all discussions calculated to keep alive the animosities engendered by our late unhappy differences.
               Fourth, We looked upon slavery as dead beyond all resurrection.
               Fifth, That the nigger was free, but it wasn't his fault; we had proven ourselves his best friends in the past, so we would be in the future, and hence we invited the Bureau away.
               Sixth and last, we resolved, That we were anxious to bury the past, and unite with all good people in restoring union, harmony and peace. We were friendly to the Northern immigrant, would invite him here to help build up our waste places, and anybody who said we were not sincere, was a liar.
               These resolutions were ably and eloquently indorsed by several of our leading and most influential citizens. Gen. Doubleface grew very eloquent when upon the subject of allegiance to the government. He said he had laid down the sword, never to raise it again except under the stars and stripes. He may have been wrong, but whether wrong or right, he had abandoned his cause forever, and was ready to follow Uncle Sam's banner anywhere on earth where there was an enemy of the United States to fight. His speech was received with great enthusiasm. He had struck the right chord. The people wanted peace, and so did the General.
               Billy Ward then started a call for 'Hapsburg,' which was repeated by a large number of voices. As he was present [so indeed was every Yankee in town] he was invited to take the stand which he modestly did. This was his speech:
               'I indorse the resolutions most heartily. In war we were enemies, in peace let us be friends. If these resolutions correctly represent the feelings of this people, then the government has achieved all it intended. So long as you maintain in practice the faith here pledged, you are my friends, and I am yours.'
               This short, but eloquent speech elicited a hearty round of applause from the audience, who appeared delighted.
               Then Gen. Short was called upon, and he spoke with more reserve, perhaps, but in substance the same as Hapsburg. The meeting then adjourned.
               Col. Long, Mr. Randolph, General Doubleface and myself congratulated Hapsburg on his candid, manly speech and expressed our entire approbation of his remarks. We all hoped to hear him often and in a similar stratu. We assured him, that with us, the war was over, and nothing was so much our desire as a lasting peace and good will all over the country. Especially did we desire that the most friendly relations should exist among our own people here. We were pained to know that our Northern friends still doubted our sincerity, and knew no better way to disabuse their minds than by executing our promises in practice, which we intended honestly to do.
               He seemed greatly affected by our warmth of feeling toward him, [which I must confess was of sudden birth] and replied by telling us that we could not treat him and his friends better than they would treat us.
               Doubleface took my arm and we walked out of the Court House together. Looking back over his shoulder to see if 'the way was clear,' he quietly remarked to me, that he had struck the right chord, and if we only managed well, there would be no difficulty in winning Hapsburg to our support. 'But,' said he, 'the fire is gone out among the people; they are thoroughly whipped and beaten. This cannot be allowed to remain so long. We must never let the spirit of our cause die. It is sacred, and must not he abandoned.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               
                  Several New Characters.
               
               It is the custom of our lawyers, according to the ancient English rule, to follow the court in its course to the various terms at different points in the circuit. In our circuit there are seven counties. On the Monday after the meeting described in the last chapter, court was to commence at Calhoun, the county seat of Pitt, a neighboring county. There being no mode of public conveyance, and our roads as usual, not being fit for buggies, we all went on horseback. Calhoun was some forty miles distant. Therefore, in order to reach it in time for court, it was necessary to start on Sunday morning Bob brought my horse to the gate and as I was mounting said:
               'Marse Dick, I done got Sam to buy dem 'visions, and sont 'em up, but he said de lady done died before he cum dar.'
               'What did he do with them, then?' I asked.
               'He luff dem dar wid de black uns, Marse Morton was dar; he say he take care ub dem.'
               Poor woman, thought I as I rode away. It was wrong to let her die that way, right in the midst of a christian people. But Mr. Morton will now care for the children, so that they need not suffer longer. He is a good, kind man, and a high toned gentleman besides. I am glad they will get into such good hands. The children ought not to suffer for the sins of their parents. This thought relieved my mind a great deal, and I rode on out to Smith's Spring five miles on the way, where I met the other attorneys. As is our custom, we took a hearty drink each of Robertson, cooled with the clear water, lit our pipes, and proceeded on our way. At about two in the evening, we stopped at old Jamy Flynn's and had a cold snack.
               Now, Jamy keeps the best apple brandy in the world. He had us sample it just before, and again just after lunch. We unanimously pronounced it very fine; and after saying a great many pleasant things to Mrs. Flynn, we filled our pipes and mounted. Jamy had three or four heavy suits in the Calhoun court for breach of warranty in the sale of negroes.
               We arrived at our destination about an hour by sun, engaged our rooms, washed up a little, finished a bottle or two of Robertson, and was ready for supper. After completing that important meal, which consisted of eggs boiled, eggs fried, eggs scrambled, eggs omelette ham, very strong coffee, butter, the 
                     whightest
                     whitest
                   in the world, with plenty of the best buttermilk, and bright, smoking, yellow and blue biscuit of great specific gravity, we repaired to the great wide porch in front, where we were enjoying our pipes, and discussing who should stand guard the first night to watch and announce the movements of the bed bugs when Gen. Short rode up, and quietly alighted.
               The nigger boy took his horse, and the General was shown to supper. About the time we supposed he was finishing his meal, and before he had time to be with us, we all took a walk, and returned to our rooms. He was shown to a room up stairs, where he spent the night alone.
               This was the first term of Court held at Calhoun since the war. The town had suffered some, and the Court House was destroyed. Court was called in a small room, where a store box three feet square, and one foot high, with a split bottom chair on top, was laid against one of the walls for a stand on which the Judge was to be seated. Planks stretched on empty nail kegs, served for jury and attorneys' seats, with a small three-by-four table for the use of the members of the bar engaged in the suit on trial.
               'O! yes, O! yes, O! yes, the Honorable Circuit Court's met pursuant to adjournment. God save the State and this Honorable Court', cried the Sheriff from a window, and Court was duly opened.
               Before the Sheriff had returned from the window, I heard a kind of rattling, jingling noise on the steps, and looking towards the door, I saw a plain country farmer walking rapidly in, and direct to where the Judge was sitting. The farmer was dressed in brown jeans pants, a very white, coarse osnaberg shirt, having sleeves much too short for comfort, suspenders of the same strong material, a pair of dusty brogans, and a drab colored hat which evidently had seen a good deal of hard service. The brim was drawn considerably down in front but stood very straight up behind. The gentleman was of medium hight, very slender and a little stooped. His chest and abdomen were very flat, and limbs long and thin. He might have been thirty-five years of age. His hair was sandy, rather long, and a considerable quantity of it hung down under the front part of his hat, with a small portion, very improperly dangling on the outside of an upper aperture of that venerable covering. Over his left shoulder, tied together by a stout cord, were suspended four plow points. It was these that made the jingling noise I had heard, and which as he walked, attracted the attention of all persons near. In his right hand he held a rope plow line.
               This man, I say, walked directly and rapidly, taking very long steps, to where the Judge was sitting. Suddenly stopping in front of the Judge and within a few feet of him, staring in his Honor's face, said in a stentorian tone of native simplicity: 'I want to know who's the Judge of this Court.'
               'Mr. Sheriff,' said the Judge, 'take that man to jail, and instruct him how to enter a Court room. When satisfied he knows that much, return him into Court'; and the poor fellow, very much surprised at the turn things had taken, and also very ignorant of what it all meant, looking wildly and imploringly around upon the people in the room, reluctantly retired with the Sheriff, to enter upon his course of studies, the plow-points quite unconscious of the part they were playing in the matter, swinging and ringing about his bony shoulders as he walked slowly out stepping much shorter than before.
               After empanneling and charging the Grand Jury, his Honor adjourned until the next morning Not having seen the people of the good County of Pitt for some years, I mingled freely with them and shook the honest hand of many a good old farmer. Every one I met desired to know 'what that Yankee scoundrel and thief was doing there. I heard a great many threats of lynching him forthwith, but I prevented any of this from getting to his notice. I told them he had been a high officer in the Yankee army, and if he were injured, the good people of the county might be made to suffer for it. They undoubtedly would be held responsible for it.
               'Now,' said I, 'we have the courts starting again. Let us take our troubles all there. It will never do to molest this man at this time, and especially during the sitting of the court.'
               By such reasoning, I induced them to defer their action, but it was a very difficult task. I was fearful they would mob him there, and that in open court. But I managed to keep it perfectly still, so that Short knew nothing about it.
               I found a great many country people in town, and as the Yankee armies had done a great deal of damage in the county, there were many citizens who had lost property and wanted pay. A little shrewd, crafty Carpet-bagger was already there engaged in prosecuting claims. The people of Pitt county had always looked to Smithville for advice and orders. They were in the habit of waiting until they heard from us, and then doing what we directed. Because of this fact, it was not so necessary for me to be guarded in my conduct, and I took a seat in the office of Major Faust, claim agent; and I was right glad that I did so. I found I could be of great service. The Major had two clerks busily engaged in filling up the printed blanks, while he heard the statements of the different claimants. Each one, of course, felt it to be his duty to detail very minutely the history of himself and neighbors during the war, taking care, at every salient point, to notice how 'mean' the Yankees behaved, and how much they 'stole.'
               Good, honest men that they were, simple minded and true to their country, they gave the Major to understand that 'all they wanted was their money.' They had no love for the 'Yankee machine,' and didn't 'care a d—n how soon the whole thieving system was gone to h—I.' Yes, they were honest and plain spoken, so that there need be no mistaking their opinions of the Yankees. Some sixty-five took the oath and proved their loyalty, during the two hours I remained in the office. The Major was also a Justice of the Peace—appointed by Brownlow—and they took the oath before him.
               I said I was glad I had gone into the office. Many of them referred the matter of their loyalty to me. I knew they were Tennesseeans, were all high toned gentlemen, and would not swear to what was not true, and I so stated to the Major. There was one fact connected with the history of that county which I was assured was true, that some six or eight homemade Lincolnites were hanged in '61, and some families of Union men driven out, and their houses burned. But that was past, and I was for letting by-gones be by-gones. Each claimant had to sign the papers twice, and each witness once. This necessarily required a good deal of signing of names. Here, I was of great service. The clerks filled up the blanks, the Magistrate heard and swore the claimants and witnesses. Our people are a plain, unvarnished, 
                     nlettered
                     unlettered
                   people. Our public school system, which had been in operation for forty years or more, was never intended to be useful, and its objects were admirably carried out. A great many of our good citizens have not paid any attention to educational matters, and of course, have never acquired a knowledge of reading or writing. So here, as the papers were filled up they were handed to me, to write the names of the persons who were to sign them, and attest their signatures. Out of the sixty-five claimants from various portions of the county, and one hundred and thirty witnesses, I wrote the names of just eighty-nine, while they made their marks. I was truly glad I had gone in, for I do enjoy a little mingling ling with these good, plain, honest people, and especially so, when I can render them any service.
               It was egg-time again, and I repaired to what was known in Calhoun as the City Hotel, for my supper. Gen. Short was seated at tea with us. We gave him as little of our attention as possible, and after we left the dining-room, I invited him into my room, where we smoke a cigar together. I prefaced my invitation by the remark that I would be engaged during the night till bed time in writing out a bill in chancery, but would be glad to have his company while we smoked. So, that after we had concluded that pleasant entertainment, we separated, and I repaired to the room of Gen. Doubleface.
               After discovering in how many shapes, positions and places we could place a little good whisky, we took up the subject of the dangerous posture of affairs in regard to General Short. We were all well satisfied that he was not safe, and we were satisfied further, that the longer his stay was protracted, the less safe was his life. A very little whisky added to the bitter feeling against him, might at any moment precipitate trouble. We did not feel like defending him publicly, for that would damage our position with the people; and yet we did not dare to let him be injured in our presence with out offering him assistance, for this would injure us with the government. Our situation was very embarrassing indeed. We had no love for Short, and did not care how soon he was missing, but we must not know anything about it; so that we could pass resolutions deploring the act. The question was what should be done.
               'Let them hang the scoundrel,' said Long.
               'Vox populi, vox dei,' said Stout.
               'Away with him. Crucify him, crucify him,' added Randolph.
               'Gentlemen,' said I 'the killing of this man, at this time, and under present circumstances, would delay our cause a year; and besides, the people of this county are now filing a great many claims against the government. All of these will be defeated if we let the angry people have their way. We are surrounded by many troubles, and we can remove them only by being prudent.'
               Gen. Doubleface then said: 'This fellow will be out of our way before spring. Be cool, and let the Yankees think we are doing works meet for repentance. There is no trouble about getting rid of him, but I agree with Major Bascom, that the thing must not be done here and now. There's too much at stake. I see but one way to solve this problem. Let the bar ask the court to adjourn to court in course.
               'Agreed,' said all, and we displaced about a pint of whisky, and then retired for the night.
               I was just putting on my hat in the morning to go to the court-room, when two country men, each armed with two good revolvers, came into my room followed by Gen. Doubleface. I saw at a glance there was 'something in the wind.'
               'Where's Gen. Short?' one of them asked.
               'Gone to court, I think,' said I.
               They turned without a word more and walked toward the door, but Gen. Doubleface stood there, and asked: 'What do you want with Gen. Short?'
               'We want to shoot the thievin scoundrel,' was the reply.
               'But you must not do that,' said the General.
               'When we want advice we'll ask for it,' said the stranger.
               'You don't know what you are doing,' said Doubleface. 'Would you endanger your own lives, and my life, and the lives of many of your own citizens, just for the sake of having a little revenge out of this fellow? He is not worth your notice. And remember we are not out of the woods yet; we're in a tight place, and we must go slow a while.
               'He had one of our boys shot durin of the war, and we're goin fur him. Jist git out ov the way, ef yu please.'
               'No;' replied the General, 'I tell you that man must not be harmed here to-day. I hate him as bad as you, and want to get rid of him just as much, but we all can afford to wait till a better time comes. I know better than you what can safely be done, and I notify you that you will have to walk over my dead body before you kill Short. If you want to kill him bad enough to take my life first, then begin on me just now, for I am in earnest.'
               This somewhat disconcerted the men, for they knew Gen. Doubleface was a high toned Southern gentleman, and would not advise them wrongfully. They said they would not 'hunt him up, but he must not cross their path,' and the General permitted them to pass out.
               These two men, Doubleface informed me, had done good service in the war as flankers, scouts, spies, etc. The Yankees called them guerrillas. They belonged to Captain Jerrymander's company, whose field of operations was within the lines of the Yankee armies. They had no regular organization; did not wear any regular uniform. They operated just as the situation required. When the way was clear, they moved in considerable bodies; (I am speaking in general of this class of supporters of the Confederate cause.) but when Yankees were near, and in too dangerous proximity, they readily disbanded for the time, and went to plowing corn. They were a kind of citizen soldiery—minute men— who so annoyed the Yanks that large bodies of troops were found necessary to be placed at different places through the country, where they would not have been needed at all had it not been for these bands of brave and good men, whose rapidity of movement, and mystery of tactics, made it next to impossible to capture them, for they understood every ravine, cave, and other hiding place in the country. They rendered invaluable service to the Confederacy in keeping back such large numbers of Yankee troops to guard valueless points. Five of them could get up a big enough 'scare' in one day to keep a regiment of Yankees there six months. Our good people encouraged them; furnished them all needful supplies.
               The names of these two men, as the General, who was acquainted with both, informed me were Pete Dawson and Harry Saunders. Pete was an excellent shot, brave as a lion, and gave the blue coats a great deal of trouble. If scalps had been in demand, he could have shown his share; for he had slain many an un suspecting Yank.
               They had scarcely left the room, when short came leisurely down the steps and was on his way to the court. We both at once followed him, and as soon as we could overtake him, separated, one walking on each side of him. Thus we went to the court-room with this hated thing between us, who knew nothing whatever of the terrible storm which was gathering round him.
               The bar asked an adjournment. The court granted it, and before the people knew what was going on, we were on our way home. Col. Long and myself accompanied Short until he was out of danger, when we stopped at a house by the wayside, and he went on. We were met only once by men who would have harmed him.
               We had supposed that he knew nothing of his danger, until we were about separating, when he remarked smilingly, 'I am not any too safe in this neck of woods.'
               'Oh,' said I, 'you are not in any danger, sir, at all.'
               'I smell it in the atmosphere,' said he, and rode on.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               
                  The Yanks in trouble again—The little Blue-bellied farmer—Nigger Schools—Pinchbeck on social ethics.
               
               McCarty was a noble man. He was a true representative of the high toned Southern gentleman. Whole souled, genial, accommodating brave and to the south true as the compass. He was one of those social, affable gentlemen, who, while he could wish you any where else in the world than in his presence, would let you feel every thing but just what he thought of you. Now McCarty was on good terms with the Yankees while they were here. He was a good Mason, and that was greatly to his advantage. He never suspended his business;—he always had a permit to trade when a permit was necessary; he always had a pass to go in and out of the lines; in fact, he informs me that he never was refused a favor from the Military during the whole war. He had three boys in the Confederate army, and had furnished one thousand dollars in the beginning towards equipping and arming the noble sons of the South. No man could say and do more than he did, to urge on the people to war. A noble fellow was Tom McCarty.
               And the Yankees liked him. They had faith in his integrity; believed what he said, and gave him many liberties which were refused to other men? He took the oath of allegiance at a very early period; indeed his name appears first on the oath book. Yes he was the first man in Smithville to record his name in the 
                     Provort
                     Provost
                   Marshal's office, as having sworn to support the government of the United States. He was never required to take any other oath, except when he obtained a permit under some new regulation of the Treasury department. Our brave boys will never, never forget the name of this good man. We were never so far away, or in such a dangerous place as to be out of the reach of Tom's favors. Three months never passed at any one time after we left Smithville, without a package of something to eat or wear coming into camp from his generous hands. And we were never without accurate information of the situation at home. Tom always kept us well advised. We could and would have captured the Yankee garrison at Smithville several times, but Tom's voice was always against attack; 'for, said he, 'if we can't whip them without destroying Smithville, we can't do it at all, and I know that if you attack the garrison, the town will be left in ashes.' Tom served the city in this way just three times. He insisted on us fighting every where but in Smithville.
               It was because he was reliable, prudent, and so thoroughly posted in all matters concerning the welfare of our beloved city, that we all admired him. None had more friends than he. When we wanted to learn the situation, we always went to his store.
               Such thoughts as these passed through my mind as I was walking down the street in quest of news. I found Tom at work in the back part of his store, occasionally looking toward the window. I at once relieved him by looking myself. There stood the two Carpet bag lawyers again in trouble about the sign. The name of Short had been cut out this time. They looked about for the piece but could not see it. They took the sign down again, and Short took it off. He had not gone but a little way when he found his troublesome name lying in a sewer under some broad stones which were lain across to walk on. He picked it up, took it back to the office, replaced it in its old position, nailed up the sign again, and went quietly to work. He was scarcely seated when Judge Pinchbeck walked in and took a seat. McCarty at once went over to deplore the act, and to say that the good, responsible citizens condemned it.
               As he stepped out of the door, my friend Jones dropped in. Jones said he wanted to see some good farmer that would lease his farm. Now that the niggers were all loose, he did not care about carrying it on himself if he could find a good trusty white man to do it. I suggested that there were two Yankees here wanting to lease land. Perhaps one or both of them would suit him.
               I did not intend that he should act on my suggestion, but, when I discovered that he thought favorably of the matter, I could not retract, for it was not time yet to let him know our plans.
               When a Yankee does take up for the South, he will go farther, and do more thankless and dirty work for us than any of our own people. Jones had done all we ever asked him to do and was ready to do any amount more; but when a man has been educated in the North it does seem to me there is something born and bred in him which makes him unsafe to trust with any deep laid schemes of revolution. He will blow it out somewhere. All we needed Zed. for was to do what we bade him, and that he never failed to do. But he knew nothing of our secret plans; we never took him in as a 
                     consellor
                     counsellor
                  ; and as this was a more critical point than we had ever passed in our history, we were not willing to risk anything on him now.
               For this reason I did not desire him to know that I was not in earnest in my suggestion about the Yankee farmers. He thought the idea a good one and was rising to go over to the Yankee office when McCarty and Hapsburg came into the store. Zed. at once opened the subject of leasing his farm, and asked Hapsburg if he could not write and send him a good reliable farmer with a small family, who would lease his farm for a term of years.
               'Yes,' replied the Captain, 'I can get you just such a man as you say you want, and I will not be troubled in writing for him either. There is a young man now in my office that I can safely recommend as an excellent farmer and an honest man. He has no family but a wife. They are both industrious, intelligent and well behaved. He will be glad to accept your offer I have no doubt. I will call him in:' and he went round to fetch his friend.
               In a few minutes he returned with a short little man, straight as a gatepost, and looking as sober as Judge Pinchbeck. He introduced him as Mr. Small, the son of one of his old neighbors in Ohio. The little man took off his hat as he shook hands with each of us; said he was happy to make our acquaintance, and took a seat which McCarty handed him. He seemed to rely on Hapsburg for further conversation.
               This was all well enough in its way, but the thieving little scoundrel was wearing an army coat without ever having taken the buttons off. Now, I could see no propriety—none whatever—in bringing that insult upon us. The war was over, and it was time to lay off army clothes. I could see no use in keeping up this thing any longer. Some of our boys still wore their old army coats, but they were poor and had nothing else to wear. They were excusable. But this infernal scoundrel was brought in to insult us-nothing else; and after looking daggers at him—that was the only way I could then safely use daggers—I abruptly walked out.
               McCarty followed me to the door and asked me not to 'say a word about that coat. Zed. Jone's? wife would never consent to let that blue coated fiend live on her premises,' and he turned to go back, when I asked him what that crowd of niggers on the next block meant.
               'Oh,' said he, 'those are discharged nigger soldiers, at McClinlock & Brown's office, making application for bounty, pensions, back pay, etc.'
               'Bounty, pension, back pay, etc.,' said I involuntarily to myself. 'Is that the way our taxes are to go? Must I be taxed—when I can't vote—to pay bounty, pensions, back pay, etc., to these infernal niggers? Oh, how I do wish we had had about five millions more men. This disgrace would never have come upon us, I walked away most heartily disgusted, and could not help saying to Gen. Doubleface, whom I chanced to meet, 'that's the way our money goes.'
               'Look there,' said the General smiling, as he pointed up to Main street. And there was a sight. Enough to boil the blood of any true Southern man. Two hundred and thirty-two—for I counted them—young niggers in procession, dressed in their Sunday clothes, marching through the principal street of Smithville, carrying banners and badges, with such inscriptions as these: 'Education, the poor child's friend.' 'Education for all.' 'Public schools.' 'Educate the poor,' etc. etc.
               They had no drums nor life, and were making no noise whatever, save the singing of a song in which they all participated.
               'Has it come to this? Must the high toned Southern gentleman submit to such indignity? Is there no escape from such ignominy? By the gods! I am for the sword again,' and I began to speak faster and louder. Doubleface cautioned me to be 'careful—prudent.' 'D—n prudence! That's too much for any Southern man,' said I; and I candidly believe at this writing, that if I could have mustered sufficient force at that moment, before I had time to reflect, I would have scattered the procession instanter. But everybody came running up to where I was standing, and insisted on my being still, and behaving myself. The truth is, that at that time our people were pretty badly whipped, and were not anxious to renew the fight—not even with nigger children. But it was too much for me, and I went directly home by way of Poole's.
               My rest was not good that night. I was troubled with dreams. That infernal procession was walking through my brain all night, and their banners and flags were shining on the walls and ceiling of my room, I sometimes felt the weight of the whole mass concentrated on my breast, and some greasy wench about to spit in my face. I moaned aloud, and Mrs. Bascom asked me what was the matter. 'Niggers! Niggers!' said I, 'Niggers riding me all the time. Take that pile of spelling books off my throat, and the—flags——but, oh, I was dreaming about that infernal nigger procession. Go to sleep, love.'
               Judge Pinchbeck called on me early the next morning. He was born and raised in Smithville, and at one time was well thought of. When the war broke out, he was very violent in his denunciations of the Lincoln government, and was very active in every way he could, except paying money to fill up our armies. He did a great deal of good for us in the way of confiscating debts due by our people to firms in the North. When Smithville was captured by the Yankees, this man, next after McCarty, took the oath of allegiance, and at once set himself up as a Union man, and went to advising the authorities at Washington about affairs in Tennessee. McCarty kept us informed of all his movements. He soon managed to be regarded, where he was not known, as a friend of the government; took an active part in that stupendous fraud called the reorganization of civil government in this State, and immediately thereafter was appointed Judge. This was a class of men that, as a general thing we thought much less of than the genuine Yankee, for we look upon all Southern born Union men as traitors to their country. We give them no social advantages whatever, and don't speak to them anywhere. We had a few—very few—true original Union men, but the great mass of our native Unionists west of the Cumberland mountains, learned their first lessons in this orthodoxy by the light of Federal camp-fires. And, although I may be mistaken in my estimate of our neighbors in East Tennessee, I very much incline to the opinion that their love for the Union consisted more in their hate of rebels than in the memory of their fathers.
               But this man Pinchbeck had no pretentious to original Unionism. He was a coward, a traitor, and a perjured villain. That is my estimate of him. We despised the class of men to which he belonged, but we knew he had not sense enough, or if he had, moral courage enough to injure us when he was placed where we could watch, and occasionally advise him. I say he was born right here, and he hadn't been with the Yankees long enough to forget the influence of our ancient discipline. While we despised his class, we had work for him to do; and for this reason, as well as for the fact that did we not fondle over him some, he might do us harm, we thought best not to discard him entirely. So we treated him with what, in his eyes, now that he was elevated to the bench, was great respect, while in our estimation it was supreme contempt.
               
               He had called, he said, to consult with me on the propriety of having some kind of public entertainment provided where none but males should attend, and inviting the 'gentlemen from the North who had recently settled in the city. He said he thought the people could ascertain in that way whether these gentlemen were fit to take into our society; and if they were, then he proposed that we manage some good way to get their ladies acquainted with ours.
               Said I: 'Judge, have you invited any of them to your house?'
               'No,' he replied; 'only when my family is not at home. My daughters, you know, are going out into society, and if they were to associate with these people that would at once ruin their prospects for life. No; that would not be advisable just now.'
               'Then why do you want all our daughters placed in the same predicament?' I asked.
               'My object,' he continued, 'is to effect a revolution in our social system in that respect, so that we may all join in the matter, and then it would be a general thing. It won't do for one alone to make a move in that direction. It would be social death to him. But if we would all work together, we could, in my opinion, do more in that way to restore harmony and good feeling among the people than in any other way. If we don't take them into our social meetings, they will soon become dissatisfied and leave.'
               'Let them leave;' said I: the sooner the better.'
               'But,' added the Judge: 'The citizens are pledged to this in the resolutions recently passed in public meeting, and——'
               'Stop right there:' said I: 'Have you not lived in Smithville long enough to know that resolutions passed in public meetings, don't mean anything?'
               'Well, yes, I know that all well enough; but this was a solemn pledge made to these people and to the whole country. I think we had better be honest.'
               'Hear me a moment,' I said in the most grave tone I could command. 'You are a great man. We all have a very high regard for you and your family. You are now occupying a very exalted position. You can be of great service to us, and an honor to your name, if you will but act prudently, and listen to the counsel of your friends and admirers.'
               'I will do it,' said he.
               'Be as friendly as you wish with the Yankees;—that will be better for you. But,'—and I assumed a tone of confidential candor,—'don't invite them to your house; don't drink with them; and above all, as you regard your good name and the success of your family—don't throw any business into their hands.'
               'What do you mean?' He somewhat excitedly asked.
               'Just what I say;' I coolly replied.
               'Then are we never to receive them into our society at all?'
               'Never,' said I: 'Never.'
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               
                  Legal propositions—Carpet-bag capital—Bureau officer's visit.
               
               'Every thing is working well' said General Doubleface to me in his office about an hour after the conversation related in the last chapter. 'The Yankee sign was all carried off last night. Both names gone this time. The Yanks look blue. Poor devils, I pity them, but they can't stay here.'
               'Has any one been sent to see them and deplore the act?' I asked.
               'Oh, yes; that was attended to this morning in good time. I did that little job myself,' said the General, wearing his usual happy smile. What a cover that smile is. How much it hides of the fire back of it. Sometimes, in my admiration of that genial smile, connected with a knowledge of what lies behind it, my mind instinctively runs back to early history, and I compare that face in its serenely pleasant expression with the battlements of heaven, behind which the revolting angels were marshalling their hosts for the celestial rebellion.
               I began to relate the substance of what Judge Pinchbeck had proposed to me, when that individual presented himself. He, too, had heard of the carrying away of the sign, and characterized it as 'a shame and scandal.'
               'Yes,' said the General, 'that was a very low-down thing. But you know Judge, the responsible people of Smithville deplore and disapprove the act.'
               'I know that,' said he, 'and I will go now to their office and tell them so.'
               'Stay a moment,' said the General. 'Before you leave, I wish to consult you about the bearings of a legal proposition.'
               'No; I will not hear it,' said the Judge. It may come before me some time on the bench.'
               'This is a matter that will never be taken into court. My proposition is this: When one of two partners retires from the firm, the retiring partner has no right to continue the partnership by choosing his successor, and compelling his old partner to accept his choice.'
               'That is correct,' said the Judge.
               'Then,' resumed the General, 'you were a partner in the law firm of Pinchbeck & Graves. You have retired. You have no right now to compel Graves to accept these Yankee lawyers as his partners.'
               'I had no such thought,' said the astonished Judge.
               'Then don't talk about turning over your unfinished business to them,' added the General, laughing at the victory he had won.
               'Oh, I had no intention of doing anything of the kind,' the Judge responded, 'but I had thought I would throw all the crumbs I could in their way. I want to see them prosper.'
               There, thought I, is another of the General's strategies. Without any indication of his real purpose, he states a plain, incontrovertible principle of law, and by appearing to submit it to the judgment of a high judicial officer, whose vanity is much above his sense, gets his opinion upon it, and then applies it in practice so as to defeat simply by a legal proposition adroitly put, what he intended never should occur in any event.
               About this time Zedekiah Jones happened in. He was not looking any too pleasant.
               'How is your Yankee farmer getting on?' I asked.
               'My wife says she don't want any blue coated Yankees about her premises, which lays that matter all quiet responded he. 'But I understand' continued he 'that McClintock and Brown have purchased a large tract of timber on the river, and are making contracts for shipping wood and logs to Paducah and Cairo. They have purchased two thousand acres, and paid for it all in cash. And Heiberger that fellow who was trying to lease land the other day has bought out the old Pete Spooner farm on the Turkey wing road.'
               'Then they have money?' said I interrogatively.
               'Yes, McCarty says they have about five thousand dollars apiece deposited in Bank after paying for their land. The Little Hoosier used his all up in the farm, and then only paid for half—$4,000. The title ain't any too good, I understand.'
               'Have the other lawyers got money? I asked.
               'Short has money, but Hapsburg hasn't much—say eight hundred or a thousand dollars. He came with upwards of a thousand, but has to live on that.'
               'Do they want to purchase property?' I asked.
               'Yes, town property 'said he. They are purely lawyers and don't want to do any thing outside of their profession, but the other gentlemen have a turn for business generally.'
               'What about the little blue coat?' I asked.
               'He had only five hundred dollars when he came. He invested that in the tobacco crop out at the contraband farm, and not knowing any thing about taking care of tobacco, he lost all and is now in debt to the government four hundred dollars, or he soon will be.'
               'How long are they going to keep up that contraband camp?' I asked.
               'The officer in charge has been mustered out,' said he and Maj. Bunting has been appointed agent. Bunting was in the federal army. He takes charge of the machine to-morrow. They are making arrangements now as fast as possible to break the thing up, and get all the niggers at work where they can make a living for themselves. Just as fast as they can be hired out, they are to go. The agent is to make their contracts for them, and keep copies filed in his office. The schools will still go on.'
               'Are we to have that accursed Bureau hanging over us forever?' said I, and was going on to say something which I need now repeat, when a very tall, well made, and well dressed gentleman stepped to the door, and seemed to be wondering whether to come in or not.
               Jones at once recognized him, and introduced him to the General and me as Maj. Bunting from Indiana, Bureau agent. Of course we had to shake hands. I 
                     involutorily
                     involuntarily
                   shrank from the wretch's grasp. But the General was as placid as ever, and one would have thought there could not possibly have been any ill feeling between the soldiers of the late contending armies.
               'Gentlemen,' said Bunting, as he seated himself very gracefully. 'I have a very unpleasant duty to perform in this community, and would be glad to have the cooperation of the citizens of the place. The labor system of the country is greatly disorganized, and my orders are to assist in getting these colored people good homes and remunerative employment as rapidly as possible. I am directed to assist them in making contracts, and to look to their interests generally. There is as much labor required in the country now as ever there was, and the farmers I think would like to hire hands if they were advised that such is the desire of the government. There is no reason why we should not work together in this matter, for the government has the interests of all parties at heart. What may I expect from the people in this respect?' In asking this question, he was looking directly at me. I replied: "We are twenty-one years of age, sir, and do not need guardians.'
               "But," said he laughing: "You may need guards possibly."
               This nettled me and I replied with some warmth: "First you steal our niggers, and then hire them back to us with spelling books in their hands, while you dictate and write the contract. You've conquered our arms, but you'll never conquer our spirits."
               "I conquered about a gill of your best spirits at Poole's grocery a few minutes ago,' he said, laughing again.
               "I don't intend to be insulted sir," I replied. "Your hordes of hired thieves and robbers, invaded our peaceful country, have burned our towns, laid waste our fields, stole our property, and now, not content with all this barbarism, you insist on managing our niggers."
               "Were you in the rebel armies?" he impudently asked.
               "No," said I. "I was not in the army, but I was in the Confederate government service four years."
               "You ought to have been in the army," coolly and sarcastically replied the fiend: "for then you would not want to fight so badly now.
               'I could let the past alone;' added I;' but I can't endorse this continuing insult to our pride and good sense—this educating of niggers, and trying to make them equal to white people.'
               Here General Doubleface interposed: 'My friend Major Bascom has not seen as much to admire in the character of the Union soldier as I have, and he is apt to hold the Northern people as a mass responsible for the improper acts of a very few. His prejudices are strong, as, 
                     indeeed
                     indeed
                   are those of all of us. It will require time to soften his warm, impetuous nature down to a full and willing acceptance of the situation. The Major, in all other respects, truly represents our people. I think he is a little behind us in accepting the situation.'
               The General had not observed Jake Prim who was leaning against the door frame during the time of these remarks. As he finished, Prim began to strike the open end of the bowl of his pipe on the palm of his left hand to knock out the ashes and burnt tobacco, and broke out:
               'Gen. Doubleface you are wrong I know, and so do you, d—d well, that Bascom speaks the united sentiment of the whole community. We are down on the Yankee government, down on the Yankees, and down on the niggers. What's the use o' mincin things, when the plain truth's so easy told?' and he pulled a large twist of home manufactured tobacco out of his pocket, and began to cut off the end in small pieces to refill his pipe. [I will add parenthetically just here, that the General gets all his tobacco from Prim, who brings his choicest, and takes his pay in recitals of news from the General's own lips. Prim swears by his faith in Doubleface.] At the end of this unfortunate [for it was unfortunate] remark of Prim, the Bureau man put on his hat, remarking: 'Gentlemen, I perceive you have nigger on the brain,' and walked out.
               Gen. Doubleface stepped out directly after him, and they had some conversation alone outside the office. What the General said I never knew, for I heard nothing save what Bunting remarked as he left: 'He wasn't whipped enough.'
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               
                  My experience with the Bureau—Carpet-bag politeness—Rough justice.
               
               That Freedmen-s Bureau was giving me a great deal of trouble. Indeed, every part of the stupendous machinery used to run the nigger was not only distasteful to me, but absolutely disgusting and intolerable. I could not speak respectfully to any one connected with it. It was a stench in my nostrils. But then it was a part of a fiendish plan to subjugate and humiliate the South, and at that time, the only satisfaction I could get, was to abuse the thieving scoundrel in charge of it whenever I could find an opportunity.
               The evening of the day on which the events related in the last chapter occurred, my nigger girl Betty asked me for some money which she said was due her for labor. I told her I had no money, she must wait a few weeks. She said she had been waiting two months now, and she must either have the money, or she must go to some other place for work, for she had nothing to get provisions for her children with.
               This fretted me. I was not in the habit of having niggers talk back to me, and could not tolerate it. I struck her on the head with my cane and felled her to the floor in an instant of time. I struck her two or three licks, dragged her to the door and dropped her, and told her 'niggers were still niggers about my place.'
               My daughter, Sue, who had seen the whole affair, said the nasty thing deserved it all, for she was getting much too impudent of late, but she was fearful I had laid myself liable to arrest by the officers of the Bureau. I directed Sue to make Betty get what things she had in the kitchen, and leave the place at once, for when I thought of that Bureau, I grew violent in my passions, and might have shot the girl.
               Betty got up, staggered some, and walked slowly back to the kitchen where she had a spare frock, which 
                     hse
                     she
                   got, placed it under her arm, and coming to the door, burst out in tears, and said to me:
               'Oh! Marse Dick, do please give me sum money. De chillen haint got nary bite to——'
               Get out, you stinking wench, said I, and I knocked her out of the door with my fist.'
               She went off crying and sobbing. The next morning, I was enjoying my pipe and the Cincinnati Enquirer on the balcony, when a young buck nigger, dressed in a full suit of Yankee blue, came up to the gate and on to where I sat. Taking off his hat, he politely handed me a sealed envelope. On opening it, I read: 'Major Dick Bascom, Smithville, Middlebury county, State of Tennessee: This is to request your personal appearance at the office of the Agent of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, in said city of Smithville, at two p. m. this day, to answer the complaint of Betty Bascom. Signed B. B. Bunting, Agent.
               'Tell Mr. Bunting if he wants to see me, my residence is on Mulberry street, No. 15.'
               The nigger left and I continued my smoke, but I could not enjoy it. I was violent with rage.
               In about half an hour after this, I heard a steady, soldier-like tramp approaching, and looking up, I saw three nigger soldiers with muskets at shouldered arms and bayonet fixed, coming up to where I sat. Addressing me without any ceremony whatever, the corporal said, 'Major Bunting wishes to see you immediately.'
               'Tell Major Bunting to go to the devil,' said I. 'I don't want to see him.
               
               'But you are requested to go at once,' said the corporal.
               'There ain't niggers enough in this town to take me,' said I, quickly reaching for my pistol. But I was not as quick as they. In an instant their muskets dropped to charge bayonet, and the corporal said 'Give me that pistol, sir.'
               I hesitated. Their hammers clicked as quick as lightning. I handed him my pistol.
               'You must go immediately,' said the corporal. 'Walk in front of us.'
               And before I had time to realize my true situation, I was marching down the streets of Smithville in charge of three nigger soldiers.
               'Oh!' thought I, 'for a lodge in some vast wilderness, some boundless contiguity of shade,' where I might lie down and swear my life away.' But, though my Southern readers may think it very strange—especially those of them who, like myself, were not in the army, while I was boiling over with rage, a strange interval of sense came to me, and I saw my best course was to behave well, and I did.
               
               We approached the office. The corporal handed me a seat. Bunting was engaged and did not notice me any more than he did the niggers who were sitting in and around the place. There were at least one hundred niggers there to see what was to be done with me.
               The niggers are a singular people. Having had no law, they were a law unto themselves. They have a means unknown to all save themselves of communicating news, with the rapidity of forty telegraphs. When any event important, as they conceive, to their interests, occurs, it is known all over the country in twenty-four hours. How it is done remains a mystery to me to this day. They were rarely ever seen talking together, were not allowed either to congregate or travel about without permission from their masters; and then we generally had patrols who moved about the country to watch their movements. But still they were always posted.
               How the thing had got out, I could not tell, but I saw half a dozen niggers there from ten miles in the country, who looked at me with a kind of contemptuous stare, which, under more favorable circumstances, I should have very unceremoniously changed to something different. I knew every nigger in the room. At one time or another, I had owned at least half of them. Then I was master; then I was in my proper place; but now oh! how humiliated, and they here to witness my subjugation.
               Mr. Black was there, wanting to take two boys and a girl for a term of years. When he discovered that he would have to give them some education, he left, saying he didn't believe in educating niggers.
               Bunting dropped his pen, and looking at me, said, 'Major Bascom, it would have been very agreeable to me to spare you this, what I know must be, very painful ordeal. I sent you a polite request to appear at my office, but your pride was above your sense, and you sent me an insulting reply. I then felt it to be my duty to satisfy you that I am an officer of the government of the United States, and all lawful summons sent by me, must be obeyed. You are charged by a woman here with having committed an assault and battery upon her person, and also with owing her an account of ten dollars which you refuse to pay. Do you desire counsel?
               'I am something of a lawyer' I replied, 'and am my own counsel.'
               Then, are you ready to proceed with the hearing?' said he.
               'I object to the jurisdiction' I replied.
               'Upon what grounds,'? he asked.
               'Upon the grounds: First, That it is a State case, and our State courts are now open; and second, that un der our law a nigger is not a competent witness against a white person, and this woman is a nigger.
               'How then,' he asked, 'could this woman get justice if she were not permitted to be heard in court as a witness against a man charged with assaulting her person, merely because he was a white man? If a man may shield himself behind the color of his skin, how is the victim of his crimes to be heard?'
               'I am not disposed to argue the propriety of the law,' said I. 'I merely state the law as ground for objection to the jurisdiction of this tribunal in my case.'
               He seemed to pay no attention to this, but continued in the same strain.
               'A white man then may assault, maim, kill, or commit other crime upon the person of a colored man or woman, who, although as in this case, he or she may be as white as the beast who commits the crime, is utterly without remedy, if no white person was present to witness the outrage. This is a part of the system of slavery, and when slavery fell, so did all its supports, so far at least as the government of the United States is concerned. If I turn this case over to the State court——' He stopped suddenly and asked, Who is your prosecuting attorney?'
               'Major Jenkins,' appointed by Brownlow,' I answered.
               'How did he obtain his title of Major?'
               'In the Confederate armies,' I replied.
               'Then,' continued he, 'if I turn this case over to the State court, nothing more will ever be heard of it, and this poor woman will be without remedy. Your objection cannot be sustained. The hearing must proceed at once, unless you are prepared to show good cause for a continuance.'
               'Let me send for a witness, 'I demanded.
               'Certainly.'
               And he directed the boy who had first been to my house with the summons, to convey any paper I wished to where I directed. I hurriedly wrote a note to my daughter and the boy took it. At this point the man Judge Brown came in. A young man apparently about twenty eight, of medium stature, very neatly dressed in a business suit, and I must say, a very good, sensible looking fellow.
               My daughter came in with a very haughty air, and desired to know what she was wanted for among these niggers. Judge Brown quickly arose from his seat, requested the niggers to make room near the window, and opening a small closet in the corner of the office, drew out a rubber army blanket, which he placed carefully on the floor, on which he placed his own chair, and very politely requested Sue to be seated there. She indignantly refused. But the Major remarked, it might be an hour before she would be relieved and I advised her to accept the seat so kindly offered her. She took the seat, and Brown stood near her. He made some remark to her rather apologetic, as I understood it, of the situation, and he would make an effort to have her relieved as soon as possible. But Sue was too proud to reply.
               What a noble girl that is. When I looked upon her flushed face, her sparkling eye, and contemptuous lips. I felt that she was a jewel. Proud, beautiful girl. Oh! how she despised her situation, and loathed her situators.
               Betty Bascom! called the Major. 'Be sworn.' Betty came slowly forward. Her head was tied up so as to cover one eye, and some traces of blood were visible on her face. I did not know till then that I had struck her so hard. I must admit that I felt somewhat sorry for her. She held up her right hand and swore to tell the truth. I objected to her being admitted as a witness against me.
               'Do you plead guilty?' asked the Bureau.
               'I plead nothing,' said I. 'I object to the whole proceeding.'
               'Betty,' said the Major, 'state to me all you know about this matter that you have charged against Major Bascom, and be careful that you speak nothing but the truth.'
               She then stated what I have already written, and stated it correctly. When she spoke of having nothing for the children. Bureau asked her how many children she had. She answered 'three.'
               'Where's your husband?' he asked.
               'I has no husband,' she answered. 'I's a house servant.'
               'Then who is the father of those children?' the brute asked.
               'Young Marse Dick,' replied the wench.
               'Is he Major Bascom's son?'
               'Yes, sah; his oldes son?'
               'You say he owes you two months' wages, at five dollars per month?'
               'He owes me for my whole life time,' said she, 'but I only charges him fur de las two months. Dat wus de fus time he hire me to work fur money.'
               Looking towards me, then Bureau asked:
               'Have you any questions to put to the witness?'
               'None.' I answered.
               'Has she told the truth?' he asked.
               'No matter whether she has or not,' I replied. 'I am ready to submit to your judgment.
               Can this lady be relieved then?' asked Brown of the Bureau, who answered, 'Certainly; unless her father wishes her to remain.'
               I said I did not wish to examine her. Brown then made way for her to the door, and left the office in her company.
               Addressing me, Bunting remarked 'you owe this woman ten dollars for labor performed. That sum you must pay before you leave this office.
               Then you owe the Government of the United States fifty dollars for the pleasure you enjoyed in insulting and beating a woman who is the mother of three of your grand-children, and who has served you all her life. That sum I will allow you ten days to pay either to her or to me. Then you shall enter into bonds to keep the peace towards all colored people, and especially this woman Betty Bascom for one year. Besides, if you are a gentleman you will assist her in supporting her children.'
               I paid the sixty dollars. The Major then accompanied me to the office of Esquire Dundee, a Justice of the peace, before whom I entered into bond in the sum of five hundred dollars to keep the peace. Bunting then left me, bidding me 'good evening'
               I started for McCarty's by way of Poole's, mentally cursing the whole Yankee tribe, but was little more than on the street when I met Brown returning from my house which was in full view from the place where we met. As I looked up I saw Sue looking out of an upper window toward us. Brown, staring me full in the face, observed, 'I am truly sorry that we cannot get along just yet without these petty annoyances, for I am sure they must be annoying to gentlemen who are not acquainted with the discipline of troops. The Freedmen's Bureau is a remnant of the war, and necessarily a part of the machinery of the army. Its business is conducted, and doubtless will be for a short time yet, according to military rules. The only way to avoid these unpleasant encounters is to do just as we would in respect to State tribunals,—obey the process without delay or resistance. It will save much trouble and anxiety.'
               'Yes,' I replied, 'my recent experience points that way,' and was going to pass on, when the fool added 'to speak of more pleasant things, I discover you have a very desirable residence. Your daughter was good enough to show me those choice evergreens and fall flowers in your front yard. Good morning, sir:" and the beast walked hurriedly away.
               I was startled; I was confused; confounded. I looked after him, took an unusually large chew of tobacco, placed my hat a little more on one side of my head, and involuntarily spit on my hands and began to roll up my coat sleeves; but he was going rapidly away with as much apparent independence as Claib. Jackson when he published the Declaration of Independence for Missouri at New Madrid. What the devil did he know about my 'residence,' the 'evergreens and fall flowers?" My daughter was "good enough;"—oh, ah; yes;—my daughter!—aye, my daughter was good enough to 'show' him my evergreens, fall flowers etc. Well, she'll not show him anything else while I am above ground. I turned toward McCarty's, and there, right in front of me on the side-walk, came that old bore with his pipe, coolly remarking as he passed me. "Well, Major, they administer justice down there in a d—d rough way, don't they?"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               
                  Another interview—Carpet-baggers notified quit—Prim at the w n time—Short leaves—Pettibone smoked out—Yankee children—Schools—Our boys—Hapsburg black-balled.
               
               I was in a bad humor; that cannot be denied. McCarty laughed at my misfortunes, and said I would get used to it. He said he had been informed that some threats had been made against the Carpet-bag lawyers and we had better go over and deplore it. This news improved my mental condition some, for I had no tears to shed over threats of that character. But one thing was certain: I would not take any part in the deploring business. It was McCarty's time, and so I told him. We started and dropped in at Poole's.
               'Give me some of your best French brandy,' I demanded.
               'I'm plum out un French brandy to-day, Major, answered Poole, 'but I don sont clean down to Piduky for moa.'
               'Then give us Robertson.'
               He did so, and after saturating a little—a very little—loaf 
                     sngar
                     sugar
                   with it, we left for the scene of action.
               The Yanks received us as politely as ever, but did not appear as pleasant as heretofore.
               I have been very much mortified,' said Tom, 'to learn that these detestable annoyances have been repeated. I am quite certain that our good, responsible citizens very greatly deplore the act. It was done by some low-down, irresponsible fellow; or, possibly, by some excited youngsters in search of 
                     fnn
                     fun
                  .'
               Gen. Short handed a small piece of paper to Tom, which he said he had found under his office door that morning. It read as follows:
               'Get out of this, you d—d Yankees. We don't want you here. The sooner you leave, the better for you. Signed, Smithville.'
               'Besides that,' said Short, 'last night as I was going home from the postoffice, when I was passing under the shade of some trees, a pistol shot lighted my path. I saw no one and had no particular curiosity to reconnoiter. I went directly home. Notwithstanding your protestations, I am fearful that the people of Smithville are very anxious to get rid of me. If I can live here peacefully, and as a man among men, it is my desire to do so, but if I am in danger, I will at once go away. You are leading men. Now please be candid with me. Am I in danger or not?'
               'Why no!' answered Tom somewhat hesitatingly, 'I tell you frankly and I know what I speak, when I assure you upon honor, there is no responsible citizen of Smithville who would do you any personal injury. Of course we cannot be responsible for what these low-flung fellows do. They are in every community, and have no regard for the peace of society.'
               'Are you quite certain' asked Short, 'that there is no encouragement given by the leading citizens to those whom you call low-flung fellows, in this matter? During the war, I found that a community which was so disposed, could always prevent incursions and depredations of guerrillas, and I am strongly inclined to believe that this inexcusable lawlessness could now be prevented if the people really desired it.'
               'We certainly have not asked any one to shoot you,' said Tom, a good deal vexed.
               'But if I were shot, who would care?' asked Short.
               Just then, that old fool Prim showed himself at the door. He placed one foot on the door step, resting his hand upon his raised knee, and took his pipe out of his mouth to see how nearly he could spit on a butterfly which was crawling about the floor.
               'Short,' said the intolerable old wretch, 'your time's out. The people don't want you here. If you want to git out whole, there's no time to lose. We're h—l on Yankees here;' and replacing his pipe, he walked leisurely out into the street to look at some apples which a country man and woman were selling in an ox wagon, half covered with an old quilt. Tom's face colored a little under an uncontrollable smile.
               'Why don't you reprove that man?' asked Short.
               'Oh, he's one of these reckless, talkative fellows, who never mean what they say,' said Tom.
               'I look upon him as a weathercock which shows how the wind blows,' replied Short.
               'Why, he is the man,' said Tom, laughing, 'who hung a sheet out of his window on a broom handle when the gunboats came up the Tennessee the first time, and when they did not pay any attention to this evidence of his first surrender, he started for the boats with a very large expose of his white shirt, crying aloud, 'I've surrendered, I've surrendered.' There can't be much danger in a man who would surrender render to a Yankee gunboat.'
               'Well, gentlemen,' said Short, I can only say it is my opinion that the people of Smithville could prevent all such things, if they were so disposed.'
               'I am sorry you have such an opinion,' said McCarty, 'but we are not responsible. We say to you that the good citizens deplore the act, and we can do no more. Good morning;' and we left.
               I watched their office very closely that evening, and for an hour or two they talked to each other all the leisure time they had. At length they shut up their office, (they remaining inside) and I heard a noise as of nailing boxes. I will just add here, that in a very few days afterward, distance grew between Smithville and General Short and his family, as rapidly as a boat could take them down the Tennessee River—we were rid of him.
               
               We had smoked out Pettibone several months before this. As soon as the permit system was abolished and our own people had the privilege of again opening up their business houses, in less than two weeks, Pettibone had not a customer, save the Yankees who called on him occasionally. It was noticeable, however, that they distributed their patronage very generally among the merchants without any regard whatever to their politics.—They did not appear to care what a man's opinions were, and they never talked politics or discussed the war. How different from us in this respect.
               I said we smoked out Pettibone. In three weeks after our people began business, he sold his little stock of wooden hams, and Cincinnati-made Rhine wine at public auction, and closed up his establishment. The next we heard of Pettibone, he was an officer of the Treasury Department to bleed our people in the way of taxes. He had never been in the army, and was very liberal in his political opinions, but he was a Yankee, and we had no use for him.
               In order that my readers may know we were anxious to encourage good men who came to settle among us, no matter where they came from, I will here remark that a short time after trade opened in Smithville, a young man from Kentucky opened a business house in our city. He kept a confectionary establishment, with ice-cream, soda water, etc. Now, the bare fact of a man coming from Kentucky, has always been a good recommendation to our people, and this young man went immediately into a paying business. Everybody patronized him. He was young, handsome, very intelligent, well behaved, and unmarried. Beside this, he said he had served in the Confederate armies, been captured, taken prisoner, and all that. Our people extended to him a most hearty welcome. This young gentleman's name was Harry Burton.
               At the time of which we write, Lt. Coole had not gone into any kind of business. He was doing something, but no one of us knew what. He was in some way connected with the Yankee government, as we believed, and was not in the city much of his time. McClintock's family had arrived. He had two children. He had purchased a little house on the outskirts of the city and was living there. The nigger parson, it seemed, had thoroughly organized his schools, and was running his institution on a very large scale.
               We had some trouble about the Yankee children in our schools. I don't refer to our public schools; we don't have them in Tennessee except for poor children. But we have some widow ladies whose worldly possessions are not great, and they open up private schools to which those of our people who cannot afford to patronize more costly schools, send their children. We were not put to the necessity of taking any action in reference to the children of the nigger parson, for he did not offer to send his to any of our schools. They were taught by their mother at home, so I was informed. We never saw them on the street except in the evening at mail time, the boy Jimmy, a lad about fifteen, came to the postoffice, for his father's mail. He was a shy, but laughing little fellow, who wouldn't have harmed anything; but our boys, worthy sons of noble sires, inheriting the noble blood of the South, sometimes followed him and stoned him out of town. Once, indeed, his sister Mattie, a fair-haired, beautiful girl of fourteen, passed our high school alone while the boys were on the play grounds, and they (very ungallantly, I must confess,) annoyed her, and set her to crying and running home with both hands on her little face, by calling her 'nigger, Yankee' and asking her how she enjoyed her 'nigger bed-fellows, etc.' I very much deplored this act, as did all our good, responsible citizens, and I sincerely hoped it would not be repeated. When her father complained to us about the insult offered his daughter, we requested the teacher to ask the boys not to do so any more, which he did.
               But there were Hapsburg's young ones, Emma and Charlie. They were the first at school on the first morning and they were such shy, innocent little things, that no one could look in their face and wish them evil. They were very apt, but they were young Yankees, and that was what troubled Mrs. Baker, the teacher. I called upon her one day and heard her classes recite. I had gone to make arrangements for religious services there the next Sabbath. I was surprised to hear the precocity of the little Yanks. Mrs. B. said they were the best behaved children she had in school. While there, a nigger boy came to the door and asked for something which the boys had borrowed from Mr. Holme's school-house. After handing him the thing asked for, she remarked to me, 'If I had the control of this house, no nigger or Yankee should ever come inside of it.'
               She is a noble christian woman, that Mrs. Baker. But we saw no way to relieve ourselves yet, for we had much use for Hapsburg, unless we were deceived in him, and it was not wise at that time to 
                     dny
                     deny
                   his children access to our schools; so we took no action then.
               It was the same in the church and the Sabbath school. Their father and mother came regularly to church, and the children to school on the Sabbath. Although we would have rejoiced to find them guilty of some mean act to give us cause for expelling them, in this respect they were our masters. They behaved well—none better. But we had one privilege left, and that we enjoyed to our hearts' content. We hated them, and did not recognize them even in church, and none of our members ever called on them at their home. Some people may object to this course of treatment in such a case, but I can assure all such that it has a good effect in relieving a community of decent Yankees, for they can't stand it long.
               It is a singular fact, and worthy of record here, that we were greatly disappointed in the matter of these people not associating with the niggers. We never saw them talking or walking with niggers on the street.
               In a very few days the shooting at Short and his sudden departure, had got into the papers, and we were at a loss to know what was the best course for us to pursue. While we all rejoiced over the fact, still it would not be prudent to let the world know it, and in some way it must be made to appear that, we deplored the matter very much. Before we had arrived at any definite conclusion, however, we were very agreeably surprised to find that Hapsburg had already done our work for us. Without consulting us at all, he had published a card, relieving the people of Smithville—whom he called a generous people—from all blame. He was confident, he said, the responsible people of the place disapproved the act, and he believed he could muster a regiment of troops at any time in Smithville to follow the stars and stripes. [Joke.] This was news to us. He was in our service rather sooner than we had expected.
               Gen. Doubleface and Mr. Black expressed themselves to him in very warm terms, and thanked him for his generous defence of our people. He said he thought he had done nothing but his duty. We then concluded that we must hold on to him at all hazards. We could make him very serviceable to us in some trying time to come.
               But he gave us some annoyance too. About this time, by his request, his name was presented to the Masonic lodge at Smithville. He expressed a very great desire to become a Mason. That was, however, asking a little too much of us at that or any other time. We were compelled to admit McClintock, for he was a Mason, and there was no remedy in his case; but we were determined to keep all Yankees out who had no right to demand admission. Hapsburg was black-balled of course.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               
                  Carpet-baggers in a Tennessee Court room.
               
               Civil government—so called—was now fully established in Tennessee. The courts had been regularly held in Smithville for a year. The spring term in 1866 was at hand. The city was full of people from the country. With us, court week is always a busy time; the people will come to court. I heard the Sheriff calling the names of the attorneys and jurors from the Court House window, and the people were moving toward that venerable building, which, though of a very antique style, looking much like a large country flour mill, was a great addition to our city.
               The criminal docket was heavy this term. There were several murder cases to be tried, and a great number of Larceny. I walked leisurely up to the court room. Just as I reached the top of the steps and before I had yet got to the door, Hapsburg came rapidly up behind me. (These Yankees always seem to be in a hurry.) He opened the door and looking somewhat wildly into the court room, stopped, and wonderingly inquired of me, while his eyes wandered about the room what 'all that smoke meant—there must be a pipe broken some where. 'It smells like tobacco;' he said.
               'You haven't got the hang of our courts yet;' I jocularly remarked. 'The lawyers are smoking.'
               'Well;' said he: 'that is something new in my experience.'
               We stepped inside the door and stopped. He looked about the room in apparent bewilderment, and I will never forget the peculiar expression of his very pleasant face, as he pursed up his lips, and sniffed the smoky air of the room.
               This was a matter that had never attracted my attention before. We are all smokers here, and of course, from boyhood become accustomed to our smoke. And we don't make the court house any exception. The only place we don't smoke in is the church, but we make up for the loss there by chewing.
               Hapsburg's manner was attracting some attention, but when I announced the fact that he was admiring the atmosphere of the room, which I remember was very blue—he quickly ceased his stare and started for the bar, into which honored place he almost fell headlong, having tumbled over two large spittoons which he had not noticed.
               Colonel Stout inquired of him what he thought of a Tennessee court room, to which he coolly replied: 'I have no objection to the room, but I respectfully demur to the manners of its occupants.'
               He appeared to be uncomfortable. Every thing seemed strange and wrong to him. 'Why,' said he, whispering to me. 'Your order is very bad; the lawyers are all smoking and talking, the bystanders are talking, the judge is smoking, the officers all wear their hats, and every thing is in confusion. Can you do business in all this disorder?'
               'Oh:' said I, 'we are behind the age down here.'
               'I should think so,' said he, smiling.
               'Do you Yankees have any better order in your court rooms?' I asked.
               'Why,' he replied, again whispering. 'Our courts are as orderly as our churches, and a lawyer would be fined for smoking in the bar.'
               'Mr. Sheriff keep order while I charge the Grand Jury;' said the Judge, as he laid down his pipe.
               'Silence behind the bar, the Judge is goin to charge 'the jury' cried the sheriff in tones that seemed to frighten Hapsburg who turned very red, as he walked on his toes to the window, which he very quietly raised as though he were afraid of making a noise, and took a seat in front of it.
               Our Judge was a most excellent man—as a man—so we all thought. But as a Judge, we had many objections to him. He was ignorant, he was tyranical, he was peevish, he was oldwomanish, he was a fool. That was our opinion of him as a Judge. But our greatest objection to him—indeed I am not quite certain if it was not our sole objection—was, that he was one of Brownlow's appointees, and then, to make the matter still worse, he came from East Tennessee. He was one of those despicable creatures, known as East Tennessee loyalists. Our people hunted him out of his home in '61 and would have hung him if we could have caught him. We never liked him since. If this could have been remedied. I think it likely we would soon have forgotten all his other faults. But with us, to have been an active and consistent loyalist, was to have committed the unpardonable sin. We never have forgiven it, and never will. We hate traitors and Yankees. The Judge charged the grand jury upon one point, as follows: 'We are holding our courts by sufferance of the government of the United States. We must therefore act wisely and justly. We are not yet fully restored to proper relations with the general government. We have no representatives in Congress, and will not be likely soon to have, unless we so behave ourselves, and so conduct our courts, as to merit the confidence of the government. The war meant something. Peace means something. Our state was in rebellion. We now claim loyalty. All this means something. Our professions must be no more than true and real exponents of our practice. Slavery is abolished forever; not only slavery but all that made it slavery. The colored man has now his freedom guarantied by the National law, and we as supporters and friends of the government must see to it, that his new position is properly protected. We must do all men justice, not justice according to our individual notions; but justice according to law. Let the misdeeds of the war time, as much as possible. be buried. Do not harrow up the past more than is 
                     obsolutely
                     absolutely
                   necessary to meet the ends of justice. Devote your inquiries rather, to the present. In this way can we restore peace and harmony in our civil society. Let neither passion nor prejudice bias your judgement. Gentlemen, be just to all; present no one for any offence, for which you would not present any and every other. Consider not his past political history.'
               This quotation will convey to my readers a very correct idea of the mental calibre of Judge Parsons, and I presume I need add nothing more on that point. The first case called was the state of Tennessee against William Watson, Larceny. No counsel's name entered. Watson was a lad of perhaps 16, sallow, thin disconsolate looking little fellow, clad in thin muslin shirt, brown linen pants, and coat buttonless.
               'Have you no counsel?' asked the Judge.
               'No sir,' was the tremulous reply.
               'Have you any money to employ one?' 'No sir.'
               'Then,' said the Judge. 'Choose one among these lawyers, and I will appoint him to defend you.'
               'I don't know any body here,' said the boy, trembling from head to foot and as white as a living human face could be.
               'I will defend the poor boy your honor, said Hapsburg, rising to his feet. 'Will the court permit me to confer privately with him a moment?'
               
               'Certainly' said the Judge.
               The boy's face somewhat brightened. Hapsburg took him aside a few minutes and returned, Addressing the court, he spoke: 'May it please your honor, this lad has no defence to make. He will submit his case to the jury, admitting all that is charged against him. I desire to address the jury but a moment, and merely on the question of what punishment, if any, he deserves.'
               'Proceed,' said the judge.
               'Gentlemen of the jury;' began Hapsburg: 'This boy is charged with having stolen a vest worth five dollars from one of our merchants. He admits the taking, and excuses the act by saying he was a stranger to all; had been anxiously asking for employment two weeks, but received none; had no money; was suffering from cold; and took the garment because his other clothing was not sufficient to shield him from the winds of January, for he was compelled to sleep out of doors at night. He informs me that he has no parents living; he came from 
                     Kentueky
                     Kentucky
                   here of something to do. The merchant saw him take the vest and regained it before it left the store. With this state of facts, is he punishable? and if so, to what extent?
               'Under ordinary circumstances, this, would be larceny but is it so in this case? Was there felony here? or was it necessity? Were the citizens of Smithville culpable in not relieving him in some small degree from his pinching poverty? or is this homeless, starving waif to be held responsible for a grave crime when he did merely what the imperative necessities of his destitute condition, forced upon him by the pitiless hands of a barren philanthropy, required?
               'He acted from 
                     necesity
                     necessity
                  , not from choice; he begged employment, and received shame; he implored protection and was sent to prison. His little clothless body shook and trembled in the pelting storm, while the well-clad child of luxury passed laughingly on. He slept upon the ground, unnoticed by the happy passers by. Hunger gnawed at his wasting vitals, cold came freezing in at every pore, the cold, hungry starving child of poverty, seeing great bales of clothing piled on counters, where the warm air of the merchant's room made cheerful the hearts of those who had money; this neglected, despised monument of man's hollow heartedness, took the garment to cover up his little trembling heart.
               'This is not Larceny. This is not even crime. The wrong began not there. It was farther back. Society was to blame, not the boy. In the great upheaval of our social world when crime walked unmasked across the bloody land, had nothing greater than this escaped the eye of the law? While reflecting on the great mass of wickedness spewed out from the commotion of the times, let us not select this pale victim of our own wickedness, and hold him up to infamy, while we let the villian who has slain his dozens, go at large feasting upon the spoils of his own great crimes. This boy stands today upon the threshold of life,—up on the confines of two eternities. He looks back, and sees wretchedness, neglect, misery. He looks forward—you may make the prospect bright or dark as you will. Will you show him a redeemed manhood, glowing in the brightening distance, or the gloom and darkness of a prison cell? Cheer up his poor young, wretched heart by that priceless word liberty, and let the little sufferer go his way.
               'Who is that?' was asked by perhaps fifty persons in the court room, who stretched out their necks and opened their mouths to see the speaker as he took his seat beside the boy, and almost every lawyer's pipe had gone out. 'Yankee,' 'Yankee,' was answered by many a whisper.
               'Is he a Yankee?' was the wondering echo.
               'That was a good speech, Yankee or no Yankee' added the startled spectators.
               I must admit, that speech made a strong impression on my mind, and Col. Stout and Long both beckoned to me. Said Long. 'That was a noble thought.'
               That fellow's no fool' said Stout.
               Doubleface walked up to him and openly complimented him on his 'first effort in Smithville' My friend Black was one of the jurors. He afterwards told me he thought that was the best thing he ever heard in his life, if it was from a Yankee. That little speech, though entirely extemporaneous, made a very favorable impression on the people who were present.
               The jury fixed the boy's punishment at five day's imprisonment.
               The next cause called was the State vs. Peterson—murder. For the defence: Gen. Doubleface, Col. Stout, Col. Long, and Mr. Randolph. A jury was empanelled from the bystanders, and the trial proceeded. The evidence proved that John Peterson without any avowed object, went at night and demanded admittance into the house of two ladies—a mother and daughter—who lived on a farm in the country. They refused. He threatened to break down the door, which he proceeded to do. The ladies screamed and called to a negro man who, with his wife lived in a cabin adjoining. Peter broke open the door, in doing which, he loosened a large piece of chinking, which fell to the floor. He was inside, the ladies still screaming, when he heard the cabin door open, and the nigger man coming. He picked up the piece of chinking, ran out of the door, met the nigger coming with a pistol, struck him on the head, felled him to the ground, and then and there beat out his brains with the chinking. The evidence further proved that the prisoner had been a Confederate soldier; was arrested by the United States military, and was by them turned over to the State authorities for trial.
               The attorney for the State, Major Jenkins, said he had made out a plain case of murder, and he didn't 'care to argue it to the jury.' The defendant's counsel, however, soon showed that the attorney general was mistaken. They placed their cause on the broad ground of self-defence, and proved in the argument most conclusively that the nigger had no business there.
               'Gentlemen of the jury,' said Doubleface, 'you understand the prejudices of our people. You know how we have all been raised and educated. You know that our children are taught to look upon negroes as their inferiors; and you know further, that the Southern boy is taught from his cradle to take no impudence or threats from a negro. We whipped our own slaves when they deserved it, and it was always a custom with us that any white man or boy was at liberty to chastise any negro no matter whose he was, when he went out of his proper place and offered resistance or insult. You know we cannot and will not tolerate any interference or opposition on the part of a nigger. I say we were taught that kind of morals from our infancy. Now, this young man on trial was in a neighbor's house, for what purpose does not appear. The owners did not want him there. They called for help from a nigger to oust him from the room. If they had called to a white man, the case might have been very different; but they called to a nigger. What Southern man or boy could endure the idea of being attacked or ejected from a house by a nigger? Mr. Peterson went out and there the nigger came running toward him, with a cocked pistol ready to shoot him at any moment. What then, did Peterson do? What would you have done? What would any high-toned Southern gentleman have done? He killed him. It is as plain a case of self-defence as ever I argued to an intelligent jury, and I know that I am now addressing such.
               Besides this, gentlemen, Mr. Peterson, when his country called him to her defence, like every other true Southern boy, responded to the call by offering his life as a sacrifice upon her altar. His services must not be forgotten by our people, now that he is on trial for his life: and especially so, when, if he had not been arrested by the military power of the government, he would to-day have been as free as any of us—as he should be.'
               'The counsel is out of order,' interrupted the Judge. 'The court will not permit any such line of argument. Confine yourself to the law and facts of the case. The question is not whether the defendant was a rebel soldier, or whether he was properly arrested; but whether he is guilty of murder.'
               'Then,' said the General, with an air of triumph, 'I submit the case to the jury, who, I know will do this man justice, for they are the judges of both the law and the fact'
               Mr. Randolph made one of his most powerful arguments—eloquent, convincing and logical. His position, forced upon the jury with the eloquence of a Demosthenes, was, 'that the defendant did not only do nothing, but he could not properly have done anything else. He had acted purely in self-defence, and was compelled to kill the negro in order to save his own life.'
               The attorneys who followed took the same view. Major Jenkins in closing the case expended a great deal of learning; sawing the air in a very threatening manner with his arms, and administered a severe castigation upon his left hand by slapping it with his right; used up a great deal of innocent tobacco; but it was all to no purpose. What the impregnable positions assumed by the learned counsel for the defense, had failed to effect in the minds of the jury, the quarrel between the Judge and Gen. Doubleface had fully done. John Peterson was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and allowed a year in the penitentiary to consider his future plans.
               'The State vs. Sam Frost, col'd., larceny,' was then called, 'counsel for the defence, Hapsburg and McClintock.' Sam had stolen one of Mr. Black's pigs, supposed to weigh 150 pounds gross, worth ten dollars: Verdict, 'guilty as charged,' and punishment three years in the Penitentiary.'
               'The State vs. Pete dawson, murder, was next called. For defence, Long, Stout, Perkins, Randolph, Doubleface, and several others.' The facts were that Pete and Harry Sanders (the two gentlemen, who, at Calhoun, intended to kill Gen. Short) had been drinking a little one day on their old war paths, when Pete, in a funny and playful mood, shot his old friend Harry through the heart and killed him. Pete proved an excellent character. Many of the best citizens of the county testified to his morals, and spoke in the highest terms of his good qualities. In fact there never was a better character proved in Smithville than Pete Dawson's. My old friend Bartholomew, at whose house Pete had spent a great portion of his leisure time during the war, testified that Pete, with a few of his comrades, had given that neighborhood great protection during the war from Yankees. They frequently kept them out for months at a time. 'Pete,' he said, 'were death on Yankees, but he was a high-toned gentleman and a true friend to the people in that part of the country. He said he had frequently heard Pete say how many Yankees he had shot, but of course he did not then remember the number.'
               As the testimony concluded, Hapsburg whispered to me, 'That man was the most noted and dangerous guerrilla in all this country. I saved him from death once, simply because I could not prove by a living witness what every one knew to be true. He is a cold-blooded murderer, and Bartholomew knows it. He killed our men from ambush. He robbed Union people and burned their houses. All this Bartholomew knows, and yet he gives the villian a good character. Perhaps he is afraid of him doing mischief in case he is acquitted, which I feel safe in predicting will be done.' I made no answer to this.
               The position of the defense in this very important case was, 1st. There was no murder, for there was no malice. 2d. It was not manslaughter, because the party accused was not at the time of the shooting doing any unlawful act. 4th. It was not an assault, for there was no threat or anger and no unwillingness on the part of the deceased. 5th. It was purely an accident.
               The lawyers all charged the State's Attorney with 'thirsting for the blood of this victim of his rapacity.' This made that gentleman very angry, and in his attack upon the opposite counsel, he lost sight of his cause. Pete was duly acquitted.
               The civil docket was then taken up, and 'John Quart vs. Richard Peck,' was called. 'Breach of warranty in the soundness of a slave.'—Long and Stout for plaintiff; Moffat and Randolph for defendant. Quart had sold a slave, Bob, to Peck and warranted him to be sound. Peck sold him to Jenks with like warranty. The nigger died; Jenks claims damages from Peck, and Peck sues Quart on the breach of warranty. Bob took fits after Jenks bought him, and of these fits finally died. The testimony showed that Bob, on one occasion put a ladies' saddle on a mule wrong end behind; at another, he failed to drive a load of fodder properly and it fell off the cart; at another time, he drove a stubborn mule into the water to drink, when it ought to have gone straight on; at one time he ate too much green corn which made him very sick; at another, he looked the wrong way for the sun; at another, he did not act sensible; at still another, he put his breeches on back foremost. The warranty was fully proven. One witness was shown the bill of sale, and asked if he knew the hand writing. He examined the paper (which he held upside down,) very carefully, and said he did, for he saw 'the old man sign his name a thousand times.'
               Now on these facts was the nigger sound? We spent days in this lawsuit. It was argued by five lawyers on each side. The jury failed to agree and a miss-trial was entered.
               The next was a contested will case, where a will had been made by an old gentleman who fancied that his bowels had crept down into his legs, and to check this inconvenient tendency he had lain on his back with his feet placed as high as he could get them, for fifteen years. Could such a man make a will? Hapsburg was employed in this case, and made an argument on the nature of wills, and the competency of parties to make them, which evinced great research. Although called into the case after the jury had been sworn, he made an 'able argument'—so Long said.
               Our experience with Hapsburg and our 
                     obervation
                     observation
                   of his manner of managing a cause, I must say, in justice to him, for I think I am a jus man—brought us to respecting his ability, while we despised the man himself. That evening at tea, I remarked to Mrs. Bascom, I could see no good reason why that man would not, in time, be as highly esteemed at our bar as any one else.
               'I can give you a good reason,' she curtly replied: 'He is a Yankee. That's reason enough.'
               'Aye, that's so love' I replied, 'yes that's reason enough in Smithville.'
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               
                  Elections—Carpet-bag Opinions of a Tennessee County Court—Schools—Roads. Etc.
               
               Spring elections were at hand. By the provisions of the amended constitution of February, '65, the matter of fixing the qualifications of voters and limiting the elective franchise, was given over to the first General Assembly which should convene under the new constitution. That august body had passed a franchise law, which required every voter to be registered, and have a certificate thereof. The Clerks of the County Courts were made Commissioners of Registration. These clerks were appointed by the court, and in nine cases out of every ten, they were gentlemen selected from among our own citizens, and of course well known to our people.
               Under the administration of the franchise law by these clerks, a very large number of the citizens who were intended to be disfranchised, obtained certificates, so we were not so badly worsted in this respect as we might have been. It proved of great advantage to us in the spring elections. All our county officers throughout the State had been appointed either by Johnson, the traitor, or by Brownlow, the heathen, and it would be quite useless therefore for me to add, that in our county administration for the first year of peace, so-called, we were ruled by Radical pimps. A farce, called an election, for Governor and members of the General Assembly had been held, but that was while most of our voters were still in the army. This March election was the first since the war which had any semblance whatever of an American election. Our sheriff was a Radical, and so all over the State, but these were all homemade Radicals They had learned their creed but recently. They were converts of tender years. But we had no use for them, and we were mighty glad to know our time had come to oust them. We had no difficulty whatever in electing all our officers, for more than half our people were voters, although as I have before remarked, there were only five original Union men in the county, and one of them was hanged. It was so all over the State. A thorough revolution was effected in the political character of our higher county officials. With us, our Justices of the Peace and constables were necessarily of our way of thinking, for there were not enough of any other kind to be found in the county. If this condition of things had been permitted to continue, we would have been safe, for it matters but little what kind of laws are made, if the county officers will not execute them, and then after this spring election we were masters of the situation. Our new officers were of our own making, and therefore were just what we wanted. We could trust them.
               About this time our County Court held its first old fashioned regular term. Now we have the Circuit Court, the Chancery Court, the Supreme Court, and we have Criminal and Special courts; but the most ancient, most admired, and in many respects the most important court in Tennessee, is the County Court. We are a democratic people. We like our government to come near us, and we are a conservative people; we love the institutions of our fathers. The County Court with us is a venerable institution. That I may not be accused of over drawing our estimate of this grave body, I will here quote from the next morning's issue of the Smithville Reporter.
               'The assembling of the County Court on yesterday, was the grandest occasion of the kind ever witnessed in Smithville. While our bar can boast the finest legal talent in the State, our county enjoys no less pride in her worshipful body. On no occasion of the kind have we ever seen a more intelligent body of men assembled. The following are the names of the gentlemen composing the worshipful court.'
               And then it goes on to give the names—just forty-seven in all. I hope my readers will pardon me for saying so much of this valuable portion of our judicial system. With our people, the county was the original corporation, and from time immemorial the County Court has been our most respectable body of officials, not excepting even the General Assembly. It has charge of our roads, our ferries, our bridges, our taxes, our schools, that is our pauper public schools; and our public buildings, in which we take a great deal of pride. Its jurisdiction in judicial matters, is also very extensive. It has charge of administration, probate of wills, apprentices, paupers, bastards, and in ante bellum times, of most offences committed by slaves. Yes, its duties are responsible; its jurisdiction extensive, and its organization grand. The court is composed of the Justices of the Peace in the county. The County Court of Middlebury dlebury county is composed of just forty-seven members besides the Judge—in all forty-eight. The counties in Tennessee are divided into civil districts, (what the Yankees call townships) and each of these has two Justices of he Peace. The civil district in which the county town is located is entitled to three. In our county there are twenty-three civil districts. These send up their Magistrates—men selected by the people for their sterling qualities as citizens. In this court, therefore, the whole body of the people is represented. This is democratic, and as it should be. And then it prevents extravagance in the appropriations of our money. It prevents frauds from being practiced on the people's rights, for we can all feel secure when our county business is entrusted to so large a body of respectable men.
               Take, for instance, the item of public roads. Our Legislature many years ago wisely provided that the County Courts should have the power to open four classes of roads, as follows: 1st, Stage roads, twenty feet wide, if practicable from the situation of the ground; 2d, Roads that shall be twelve feet wide; 3d, Roads that shall be opened seven feet wide; 4th, Bridleways.' And that is our road law to-day. Now the County Court has sole jurisdiction over this whole subject. With roads of this width, if our people were taxed as they are in some of the Northern States to keep them in good condition, we could not pay our taxes.
               But our court, knowing what our ability to pay is, never appropriates a dollar for the repair of roads, unless the whole people petition for it, and every lawyer in Happy Row makes a speech in favor of it. But the lawyers don't have much influence with this court unless they are backed up by the people. I am willing to admit that our roads might be better, but still we can make out with them, for all our people understand horseback riding—indeed they prefer it—and where we can't go with buggies and wagons, we can go that way. This saves us a great deal of money.
               My friend Jones has always complained about our road system, and says in this respect we are far behind the State of New York. He insists that the sight of our roads are enough to keep out immigrants from the North forever. This may all be true, but we cannot afford to change our ancient system merely to please Zedekiah Jones. Our Carpet-baggers, too, are clamorous for 'wider and better roads.' Their desire for a change, is enough to satisfy us that a change would be highly improper. If they had power, I honestly believe they would put half the taxes of the county on the roads. But our system simply requires that the people work their own roads. Here you see, in this single instance, how valuable uable to us in our most worshipful County Court.
               And just so with schools. We have a system of public schools; have had for more than forty years. The people of Tennessee are friends of education. Our wealthy classes of course do not patronize these public schools. We have seminaries, academies, and colleges for our children, and then we generally let them finish their education in the North. No; our public schools are intended only for the poor. They are supported by State taxation. Now our County Courts, if they were so disposed, might lay burdensome taxes upon us for the benefit of these common schools.—This, with the money we are compelled to pay for the education of our own children in the academies and other select schools of the country, would be more than we could endure. To support these, and then be compelled to maintain the common schools in addition, would bankrupt the people. Here again our County Court comes wisely to our aid. No less political body than a county can levy taxes in our good old State. The Yankee system of school districts and townships levying taxes for schools and roads, can never obtain in Tennessee. The constitution is plain on that point, and besides, our Supreme Court has long ago decided it. As it is, with the State aid, sometimes these common schools are kept open a month or perhaps a little more in a year, and then they are compelled to close, unless the neighbors will continue them by subscription. How greatly this relieves the tax-payers, and yet it in no way interferes with the education of the rich man's child.
               Suppose the County Court should desire the common schools kept open for five, six or eight months in each year, and levy a tax upon the county for that purpose. It would create a revolution in forty-eight hours. If these intolerable Carpet-baggers had their way, every academy in the State would be turned into a public school house, and between them and the roads they would ruin our people. But our noble County Court is our great shield against extravagance and oppression. Thank God! it has survived the wreck of the war. Long may it live to walk in the footsteps of its fathers.
               Much more might be said in honor of this ancient institution, but possibly I have already said too much. I should not have referred to it at all, only to show what a Carpet-bagger thinks of our favorite court. I was standing with several friends, Moffat, Highflyer and Stout and some others, speaking of the origin and history of courts in general, but specially of the County Court, when Brown and Hapsburg came walking leisurely in arm in arm. They stopped ped and looked about over or rather through the crowd, for all were standing. We rarely ever have seats in our court houses, except for the lawyers and a bench or two outside the bar. After viewing the room and the people for a few seconds, they both laughed heartily, and walked toward us.
               'What do you think of our County Court?' said Moffat.
               'I was just looking for the court,' replied Brown smiling, and again he looked around.'
               'Why, there is the court,' said Moffat, pointing to the semi-circle of magistrates extending just half round the large room, and raised on a plat form some three feet above the floor
               'What! that row of men behind the railing? Is that the court? Why I thought they were spectators in the gallery.'
               He laughed heartily, and was going to add something more, when the Judge, a portly, noble looking man, arose from the center of the august court to put a motion to 'the worshipful body,' when Brown's face suddenly assumed an air of gravity, and quietly he asked, 'Is court in session?'
               'Certainly,' said Moffat, and simultaneously, the Carpet-baggers both took off their hats, and threw away their cigars. Brown proceeded to count the number of the court, and I saw him writing 'forty-seven' in his memorandum book. He then took another survey of the assemblage.
               'Why,' said he, whispering to me, 'there are just forty-one spectators, and forty-seven members of the court. This is certainly a very cumbrous body. I should think three good sensible men could do more business, do it better and with less expense. What is the pay of these magistrates?'
               Three dollars per day,' I answered. Thinking a moment, he said:
               'Three dollars per day; forty-seven times three, one hundred and forty-one dollars for one day's work for one county. That's very expensive. How often does the court meet?'
               'Four times a year,' I answered, and then, once in each month we have the Quorum court composed of three magistrates. This is the quarterly court that is now in session. This takes the place of the Quorum court for this month.'
               'Three;' said he, 'nine times three are twenty-seven, and three times twenty-seven are eighty-one. Four times one hundred and forty-one are five hundred and sixty-four, which, plus eighty-one, equals six hundred and forty-five dollars to run that machine a year.'
               'And mileage,' said I.
               'What pay does the Judge get?' he asked.
               'Just what the court allows him, about $500 per annum,' said I, 'and then he gets five dollars per day for all time he holds court, besides he gets four per cent, on all county disbursements, which runs up his salary to about $1500 to $2000 per annum.'
               'Suppose,' said Brown' 'you should abolish so cumbrous and costly a system, appoint three commissioners at a salary of say five hundred dollars, or even two hundred dollars each per year. Don't you think you could have your county business done better and a great deal cheaper? Besides, you could then apply all the surplus that you now pay to these men, three fourths of whom know nothing about the business they are to transact, to your roads and schools, which would put us in better condition to invite immigration.'
               'You very much underrate the ability of our worshipful court,' said I. 'There is only one out of the whole of that honorable body who can neither read nor write. They are all intelligent, high-toned honorable gentlemen, and I am not pleased to hear them irreverently spoken of.'
               I was a little vexed at his insult, for I felt sure it was intended as an insult.
               'I meant no disrespect,' said he. A man can speak the truth sometimes without intending offence. It's my opinion that at least three-fourths of those men could serve their county better in the corn field.'
               'I was getting angry, and I spoke somewhat bitterly. 'This, sir, is one of the institutions of our fathers; it protects us from the rapacity of just such men as you, and we are proud to know, that with this venerable, noble court between us and your revolutionary and thieving plans, we are forever secure in our ancient ways. You may hammer away at us until doomsday, but while we have this body for our protectors, we are impregnable.'
               'Yes,' said he, smiling as none but a mean, cowardly Yankee can smile, 'that's so. As long as you can hold on to that old coach, you need never fear having your necks broken on any new or better road.'
               'We want no new roads,' I quickly replied.
               'Major,' said the fool, trying to repeat some of Whittier's, Stowe's or Longfellow's slang, called poetry, 'men are quite unfit to lead, 
                     
                        Till they learn to betray.
                        Undistinguished they live if they shame not their sires,
                        And the torch that would light them to dignity's way.
                        Must he caught from the pile when their country expires.
                     
                  
               
               And he and his friend both left, laughing at our most worshipful County Court.
               This very unjust and unprovoked attack upon our most cherished tribunal vexed me, and had Hapsburg not been present, I should have resented it properly, but I did not desire to offend him at that time. But I will show here and now, by one simple illustration what both these Yankees are.
               The principal business before the court at that time was, the disposition of dead niggers, how to bury them, and who should pay the expenses, etc. Now it so happened that although the contraband camp was broken up, the great body of the niggers had gotten over their foolish fears about our remanding them again to slavery, and had gone out into the country to work the farms; but a large number still remained about the city, and the small pox was carrying them off in great numbers. The city had a pest-house and the county had none. There were also quite a large number of Kentucky niggers in our city who, because that State had not ratified the amendment to the United States constitution abolishing slavery, had come to Tennessee for safety. When any country nigger took the smallpox, he was sent at once to the city pest-house. The city authorities presented a bill to the County Court for burial expenses. The petition stated that the United States government would pay half, if the county would pay the other half.
               But the County Court said: 'No; let the city bury its own dead,' One of those old grey haired veterans who had been a magistrate for the last forty years, (Esq. Mansfield) said 'I will never vote one cent to bury a Kentucky nigger. Besides this, the 
                     governmet
                     government
                   hasn't turned our nigger over to us yet. They were stolen from us by authority of the government, and I am in favor of letting it take care of its own niggers, at any rate, until they are put under our own control, and we get pay for them. So thought the forty-seven members of that august tribunal, save Esq. Pettigrew, a native Radical, who had chanced to be appointed one of the honorable court by Brown-low. He suggested that Kentucky niggers were as liable as any others to contract small-pox; but he was not heard. Yes, who but a Yankee will not admire the noble patriotism of that court in refusing to appropriate fifty or one hundred dollars of the people's money to bury dead niggers who died in town? You may say what you please, but the County Court of Tennessee is an institution that Yankee inventions can never change unless they utterly destroy it.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               
                  Another Carpet-bagger—A Constitutional Democrat who don't drink Whisky.
               
               My daughter Sue and I were going down town to look at some new goods, which Capt. Bombast had recently ordered from New York. (I do wish we could manufacture our own goods, and not be put to the disagreable necessity of sending to the Yankees for every thing we want.) We stopped a moment to speak to Mr. Black's daughters who had just driven up to the side walk. As I saw those three beautiful young ladies in that old family carriage, two seated behind and one in front with the colored driver, I could not help reflecting how very unjust to us the Yankees are, when they say we are prejudiced against the nigger. There, that fellow sat with a blooming girl beside him, and her two sisters just behind, all belonging to the same family and in the same carriage, and no one thinking any thing wrong about it. While speaking to the young ladies: Capt. Brown, came by, in his usual haste. He raised his hat to Sue, as gallantly as ever did the boldest chevalier; and she, foolish, naughty thing, recognized his salutation.
               'Now,' said I 'Sue, let this be the last time you recognize that scoundrel, on the street.'
               'Who is he?' asked all the girls in the carriage at once.
               'He's one of the 
                     theives
                     thieves
                   who have come here to rob the niggers first and us afterwards' said I.
               'Why Sue'! Why Sue! The girls chidingly said, while Sue turned very red. And she quickly replied. 'You never received Yankee beaus, didn't you?'
               'Yes, said the girls but that was to save Pa's fine horses.'
               'And you didn't get jealous when Capt. Duane married Mollie McFlimsy, did you?'
               Now I was not much accustomed to girls love talk, at any rate not for some twenty-five years past, and I did not desire a quarrel among them here, so I proposed to change the subject by going to Mr. Burtons, and having some ice cream which was acceded to.
               The ladies were very much pleased with the polite attentions of this young gentleman, and retired speaking a great many kind words about him. I left them at Bombas's, and I went to Poole's. On my way there I met Brown.
               'Brown' said I: 'did you see those young dies with their nigger driver in that carriage?'
               'I did:' he replied.
               'Now, what do you think about southern prejudice against niggers?'
               'Oh you are not prejudiced against niggers,' he said strongly emphasising the last word. 'It is only when men with black skins assert their manhood that your prejudices are seen. Your prejudice is not against niggers, but against men who want to be free.'
               But said I: 'There you saw one lady—no better in the, county sitting on the same seat with a colored driver, while two sisters sat next behind. Don't you think we are more liberal than you after all?'
               'What would you think if you were to see a Yankee family doing the same thing?' asked he.
               'That is not the point. You Yankees are always dodging the main question' I said. 'Answer what I have asked.'
               'We Carpet-baggers are not fond of discussing these matters,' said he: 'We would much prefer to be silent lookers on, and go to making money and redeeming the country.'
               'But,' said I, 'I insist on your answering my 
                     questton
                     question
                  .' 'Are we not more liberal with the nigger than you?'
               'Yes, I think you are' said he. 'You have used them and their children to do your menial work for two hundred years, and have been so liberal in your attentions to them that you have well nigh destroyed the ancient color of their skins.'
               'What do you mean sir?' I asked in excitement.
               'I simply mean that one half the slaves of the south in 1861, had white blood in their veins.'
               'Do you mean to charge us with amalgamation?' I asked stepping up closer to him and grasping tighter my cane.
               'No sir,' said he smiling, I charge it on the inferior race. You are not getting blacker but they are getting whiter.'
               You infamous scoundrel!' said I. 'You can never converse with a gentleman without insulting him.'
               I tried to avoid the matter' said he as cool as a May morning.
               'But I insisted on your answering my question;' said I, and I expected a satisfactory reply.
               'You can't look that little boy behind you in the face and say I have not told the truth,' he said mockingly.
               I looked behind me, and there stood Betty's oldest boy, with a note which he handed me, and ran off. That boy has very straight hair.
               While I was reading the note Brown passed on. McCarty wished to see me. I went without delay. There was a stranger with him. A young man of perhaps twenty-four years, with a bright, intelligent face. He was introduced to me as 'Mr. John D. Roorback of Indiana, a young gentleman who had recently come among us to take a look at our country, and was reading law in the office of Judge Brown.' Tom added 'he is a constitutional democrat, and he must be introduced to our young men.'
               'Certainly' said I, and at once took him over to Happy Row. I had all the young lawyers collected together in a few minutes in my office, and sent Bob for five bottles of champagne. But I found the young man had been introduced to all of them already by Hapsburg. The Champagne came, but to my utter 
                     astonisment
                     astonishment
                  , the fellow would not taste a drop.
               'Why,' said he, 'Major Bascom, I don't know how whisky tastes. I never drank a drop of it in my life.
               'But this is not whisky,' I said. 'It is much better, and brought especially for your benefit. Take some.'
               'No;' he said politely. 'If I never take the first drink, I will never get drunk.'
               'You must not drink too much,' said I. 'You must always be on your guard. A little will do no harm. I do not approve of over drinking myself, but a little won't do any one harm. Have some,' I said again, holding him a glass and the bottle. But he was obstinate. He thanked me, but would not drink.
               'Well' said I, 'You are the first Constitutional Democrat I ever saw who would not drink whisky. What then will you drink.'
               'Water is good enough for me,' he replied.
               We spent an hour in conversation, but our own boys had to drink the champagne. He would not even smoke a cigar, nor did he swear. We learned that he had been opposed to the war against the South; thought slavery was right, and in less than twenty years Southern independence would be achieved. He was very severe on the Radicals of the North, but strange to say, he did not speak of them as traitors, and thieves, as we do, but as men whose political views, though honest, were mistaken, and would yet endanger the perpetuity of constitutional government. He looked for the South to preserve our liberties if they were preserved at all.
               Why, thought I, this is a decent fellow, if he ain't trying to deceive us. And I asked him how it happened that when he was a democrat and friend of the South, he could read law in the office of such an abolitionist as Brown.
               'Oh' answered he. 'We are taught in the North to respect every man's opinions. We think no less of people there because they do not agree with us in sentiment. That would be subversive of all liberty, and we are all freemen there.'
               But, said I, 'suppose you owned a hundred niggers, and I thought they ought to be set at liberty, would you associate with me?'
               'Its none of my business what you think. If you undertook to steal my niggers, then I would punish you. But what you think, is not my concern.'
               'Do you know,' said I, 'that we don't respect people here who associate with abolitionists and radicals, any more than we do the thieves themselves?'
               'I have so understood, and I don't blame you. I think if I had been raised in the South, I would have felt just that way.'
               'Mr Roorback,' said my young friend, Andrew Phipps, 'I am glad Major Bascom has introduced that subject. We are your friends, because we have good reason to believe you are ours; and we don't desire that you should suffer from want of information which it is in our power to convey. You have been calling on the Misses Ferguson, have you not?'
               'Yes,' he replied I spend some time in their society. They seem to be very 
                     intellgent
                     intelligent
                  , modest ladies.'
               'Are you aware that they received Yankee officers at their house during the war?'
               'No;' said he. Nor do I care. That is not my business. They are well behaved, all of them, and they reside near Mr. McClintocks residence, where I board.'
               'Yes;' said Phipps: 'They were educated here; they are intelligent, modest, well behaved girls, but they are utterly discarded from our society, and you must not visit them any more if you expect to be introduced to any of our young ladies.'
               'I will take your advice;' said he. 'The thing is all wrong, but I don't blame you. You were raised in the South.'
               After some further friendly conversation among the young men in which it was agreed to have a moot court instituted for the benefit of the young lawyers. Roorback asked:
               'Have you any public libraries, lectures, lyceums, reading rooms, or anything of that kind here?'
               'None' said Phipps. 'But we will have a bran-dance next Saturday night, and a ball at the Dixie Hotel. Can you dance?'
               'No:' but I can skin the wild cat—can turn a summerset and throw six balls.'
               'By the way,' said Jimmy Dobbs, 'are you fond of gymnastic exercises?'
               'Very,' said Roorback.
               'Then let me show you our gymnasium,' and the young gentlemen left me, each with a cigar in his mouth and a neat cane in his hand, save the hoosier, who had both hands deep in his pockets.
               We watched the course of this young man very closely. We found him consistent in all his professions. He was very modest, rarely ever speaking to any one, unless spoken to, and then his answers were precise and to the point. He soon became a great favorite with the young men at the gymnasium, and moot court. His manner was pure, but rather bashful and retired. He never used profane or vulgar language. I saw him at a Sabbath school picnic once. He had come with Hapsburg and children. But no one spoke to either of them when it could be avoided. They spent their time together and alone the whole of the day, except when they were amusing the children by working their swings for them. This young man was a model in the way of purity of morals and department. He spent some six months with us, during which time he became acquainted with all our young men worth knowing; but, and I am really ashamed to say it, not one of them ever called on him at his boarding place, or invited him to their homes, or introduced him into female society. The only ladies he knew were the Misses Ferguson, and he was introduced to them by the Yankees. He was fond of the society of ladies, too. I remember once he came into my office, which he frequently did when he desired some advice about social matters, and sitting down beside me, began in his usual abrupt manner:
               'Major Bascom, who is that beautiful young lady dressed in green, who occupies pew No. 13 in your church? I have seen her there every Sabbath since I came to Smithville, and I must say that I would like to become acquainted with her. She is the very picture of health. Her cheeks are as full and red as a fall apple; and what beautiful white teeth. She always has two little sisters with her. Do you know her?'
               'Oh, yes,' said I, laughing, 'I am very well acquainted with the lady you describe. But I think her daughter much handsomer than she.'
               The poor fellow almost dropped off his chair.
               'Why, is she married?' he impatiently asked.
               
               'No; not now,' I answered. Her husband died some years ago. She is a widow.'
               'How old is she?' he asked.
               'I really don't know. Ladies, it is said, do not tell their ages.'
               'Is her daughter as handsome as she?'
               'Yes, I think so. She and her husband sit in the next pew behind her mother and the little girls.'
               He sat and looked me full in the face for some seconds, as though he doubted the truth of what I was saying.
               "Who then are those little girls?" he asked.
               "Her grand children" said I, scarcely able to restrain my laughter.
               "Her grand children?!" he asked, his astonishment increasing, and his large gray eyes staring wildly at me. "Her grand-children! What makes her cheeks so red then?"
               "My dear fellow," said I, 'you hav'nt learned all yet. Our Southern ladies keep themselves looking young at church 
                     and and
                     and
                   on the street, and in the ball-room or theatre until they are fifty and upwards.'
               'But how the mischief do they do it?' he asked.
               'They paint' said I, 'they paint and powder.'
               'Then,' said he rising from his chair, 'give me the Hoosier girl, whose face wears a natural bloom, and whose heart is too pure to cheat the passer-by with adornments of the druggists arts,' and he left me, while I laughed immoderately.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               
                  The Carpet-baggers in Politics.
               
               The great contest between the President and Congress, was giving us great concern. We were thinking much better of Andy. He was beginning to exhibit some indications of a return to the principles of his early education. There might be hope for him yet, and through him for the country. Who could tell? At all events it was to our interest, as we thought, to take advantage of every opportunity afforded us to strengthen our position. The question of ratifying the 14th amendment to the United States Constitution was before the people. Our Legislature was called in extraordinary session for that purpose. Congress said ratify; the people said so. Of course we were with the President. Now, we despised Andy Johnson, and do to-day, from the very bottom of our hearts. But here was a good opportunity to use him to a good purpose and we thought we would embrace it.
               It was all important to us in Smithville that we knew just what course he Carpet-baggers would take. It was therefore decided in Happy Row that I make that matter my special business. Time also was important, and I set out on my exploring expedition at once. I first called on McClintock & Brown. (These Yankees are a polite people in some respects.) They received me very cordially. I began to talk about the crops, the weather, business, trade, and everything I could think of, save the object of my call. I was very anxious to let them begin the conversation on politics, but they did not appear to be thinking on that subject at all. I finally suggested there was a probability of the Legislature being called together soon.
               'Yes, so I see by the last paper,' said McClintock. 'It is warm weather for a session now.'
               'What course are you gentlemen going to take in regard to the amendment?' I asked.
               
               'Well,' said Brown, 'we had not thought of the matter at all. We are not troubling our heads about politics. We have something to do which we deem more profitable.'
               'Don't you intend advising the Legislature?' I asked.
               'Oh, no; it is fair to presume that the Legislature knows its business.'
               McClintock then added, 'If the Legislature of Tennessee does not know enough to ratify that amendment without debate, it had better not assemble. That amendment is a political necessity, and not a Southern State will be restored until it is adopted. I want Tennessee restored immediately, her representatives admitted, and the people set on their feet again. This won't be done till the Legislature ratifies the amendment. Therefore, I say it should be done at once.'
               'I rather doubt the propriety of ratifying,' said I cautiously. 'Would it have the effect to put the nigger above the white man?'
               'Not if the white man behaves himself as well as the nigger,' said Brown.
               Confound that fellow Brown. He is always driving some hit at me, and yet he is so good natured about it that I can't strike him. So I was thinking, when he added:
               'If you gentlemen here would pay no more attention to politics than we, you would not have half so much to fret you.'
               'Why so,' I asked.
               'Because the less you interest yourself by active efforts, the more contented you would be in the first place, and in the second place, the more liberal the Legislature would be. The first franchise law was liberal. More than half the people could vote under it. At the very first election, you turned out of office every Union man in the State whose office was to be filled at the time, and elected men who were not friends to the government either State or national. This created alarm in the Legislature, and a second law was passed restricting the right of suffrage to such an extent, that I doubt if twenty-five men in this county can take the necessary oath to entitle them to vote. I very much hope the people will not goad the government into extreme measures.'
               'Don't you think Brownlow a tyrant?' I asked.
               'Not if he has loyal people to govern,' said he.
               McClintock added: 'Brownlow is hardly the man for the times, but we can make him a good governor, if we will but be quiet, and not provoke him to revenge. To use an old army expression, we must not rile him.'
               I was not a fool. At least I did not think so. I flattered myself that I fully understood the way the wind blew in that quarter, and I was about to take a pinch of snuff, and leave, when to my surprise and mortification, on looking round, I saw the well known old white hat of Jake Prim. Taking a seat without any ceremony whatever, and pulling out his twist, knife, and pipe, while cutting away at the tobacco so as to let the pieces drop in the hollow of his left hand, without looking at any one, he began:
               'Are you Yanks going to attend the meetin?'
               'What meeting?' said McClintock.
               'We're goin to have a h—l of big meeting Saturday to instruct old Poodles to vote against that nigger amendment.'
               'You interminable old fool,' said I, turning full upon him, most heartily disgusted with his impertinence, for he was always spoiling something. 'What do you know about any meeting? Who has required you to publish news of things before they have occurred? There is no meeting at all, gentlemen; there is no meeting appointed for any such business. This man Prim is always meddling with matters which don't concern him. There's no such meeting at all.'
               'Bascom,' said the old dunce, lighting his match, 'You're an ass.'
               'I rose quickly up, and raising my cane, said to him, 'You old wretch, if it were not for your grey hairs, I should wear this cane out over your head.'
               Apparently paying no attention whatever to what I had said, but sucking away at his pipe, to which he was now applying his lighted match, between sucks, answered:
               'If it'll (suck—puff—suck) be any satisfaction to you (puff—puff) Major, whale away. I don't fight any (suck—puff—puff) more, but I'd as soon see you try your (puff—puff) hand as not.'
               Then taking his pipe, which now seemed to be out, from his mouth, and looking full at Brown, the old fool added:
               'Yes, it's all fixed. I've just come from the Row, and it's all fixed. The meetin's goin to come off, and if you Yanks don't come out and show your hand, and show it right, down goes your house. That was a d—d big war, but we aint flaxed yet. If the court knows herself, and she thinks she does, we can manage a couple of Yankees yet. It's going to be d—d hot for Yankees here arter while,' and standing in the door with his face outward, long enough to rekindle his pipe, he slowly walked away, calling to Hippenhammer across the street to let the people in his neighborhood know about the meeting.
               What could I do under the circumstances? I reflected for a moment, and thought it best to say that Prim was insane, when McClintock remarked:
               'Mr. Prim is a kind of political barometer. I have found him a very accurate index of public opinion here on several previous occasions.'
               This blocked my game, and taking up my hat, I suddenly departed, saying, however, before I left, 'He is an old fool.'
               'Not so much fool as he might be,' I heard Brown say as I was getting on to the street.
               I then went to Hapsburg's office. I found him as pleasant as ever. I thought I could afford to go into my subject at once with him. So I began:
               'Hapsburg, what's your opinion of the new amendment proposed?'
               'Well, really,' said he 'I have not thought much about it. It is not my intention to mix in politics if I can avoid it, and therefore I pay no more attention to passing events than merely to inform myself of what is going on. I suppose it has been duly considered by the Congress, and therefore the presumption is, it is all well enough.'
               This was not what I had called to hear, and therefore was a little disappointed. I made another effort.
               'Do you think our Legislature will ratify it? I asked.
               'Yes, I think they will,' Said he. 'The loyal people of Tennessee reorganized our State government before the war closed and all our civil machinery is in full play. We are a State now, as much as we ever were. We have elected our Representatives to Congress—all men who are ready to take the oath of office. I hold that we are entitled to representation without conditions. I care nothing about the amendment itself. But the principle of representation is too important to be trifled with. 'After our congressmen are admitted then I have no questions to ask about the adoption of the amendment itself. I believe the State of Tennessee is entitled to her proper representation, and the Congress has no right to impose conditions. In this respect she is not like Mississippi or Alabama. They made no effort at reorganization until the war was over. They are properly under the control of Congress. But not so with Tennessee. Therefore, I say on principle, Congress has no lawful right to exact any conditions of us, and until our Representatives are recognized. I would not adopt any amendment to the constitution.'
               I was at a loss to account for the difference of opinions between these Yankees. They all recognized the legality of what was called the State government of Tennessee—something that we never did, but still two were for ratification and one against. But it made no difference to us what their reasons were, if we could but induce one of them to come out publiclylicly against ratification. The idea of the loyal men of Tennessee organizing the government, and therefore having a right, etc., was all balderdash to us. We could never swallow that. But what I wanted as, to get Hapsburg out in public against his fellow Yankees. So I tried again.
               'I take you to be an honest man and a candid one. What you say in private on political matters, you of course would have no objection to repeating in public?'
               'I would prefer taking no public part in politics whatever. I have but recently located here; I am an entire stranger to most of the people as a civilian, and therefore think it best not to meddle in politics until I know more of the people, and they know more of me.'
               'Our people know more of you than you suppose, and I am quite free to say that they look upon you very favorably. They say you were just in your official conduct when stationed here as Provost Marshal, and they remember you very kindly I have been recently informed by the parties themselves, of repeated acts of kindness on your part towards them, and a very general impression prevails that you can be trusted. I know our people would be pleased to have you assume a leading part in our politics. You have influence and we have none. We have concluded to have a public meeting in the Court House next Saturday, on purpose to instruct our Representative, Mr. Poodles, not to vote for the proposed amendment. We would be highly pleased to have you attend that meeting.'
               'I will attend the meeting,' said he, 'but I do not desire to take part in the proceedings.'
               'Think the matter over,' 'said I, 'until I see you again,' and I left him.
               I went to see Long and Doubleface, and reported my adventures. I related at length Hapsburg's views on the matter of a handful of men—loyal men having the right to organize a government, and making it binding on the whole people.'
               'That fellow is a lawyer' said Long. 'If I were a Union man, I would hold the same opinion. Of course that is all stuff to us. But will he come out?'
               'I don't know,' I answered. 'I'll fetch him out,' said Doubleface. Let him think about it until to-morrow morning, and I will call on him. I'll bring him.'
               'Take care you don't get your fingers burnt with that Yankee,' coolly remarked Stout, who had just come in. 'He is the sharpest of the pile.'
               'The burnt fingers will be on the other man's hand by the time we're done with him,' said Doubleface; and I left the office.
               As I stepped out of the door. I heard the report of a pistol, and considerable noise down street. I walked ed down to know what was going on. As I turned into Market street, I saw Pete Dawson on his horse riding about the streets, flourishing a large navy revolver, and swearing in the drunkard's braggadocio, that he was ready to meet the Yanks and all mankind in general. He proposed to wage a war of extermination against Yankees and niggers.
               I 
                     thougt
                     thought
                   possibly he might create some disturbance, and it would be well for me not to be present. Therefore I went back to my office. But the citizens were not taking any notice of his warlike demonstrations, and there were a great many people in town, for it was County court day. I soon heard another report, and I suggested that some of his friends had better take him off the streets. But Pete was a general favorite—a man of unusually good character,—no proven in court before a jury of his peers, and of course no one was in any danger on his account. However, before leaving the city, he managed to pick a quarrel with little Pat O'Brien, an Irish lad of whom Pete demanded something which Pat had no authority to give, and he shot at Pat, but missed him. He then remounted his horse and rode out of town with a friend or two. Pete had evidently been drinking some that day.
               The next morning, in company with Gen. Doubleface, I called on Capt. Hapsburg again.
               'Has your opinion undergone any change in relation to the part we desire you to take in our meeting,' I asked.
               'None,' said he, dropping his pen, and turning toward us, pointing to seats. 'I have no desire to push myself forward as a mouthpiece of the people; at any rate until I have had a longer residence among them, and become more thoroughly identified with the material interests of the country. I have not even a home of my own here yet.'
               'Capt. Hapsburg,' said Gen. Doubleface, 'there is an opening in this country for just such a man as you. Our people think well of you, and you can make yourself immortal in their memories if you will but come out in their behalf. The time is ripe for action. Our people are very much disposed to listen to men who are supposed to know how the government pulse beats. If you begin right, you can't help but rise. I know what I say. We insist on your coming out to our meeting and making a speech.'
               'Gentlemen,' he replied, 'you may not be satisfied with my opinions after all.'
               'We believe you to be liberal and honest, and that is all we ask,' said the General. 'If you want to be friendly with us you now have an opportunity to prove your faith by your works. Will you go?'
               Hapsburg studied a moment, and began to write rapidly. When he finished, he said, 'If you will endorse this resolution in the meeting, I will attend and present it,' and he read as follows:
               Resolved, That in time of civil war, in a government like ours, whenever in any state a portion of the people who have remained faithful in their allegiance to the central power, meet together and reorganize their state in harmony with the General Government, that portion of the people, however small, may lawfully be recognized by the federal head as the people of that state, so far as the purposes of government are concerned, and are entitled to representation in Congress, without further conditions. Will you endorse that?'
               'Certainly,' said Doubleface. 'We are not particular about abstractions. And then that question has been settled by the war, and we are bound to acquiesce in it whether we think it correct or not.'
               'But will your people endorse it?' He doubtingly asked.
               'Our people will do any thing we tell them to do, said the General.
               'Will you tell them to do it?' He asked again.
               'Yes:' and we separated.
               The General and I stopped a moment in front of Stout's office to consult, when McCarty came walking rapidly by and asked hurriedly: 'Have you seen Brown any where lately? There's a drunk nigger riding through the streets down here, and it is creating a good deal of excitement. He is one of Brown's old soldiers, and I want him to take the nigger away.'
               We started with him to hunt Brown. When we reached Market street, there, sure enough, was the nigger on one of Bill Sloan's Livery horses riding about the streets tight, and talking to every other nigger he saw. He rode first to one side of the street, and then to the other; and seemed to be the happiest nigger in the world. He had no firearms of any kind, and had not said a word to any white man. But we were not accustomed to seeing niggers riding about our streets. It excited our people. Crowds were collecting on the side walks, and threats were being freely made. But we suddenly came up with Brown.
               'Brown,' said McCarty: 'Look at that nigger. Our people can't stand that.'
               'What's the nigger doing?' he asked.
               'Why don't you see?' said Tom. 'He's riding about the streets.'
               'Let him ride,' said Brown: 'he paid for his horse, for I saw him do it.'
               'But he must get off the streets, our people won't tolerate it.'
               
               'Your people tolerated Pete Dawson yesterday, a notorious guerilla a thief and murderer, who rode through the streets flourishing a navy revolver and firing it off occasionally for 
                     amusment
                     amusement
                  , to the great danger of life. You tolerated that, I guess you can tolerate this;' and the beast walked away as though there was no danger of trouble near.
               Just as he left, I saw Hapsburg coming. McCarty approached him and demanded that he get that nigger away, for he certainly would bring on trouble. Our people could not endure every thing.
               If it is offensive to you, I will ask him to go away' said Hapsburg coolly—and he walked over to the niggr.
               'Sam,' said he, 'you are a good looking horseman. I wish you would ride up the street towards the livery stable till I see your horse move.' Sam straightened himself up and started in the direction indicated. Hapsburg followed on the side walk behind until they had passed the crowd. He then had some talk with him, but no one heard what was said. Sam went on to the stable, and that was the last we saw of him that day.
               Saturday came. We had our meeting. We endorsed and unanimously adopted Hapsburg's resolution. He made a speech in which he intimated that he thought Tennessee politics was running wild. We cheered him. He said there was danger of the Brownlow party going too far. We shouted applause. The people spoke in his favor, and after the meeting adjourned, we all congratulated him. Doubleface observing, 'Captain we must have you in the Senate next year,' to which he smilingly replied, 'Gentlemen, I did not come here for office.'
               It was evident he was gaining favor with the country people. And to be plain about it, we began to fear the demonstration in his favor was too real and correct for our purposes.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               
                  Story of a Yankee Cat—Revenge—Ladies Opinions—Politics—Love—Good Manners.
               
               My wife had just returned from a visit to Memphis. She had not received the treatment there which in her opinion, was due her position in society, and her political opinions. It is charged by the people of the North, that Southern women are mere dolls, and have no opinions of their own. This is a grave mistake. It does our noble ladies great injustice. They trouble themselves little about that kind of nonsense which is so profusely disseminated in New England, and generally in the Northern States. The Atlantic Monthly is not read here.—Neither is the Independent or Tribune. Those unmeaning words progress, civilization, reform, etc., are only used here for purposes of reproach and contempt for the persons who harp so much upon them.
               But I say our ladies have opinions, and very tenacious ones too. They are often even fastidious. There are three leading subjects on which their opinions are fixed. On these they are well versed; and are at all times ready to discuss them with any well bred person. Politics, Love and Good Manners. These great heads of all that pertains to the sphere of womanly virtues, are with them, the chief topics of thought and conversation.
               I was led to these remarks by reflecting over the conversation at our breakfast table the morning after the meeting spoken of in the last chapter. Mrs. Bascom is very sensitive on the subject of good manners, and her treatment at Memphis had affected her some. She has a high appreciation of all that pertains to good breeding, and hence, any little inattention to her feelings or position, is quickly discovered, and properly resented. Noble Mrs. Bascom.
               'I never was more disgusted.' said she, 'than with those miserable, nasty Yankees at that hotel. Before we reached Memphis, I asked the clerk of the boat to direct me to a good hotel where there were no Yankees to annoy me. He said he was well acquainted in Memphis, and as he too had great aversion to Yankees, he always took his meals when there, at the Lee House, where Yankees were never received. He offered to show me there, which kindness I of course gladly accepted. But I hadn't been there five minutes, till I felt it was a Yankee house. I could smell the Yankee everywhere. On the table in the room to which I was shown, there were lying three copies of Harper's Weekly, one Independent, two Atlantic Monthlies and a copy of Beecher's sermons. I rang the bell at once violently. I told the servant I wished to see the proprietor. He came, and very politely inquired what I wished. Said I, is this a Yankee house?'
               'No madam,' he answered, 'I am a native Tennesseean. I employ none but Southern born servants, and conduct the house purely on Southern principles.'
               'But,' said I, what do those books and papers mean on that table?'
               'Oh,' said he, 'I suppose they were left there by the lady who occupied the room for a few days, and left this morning.'
               'Who was she?' I asked.
               'Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe,' he replied.
               'What! that unchained hyena who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin?'
               'The same,' said he smiling.
               'I thought you kept the house in Southern style. Is that Southern style to receive such a woman as she is into your house?.'
               'But I was not 
                     awrre
                     aware
                   who she was until after she had engaged rooms.'
               'Why didn't you turn her out at once?'
               'That would not be gentlemanly to turn a well behaved lady out of doors.'
               'Have you any Yankees in the house now?'
               'Yes, a very genteel family from Ohio, who are stopping over for the eastern-bound train. They are going to Middle Tennessee to purchase land and settle there.'
               'Then,' said I, 'I won't stay in your house any longer. Will you tell me, sir, where I can find a house that don't keep Yankees?'
               'I cannot madam. We all keep our houses to make money, and a Yankee's money is as good as any other person's. Every respectable house in the city is glad to take all the transient custom it can get, and ask no questions. But most of us refuse to take regular Yankee boarders. This family will be gone to-morrow morning.'
               'Well, then,' said I, 'you must give me another room. I can't sleep here.'
               'Certainly,' said he, 'and he rang the bell for a servant.'
               'Now, don't give me a room which was ever tenanted by a Yankee,' I demanded.
               He showed me to No. 24. Just across the hall was the Ohio family. They had two little girls—real nice little things—and a baby. They seemed to have an immense wardrobe. There was a melodeon in the room, and the eldest girl—about nine years old, I suppose—played well, and both of them sang to the music. The woman wore a dark, small figured calico dress, and had her hair done up very plain. I wanted another room, but Mr. Pinkerton told me the house was full, and there was but this room left, if I would not accept the other.
               So there I was right in sight of those wretches. It was too bad. But I couldn't help myself. The little girls came over into my room—I had to keep the door open it was so warm—to show me their cat—a beautiful maltese cat—which they said they had brought from Ohio, and were going to take it to Tennessee to live. I told them I was busy and did not want to be pestered. They went out, staring at me as though I was some heathen image, and I heard them saying to their mother—for I stood at the side of the door to listen—'Why, ma, that lady looked so cross at us. Is she a Tennessee lady?'
               'Well, dears, you should never go into a strange lady's room until you are invited in.'
               'But, ma,' said one of them, we wanted to show billy to her.' 'Poor Billy, poor Billy,' both the young ones said, at once walking across the room, patting and stroking the cat.
               I was mad to think I had to be penned up there all day and night, just beside a nest of live Yankees, but I determined I should have some revenge on them if I could. Late in the evening the father and girls left the room, dressed for a walk. They left the cat behind. It was nearly dusk. The mother left her room a few minutes. The cat came walking leisurely into my room, purring as innocently as our own Tommy. Now, thought I, is my time. I caught the cat by the neck, and flung it out of the window of my room, which was on the third story. I heard it fall on the brick below, and give a kind of squall, but that was the last. I got that much revenge out of them any way. The girls went nearly crazy about the cat, and I know they did not sleep any that night, for they kept me awake with their crying, and talking about 'Poor Billy.' I always will believe that fellow on the boat was a Yankee, and the landlord, too. But I got some revenge. In the morning I saw the cat lying dead just where it fell.'
               We were all very much interested in this cat story, and listened to it attentively. Upon its conclusion, Sue observed that she thought 'Ma was too much prejudiced against Yankees; there are some good ones among them. There is Judge Brown——'
               'Stop now,' said her mother, I don't want to hear another word about that Brown. Just because he walked home with you through that crowd of niggers to prevent your being insulted, and then because he tipped his hat to you at the carriage, you must talk about his being a gentleman—a gentleman.'
               I never will forget the contemptuous expression of her countenance when she pronounced the word gentleman. Oh! if I could put on such face, I'd never be compelled to buy another quart of vinegar. I could frighten the very bats out of my barn at night. But she continued:
               'Don't tell me that any Yankee can be a gentleman. I have seen too much of their dirty, low flung conduct. Look at Harry Burton, if you want to see a gentleman. He is a Kentuckian, a high toned Southern gentleman. Compare him with your nasty, stinking Yankees, will you?'
               'But he is mine, Ma,' broke in Fanny, our second daughter. 'Let Sue have her Yankee if she wants him. I'll have the Kentuckian.'
               Sue, poor girl, put up her napkin to her face, and left the table, saying 'I don't want to marry him, but I do think it too bad to speak so of any gentleman, and I know he is a gentleman.'
               'Sue!' said her mother, her eyes following the poor girl out of the dining-room, 'don't you ever use that word gentleman in my hearing again, when speaking of a thieving, low-lived Yankee. Why there isn't honor enough in ten millions of them after it was all extracted, to fill a mustard seed. A gentleman indeed! it is so disgusting.'
               She was going to add something, but the door bell rang violently, and a man's voice—'Be quick!'—rushed on our ears. Fanny ran to the door. It was Brown.
               'There's fire bursting out of your roof—where's the stairway?' he asked quickly, but not waiting for reply, rushed past Fanny and all of us, bounding up the stairway with a great stick of cord wood, saying as he went, 'Send up water, quick.'
               We were alarmed and greatly confused. My wife wrung her hands, ran everywhere but where she could do good, and called frantically to me: 'Do follow that Yankee, and don't let him steal anything.' I called the servants, ordered water, and went up stairs as fast as I could, but Fanny was already ahead of me with two pitchers of water which had been sitting on the breakfast table. Brown had a hole punched through the roof by the time I found where he was, and with coat off, was pelting out the flames bursting out from the shingles. Bob came, out of breath, with two buckets of water, which he handed out to Brown, and the fire was soon extinguished. Brown, looking about and examining where the fire had originated, satisfying himself there was no further danger, looked at me and coolly said: 'Five minutes more, and the fire would have been beyond our control. Have you any fire engines in the city?'
               'No, sir,' said Fanny, whom he now recognized, and making a slight bow, added: 'There's no further danger now,' and taking up his coat, started down stairs.
               'Thank you,' said Fanny. But he was on the stairs. I went to repeat her expression, and there at the foot of the stairs stood Sue and Betty with a bowl of water and a towel.
               'Will you wash your hands?' asked Sue.
               'Thank you,' replied Brown. 'I am truly glad I saw your danger in time to be of service. A very few minutes more, and the house would have been destroyed.'
               He dried his hands, put on his coat, and bowing to her, walked to ward the door. Sue followed him to the steps, and all I could hear was, 'we are under many obligations to you. You have been very kind.'
               'I simply did my duty,' he answered, not pausing in his gait, and was gone.
               After making myself quite certain there was no further danger of fire, I took my cane and walked out. I heard a noise on the streets and several pistol shots fired. Hurrying on, I found a great crowd gathered in front of Poole's, and most intense excitement prevailing. Billy Ward had been drinking some, and knocked a nigger off the street with a brick-bat. The nigger resented it, when Billy shot him. Some other niggers seeing it, came running to assist their sable brother. This aroused our people, and nothing saved a very bloody riot, but the cool interference of McClintock, Brown, and the Bureau man who pacified the niggers and took them away. If Billy Ward had been touched by a nigger, there is no telling how many dead niggers would have been in the hands of the Bureau sexton the next day. Our people can't stand such things. And to add to the general feeling of disquiet on the nigger question, the Legislature at Nashville had recently passed an act permitting niggers to testify in our courts. This excited a great deal of very just indignation, and we were all tender and easily exerted on the subject. A nigger school house was burnt that night, but of course I don't know who did it. I suppose it was done by the Yankees in order to make political capital at the North.
               The civil rights bill, also and the last Freedmen's Bureau bill, had been passed by Congress, and our people were very indignant. This feeling was very general. It was showing itself in many places, and in more ways than one.
               Long, Stout and myself were consulting about the condition of public sentiment, and the danger of an outbreak somewhere to our disadvantage, when Hapsburg came into the office and read a letter which he said he had just received from Col. Wadsworth worth, of Mississippi county. The Colonel spoke of a very unsatisfactory and inflamatory state of things in that county, and thought Hapsburg, because of his liberal, and yet strict Union politics, could do good by way of allaying excitement and harmonizing public opinion. Hapsburg asked our advice about the matter, for he said he doubted his ability to meet the case. He was in the habit of conferring with us about all such things, and had got far enough along to act on our suggestions. We told him to go. I remember Long's quaint observation: 'You have sense enough, but you are too modest. Go and pitch into these Radicals. Give them a little old fashioned thunder.'
               Hapsburg, smiling and blushing, said, 'I sometimes manufacture a little lightning, but rarely any thunder.'
               He went and spent two weeks in that and neighboring counties. Col. Wadsworth said he did a great amount of good. He was a middle man,' the Colonel wrote to our city paper, 'between extremes.' He put the people to thinking and convinced them that, the less public excitement there was the better for all parties. He advised the people to submit to the laws, whether they were right or wrong, until we could be relieved in a peaceful and legitimate mode from any that we thought harsh or unwise.' The Colonel congratulated us on having so good a man as Hapsburg in our midst. This man Wadsworth was what the Yankees call a reconstructed rebel. He was ready for any thing the Yankee government might dictate; for,' said he, 'further resistance is useless. Let us submit.'
               But the Colonel was not posted at that time. We soon got him all right again, when he called at Happy Row.
               This thing of a nigger being made a witness, gave us a very considerable degree of trouble. We had not been accustomed to anything of the kind. The bare thought of it was disgusting. Why, no white man or woman's life or character would be safe if a nigger was permitted to swear in court. In consultation among ourselves, we could name innumerable cases where our very best citizens—high toned gentlemen—could be ruined, if these brutes of niggers were allowed to tell all they know. It vexed us; it alarmed us. We had only one remedy left—the juries. Yes we still had the juries with us. Then we were safe. In order to give my readers some correct idea of the general antipathy of our native people on the subject of negro testimony, I will quote from a speech delivered by a Radical candidate for Congress among the Cumberland mountains about a year before the law was passed. 'Fellow citizens' said the honorable gentleman,' Just think of the idea of a big buck niggah, with toes spraddled out like gig-prongs, with cracks in his heels that you could put a bolt of calico in, coming up and swearing away the lives of the loyal white people of East Tennessee. Fellow-citizens, the thing is too awful to contemplate. I am opposed to the niggah's swearing and voting. Wilson is the daddy of niggah equality in Tennessee. Look at him. Don't you see the wool in his teeth?'
               I quote from this gentleman's speech, because I might otherwise be thought partial and unjust. We rebels are sometimes accused of things which are natural to our whole people, and ought not therefore to be charged wholly on one class. We don't any of us, Radical or rebel, who are native and to the manor born, believe in niggers having any rights but those of a slave. They are not fit for anything else. Look at Brownlow before the war. No better friend had slavery than he. He went to the bottom of the thing. He believed in slavery because it was right—right in itself, and he proved it from the Bible. His opinion was that of the whole people of Tennessee, and the war hasn't changed that opinion. Some men will do anything for office. But you can't change the cherished opinions of a century in five or six years. In a few more years, you will see how much Tennesseeans think of niggers.
               On the day of Hapsburg's return from Mississippi county, one of our most highly esteemed citizens, Gen. Bastion, died. He was a member of the Smithville bar, and was justly distinguished in the Supreme Court and throughout Tennessee. At his funeral Brown, McClintock, Hapsburg and every Yankee in town was present. Brown, for decency's sake, was made one of the pall-bearers. This is merely mentioned to show how anxious the Carpet-baggers seemed to be to get into our society.
               Our colleges were opening at this time under the superintendence of accomplished gentlemen. Professor North had been engaged for some months in cleaning and repairing the female college. He had published a card, notifying the people that the 'institution would resume its regular sessions, and the corps of lady teachers were of eminent character, both for moral and intellectual culture. They were thoroughly Southern in their education and sympathies.' We have our own notions about schools. We want to select our own teachers and our own books. We had some trouble before the war with our Yankee teachers. We could not avoid it. We were compelled to employ them, for Southern teachers were never so abundant as they should have been. But since the war, we are determined to keep our schools under our own control, and employ none but those on whose character for Southern sympathies we can depend. There was a Yankee in the Legislature from Wales county, who, although he had been in Tennessee for thirty years, and ought therefore to have been well acquainted with the habits of our people, was working hard to get a public school law through that body. But it was composed of native Tennesseeans with but few exceptions, and although all were Radicals, yet they were born and educated on Tennessee soil, and Tennesseeans have no love for public schools, such as the Northern States are cursed with. So the old fool, as he might have known, ingloriously failed. No, we did not want public schools—except for the poor—and for this reason we built our colleges. And now that we had the right kind of teachers, we opened and patronized the college. On the morning of its opening, I called on Professor North at his office. There I found Hapsburg with his daughter Emma. He regretted very much, he said, that Smithville was so badly supplied with schools. He was poor, he said, and was fearful he could not afford to patronize so costly an institution, but as there were no public schools he would give the matter a fair trial. He would educate his daughter, if he had to wheel dirt on a railroad at night to pay her tuition.
               'Will she take music?' asked Professor North.
               'No,' he replied, 'not now. I cannot afford it. I am only anxious at this time, that she acquire a thorough knowledge of the rudiments. She is young yet, and if we are able, she can acquire the outward accomplishments when she is older.'
               'What class do you wish her to start in?' asked North.
               'In the lowest,' said he.' I do not wish her to jump up the ladder. Let her grasp each round as she reaches it, and know that it is secure—to hold her while she reaches for the next.'
               'But she has been at school before, has she not?'
               'Yes that will only the better fit her for her present studies. Let her begin below.'
               'I am truly glad,' said North, 'to find that you so well understand what is necessary for a thorough education. You are the only patron I have who is not boring me about putting his daughter higher up than she is fit to go. But who is this young lady? said he, looking to a modest girl standing in the door with an arm full of books.
               'I am Mattie Holmes,' said she.
               'Oh, ah, yes,' said North, apparently wondering what to do.
               He took the girls away to the school room and Hapsburg left.
               That man Hapsburg,' said North, as he returned for some books,' has a better idea of a thorough education than any man I have met with for a long time.'
               I spent an hour in examining the building, and returned. On my way back to McCarty's I met Brown and a lady with a child apparently two or three years old in a buggy. Brown drove up to the side walk, and calling my attention, 'This,' said he is my wife just arrived from Pennsylvania.
               'Why,' said I; I thought you were unmarried,' to which he replied smiling, 'I rarely ever speak of family matters away from home,' and passed on.
               'Well!' thought I, what next? Married? eh? what'll Sue say now? and I went on to McCarty's.
               I found my friend Mr. Jenkins there. He was soliciting subscriptions and donations for the Orphan Asylum at Calhoun.
               'Did you ask the Yankees for any thing,' I asked.
               'Yes, and they forked over, too,' said he. Brown gave me fifty dollars, McClintock fifty, Hapsburg ten, Holmes ten, Pettibone ten, Coole ten and Cartwright five.
               'What's he doing,' I asked.
               'He is agent for various kinds of agricultural implements—reapers, mowers, plows, threshers, etc., This Orphan Asylum is a great thing, I was told. Some gentleman thought it would add to our power ever the public mind to get up something of the kind for the orphans of the confederate soldiers. They sent agents out through the countrys, who soon collected a large sum of money. The Northern people especially, donated largely. It was not known in the North, so Jenkins informed me, that it was being instituted for Confederate orphans alone, until after enough money was collected to purchase the necessary lands and buildings. A very large family mansion situated on a farm of three hundred acres of poor land, was purchased for forty thousand dollars, a board of directors—with President, Treasurer, Recording and corresponding secretary—all ladies—were elected, and the thing put under way, under the management of a board of gentlemen trustees.
               Some men of limited means, and very small brains, suggested that a much less expensive building, and much better land could have been obtained, for a greatly reduced price; and it would have looked better too, they thought. 'It was for orphans,' said they, 'who cannot afford to carry on such a life afterwards as will be taught them there. Their fathers did not live in such houses,' and all such silly stuff as this.
               How disgusting it is to hear some people talk. Now, in the South we are fond of show. Even though poor, we appear rich, and never let the world know any thing about what is behind the scenes. It ain't any of the world's business. We never intended to make dolls and playthings of these orphans or to feed them any better than they ought to be fed, but then, so fine a mansion, and such a sum of money paid for it, would sound well. It would be a big thing, and we could get money easier for it than if we began on a smaller scale. And then, our noble ladies, and our distinguished gentlemen could figure more largely in to grand an enterprise.
               I asked Jenkins whether the Yankees asked any questions about it before giving their money.
               'Oh yes,' said he: 'They all wanted to know whether it was for orphans generally, or only for a particular class.
               'What did you answer them?' I asked.
               'I told them of course it was for all orphans. We are going to have a Tournament in a few days for the benefit of the Asylum,' added he, 'when we expect to realize a large sum,' and he retired.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               
                  THE TOURNAMENT—A YANKEE FUNERAL.
               
               Of course we went to the Tournament. I took my family in a great, large carriage which had been fitted up expressly for this occasion. Mr. Burton was good enough to take Fanny off my hands. He was very kind and attentive to her all the day. Those Kentuckians are a gallant people.
               The Tournament was a grand affair. It was held in the 
                     Midddlebury
                     Middlebury
                   county Fair Grounds. A very large amphitheatre with raised seats encircling an area of about three hundred feet in diameter, in the center of which stood a stand for bands, speakers, judges etc., constituted, the arrangement for the comfort of those who should honor the proceedings with their presence. A great many people attended—at least ten thousand, and the exercices were grand. Who but young men of the South could perform such wonderful feats?
               Some of my Northern readers—and I 
                     expeet
                     expect
                   to have some of that kind—may not understand what a Tournament is. Therefore I will describe this one for their special benefit.
               The performers were a number of young gentlemen called Knights, each choosing his own character and title, as well as dress. We had on that occasion several Knights of English fame—and French—and Spanish—not forgetting the renowned Don Quixote. Then there was the American Indian, the Confederate soldier etc., and one other, dressed in plain black with a red scarf thrown on the right shoulder, crossing down in front to the left side, then passing round the waist and tied on the left with the ends hanging from the hip. I did not know him until after events called my attention to him.
               Posts, twelve in number, were placed at regular distances around the outside of the circular area before named. From these posts at the height of about nine feet, projected inside small strips of wood, say three feet in length, on the end of which was fastened a small piece of stout wire or strap iron bent. On each wire there was placed an iron ring—say three or four inches in 
                     diamater
                     diameter
                  . This arranged, a knight upon his horse starts at full speed around the ring, holding in his right hand a spear eight or ten feet long, with a round point with which he picks off the rings from the wires.
               It is very exciting to the spectators. One noble knight dashes headlong over the saw-dust flooring, and once around the circle in front of thousands of admiring eyes he goes—then on the second round you hear the rings rattle as they slide down the shaft of his spear. He rides proudly to the center, hands his trophies to the judges and takes his place again amidst his fellow knights who are near the stand in file, awaiting orders as they are given. The rings are replaced on the wires; another knight puts spurs to his panting steed, and away in the giddy circle he rides,—and so on to the end.
               The man with the red scarf came last. He rode a beautiful black charger. As the noble fellow leaped nimbly over 
                     the the
                     the
                   soft track and his rider sat as gracefully as a war veteran, I heard the cry from a hundred voices, "put that Yankee out." Then all eyes were turned full upon him. He was cool. His eyes, as they bent their piercing glance upon each ring as he swiftly approached it, sparkled like the sheen of the morning. He handed twelve rings to the judges. This had been done by one other knight only. He and the Yankee were "tied." They must renew the contest to settle who was best; for the most successful knight was to be charged with the honorable ceremony of crowning "the Queen of Love and Beauty" with a wreath of flowers—a pleasant duty to be performed on the head of the young lady whom the gallant knight should choose.
               Away darts the Confederate soldier. Around once—then began the rings to drop one after another on the shaft of his steady spear until he comes to the last. He trots proudly up and the judge pulls off twelve rings amid the cheers of ten thousand voices. The rings replaced, the Yankee starts, cautiously increasing his speed as he nears 
                     the the
                     the
                   end of the first round, when under a speed unequalled yet, he pierces the rings one, two, three—while the boys shout "out with the 
                     Yaukee
                     Yankee
                  , out with the Yankee!" The excitement grows intense, he catches every ring with the grace of a practised equestrian, until he comes to the tenth. He takes that—the eleventh—we hear the well known sound of the sliding ring; some one throws his hat in front of the noble horse; he shies, and the spear merely tips the outside of the ring. It dangles but still hangs. "Only eleven."—The crowd was relieved—they breathed easier, and a unanimous about of "Bravo Dixie" shook the air.
               Then came the ceremony of crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty. A speech was made to the successful knight by General Barnard, who was present with a number of other Confederate Generals, and a beautiful wreath with which to crown the fair damsel who might be worthy of so noble a knight, was given. The proud man of the saddle received the gift on the point of his spear which he carried to where the lady sat who was to be the fair recipient, and to my great surprise and pleasure he came toward where we were sitting and after making a speech which I do not now remember, dismounted and placed the wreath on the fair head of Miss Sue Bascom.
               Another very interesting part of the performance was the saber exercise, which consisted in taking off the heads of imaginary men placed at equal distance around the track, while the rider was at full speed. But the man with the red scarf did not enter the lists in this. He said he had been unfairly dealt with.
               Many other very agreeable and exciting exercises—such as races, contests for graceful riding, etc., were enjoyed, but I have given enough to give the curious reader an outline of what is a common and interesting amusement in Tennessee.
               I saw the Yankees and their families all present, but no one recognized or spoke to any of their women. I afterwards learned at McCarty's that they all thought Mr. Cartwright had been 'shamefully mistreated.'
               About two weeks after this, I learned that Brown's child was dead. I thought of the burial, and what, under ordinary circumstances would be my duty. I mentioned the matter to my friend McCarty. I always felt safe in consulting him in a trying emergency. What has made us such great friends, perhaps, is the fact that we both hold high positions in the order of Masons. I felt like consulting him in this case, because Brown also was a mason. I have already observed that we black-balled Hapsburg when his name was presented to our lodge, and that is some evidence of what we thought of Yankee masons.
               I put the case to Tom. 'Let the dead bury their dead' said that kind hearted and very good christian man. Tom belonged to our church—was a deacon. I took his advice. I did not visit the house of the dead at all then, before or since. The next day a small procession, consisting of the family of Brown, the Carpet-baggers generally, Moffatt, and Jenkins, with about five niggers, passed in front of my house, on their way to the burial ground. Mrs. Bascom, who with my whole family, except Sue, were watching the procession as it passed, remarked: 'If I had control of that graveyard, no Yankee young one should ever be buried in it. If I were buried there and they would put a dead Yankee in it, I would burst my coffin, and haunt the whole town forever.
               After it had passed, I desired to see Hapsburg. I wanted to borrow the last number of the New York Tribune, which I had learned contained an article on enfranchising the people of the South. I was anxious to see it. I would not subscribe for that incendiary paper under any circumstances, and would not permit it to come into my house. But I had an anxiety to know what it said occasionally, and so I went to Hapsburg who took it regularly. Roorback was in the office. (This was a day or two before he left the state.) He informed me that Hapsburg was 'at work on his house.'
               'On what house?' I asked.
               He purchased a lot of ground just outside the city limits, and is hard at work building his house.'
               'Has he no mechanics?' I asked.
               None but himself.' said he.
               He starts from his home every morning before daybreak, with his saw, square and hatchet, and does not come home until after dark. He expects to complete it far enough in a month to make it comfortable for his family.'
               'You Yankees are a wonderful people,' said I. 'Is Hapsburg a carpenter?' I asked.
               'No, but he can use tools. We are all taught to do a little of every kind of rough work in the North,' said he. 'Hapsburg is poor, therefore he does his work himself. We are taught to look upon labor as honorable, and then our knowledge of manual labor often serves us a good purpose, in supplying the place of work purchased on credit.'
               I got the paper and started for Poole's, thinking as I left, these Yankees are up to anything.
               On arriving at my office, I found Long there. 'Bascom,' said he, 'there is something good in that fellow Hapsburg. This morning he called me into his office in a manner that made me think he had some great secret to tell me. When seated, he read a letter to me addressed to the President, requesting the pardon of yourself, Randolph and Stout. He requested me not to name the matter to any one, but wished my advice about the propriety of mailing the letter.'
               'What advice did you give?' I asked.
               'To mail it at once, and he did so.'
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               
                  NIGGER VOTERS—CARPET BAGGERS IN A NEW ROLE—DECLARATION OF WAR—PRIVATE MEETING IN HAPPY ROW—LOYAL MILITIA—STATE CONVENTION PROPOSED—TWO FACES—LOYAL LEAGUE—BOB ON POLITICS
               
               As we enter the year 1867, the Carpet-baggers begin to appear on the stage more prominently. We begin to see their animus as the lawyers say. Their malignity rises above their reticence, and their devilish spirit shows itself. From the period of which I now write, we shall be able to trace the slime of their tracks much more readily. They begin to appear in their true light. In August a Governor was to be elected, and we were discovering signs of unusual activity on their part.
               As I have before remarked, in the spring elections of '66, we turned every radical out of office, and elected our own kind of men; that is, in all offices which were to be filled at that time; such as Sheriffs, County Judges, Constables etc. This action on our part alarmed the loyal Legislature, and that body of fanatics and fools passed another and more stringent law on suffrage, by which at least one thousand men were disfranchised in our county alone. But in the fall elections of '66, when we elected Members of Congress, and some new members of the state Legislature, we were still strong enough in Middle and West Tennessee to carry the elections. In order to remedy this—(for the radicals were determined to keep the power in their own hands—) they passed the third franchise law, by which every buck nigger in Tennessee was made a voter. This startled us. No act could have more thoroughly aroused our indignation. We threatened revolution, we threatened war; and then to make the matter still worse, because we made these threats, Brownlow organized his loyal militia, and notified us that he was ready for us. Was any people ever so insulted before? Was ever man so humiliated? We, the high toned gentlemen of the state of Tennessee, must have our hands tied while the brutal niggers are placed over us as guards.
               We held a private meeting in Happy Row. Randolph was there; so was Long, and Stout, Highflyer, Peebles, Moffat, and the young men, Squibbs, Dobbs and a few more. Jenkins was present also, and Captain Bombast, and Col. Lambert.
               There was no use in any statement of the object of the meeting. All understood that. The niggers had been enfranchised. The certificates of registration by the County Court Clerks were annulled, and new Registrars appointed, while Brownlow was authorized to set aside the registration of any county that did not suit him. Southern men can appreciate our condition, therefore I need not elaborate.
               But what was to be done? that was what concerned us most. We could never indure such indignity. The universal feeling of all the company at first blush, except Moffat and the young lawyers, was to fight, to fight it out at once. Long was very much excited, and was so nearly ready for the war as to have all his arms in readiness then and there. Nothing would satisfy him but blood. But Stout suggested that 'if we let them alone awhile they will soon quarrel among themselves, and then by prudent management, we can operate as a balance power, and get possession of the State.'
               Long said 'No, we can't wait and let these infernal niggers run over us. I'm for war to the death.'
               'Can't we call a State convention of the disfranchised?' said Randolph, 'and organize another State government, and oust this accursed despotism?'
               'Good idea!' said Col. Lambert, who had been drinking some—his usual habit.
               'You are all fools,' said Moffat. 'You were whipped so badly once that you were glad to get home and be allowed to live, and now you want to be whipped again, I suppose, and bring destruction on the country anew. Better all of us go to our legitimate business, and obey the laws as we have promised to do. Almost every man here is a soldier on parole. Your pledges were made while yet you were in the hands of the government that conquered you. If you are determined to make asses of yourselves, and victims of the people, go on, but don't look for support from me. I'm for peace and obeying the law.'
               'Moffat,' said Long with that fire which always burns in him, 'you are a traitor. You are a disgrace to the South and to your family and name. You are a low, mean dirty dog. If you persist in this treachery, you shall be expelled from all good society ety, and your name made a by word and reproach to your children. If you can't go with us, leave the country for the country's good. We'll have nothing more to do with you. You are a leper; a festering sore on our body, and the sooner we spew you out the better! Go!'
               But Moffat did not go just then.
               'You are all cowards,' said he, 'and you know it. For many long years you have governed this land with a rod of iron. You have built up a system of social aristocracy whose power has been a despotism, a tyranny and a curse. Because a man cannot indorse what you propose, you proscribe him, you abuse him and denounce him, until the people learn to believe your devilish cheat and help you drive him into outlawry. I too, am a Southern man, a native of Tennessee, but I am an American, and although you dragged me into one rebellion, you can never do it again. I say you are cowards. I know you,' and he left the office.
               'We'll soon tame him,' said Long. He's always been a half-way abolitionist, but he has too much social influence here to risk its loss. He'll come right in time.'
               'What about my idea—the State convention?' said Randolph.
               'That will depend entirely,' said Stout, 'on how much strength we can command from the moderate Republicans.'
               'D—n the moderate Republicans,' quickly interposed Long. 'We're strong enough alone, and they'll betray us. Talk about a genuine Republican helping to destroy Brownlow and his machine. Why Stout, you're a fool.'
               'Then,' said Stout, there is no use in debating the subject of a convention. We tried that game once alone, and if my memory serves me well, we slightly failed.'
               'Suppose we consult Hapsburg,' I suggested.
               That idea seemed to be favorably received.
               'If we can use him for any good purpose and then drop him when we wish to,' said Long, 'I am willing; but is he not growing too popular among the common people already?'
               'We can manage that,' said Doubleface.
               'That fellow will deceive you all yet,' said Stout. He is a Yankee, and more than that he is intensely Union. Besides he is a confounded good lawyer. You must remember he never discusses the politics of the war with us. Watch him.'
               It was decided however that Randolph should sound him, and he left for that purpose. We discussed Robertson, and other matters until he returned. He came, and taking his seat beside the table, facing us, said:
               'What do you suppose that fellow said? I broached the subject very cautiously, and came up to it step by step. He listened to me very attentively. At length, after I had beat the bushes all around, I came boldly out and said: Now Hapsburg, in the event of our doing this thing, what would be your action?'
               'I would pull on my old blue coat again,' said he, 'and advise all my old comrades to do the same thing.—Abandon that idea at once. You are well nigh ruined now; that step would complete your destruction. Every Union man, and especially every Union soldier, is sworn to support and defend the State government of Tennessee.'
               'I knew it,' said Long.
               'Then,' said Doubleface, 'our game is blocked there. We must drop the idea of a convention. But we must do what will be painful to us all. I am ready for it, and you will all soon be. It is our only hope. We must go into the canvass, and work for the nigger vote.'
               'Never! never!' said Long. 'A Southern born man to ask a nigger for his vote? You had better go with Moffat.'
               'Hold!' said the General. Hapsburg gives the true idea. If we undertake to revolutionize the State government, we will fail, and fail forever. But if we go into the canvass, we let the world believe we are not hurt by negro suffrage, and if we fail to get their votes this time, we will win the next.'
               'I will have nothing to do with it while the nigger votes,' said Long.
               'You will be glad to change your mind before many months,' continued Doubleface. 'You will yet have to indorse nigger suffrage in public.'
               'Never!' said Long.
               'I tell you,' said the General, 'I have carefully studied the situation, and I am convinced there is only one avenue of escape. We must wear two faces. We must do a great deal of dirty work, and eat a great many of our own words before we get to the end of this thing. We all agree that power is what we want. We can only get that by making everybody believe we are their friends. We must do anything, say anything, and be anything for success.'
               'I can't wear two faces,' said Long.
               'You'll have it to do,' said Doubleface, 'or you can't succeed. Now the first thing for us to do is to secure Hapsburg. We must take him in as a counsellor; we must nominate him for the Senate, and treat him with so much attention that he will serve our purpose. We must put him forward and that will break the lines of the enemy.'
               'I have no objection to that,' said Long. 'But what about the nigger?'
               'Hapsburg will do most of our talk. We can pass resolutions, and make an occasional speech. We can get up barbecues, and let him do the dirty work.'
               And that was our plan. We notified fied Hapsburg of our intention to nominate him for the Senate. He refused; he was a mere immigrant, he said, and preferred to wait. We insisted. He agreed to accept on one condition. We must indorse his opinions. We consented. He drew up a platform, favoring universal suffrage—free schools, free discussion, etc. We despised him and his platform, but we indorsed all. We called a public meeting, adopted his platform and nominated him for the Senate. So much, so good.
               'But,' said he, 'you must say to the people, in public speeches, and through your newspaper, that you are not only in favor of free ballot and free schools, but that you mean what you say, and will not abandon your faith.'
               'Agreed,' said we, and Gen. Doubleface had a meeting of the colored people called for that purpose.
               We were beginning to call them 'colored people.' We had to drop 'nigger' in public. The same kind of feeling was growing all over the State. We held a State Convention. Hapsburg and I were appointed as delegates. In caucus we made a strong effort to discard the nigger question altogether, but Hapsburg and his party defeated us.
               'We must,' said he, 'shoulder the whole burden. We must make universal suffrage and free schools the principal plank in our creed.'
               And we did, except the schools. We couldn't get up any enthusiasm on schools, and we dropped that. The Conservative party of Tennessee took high grounds on all leading questions. It was the most liberal platform in America. It was for universal civil and political equality. But then we indorsed Andy Johnson and nominated Etheridge. The Union element beat us in the platform, but we headed them off in the nomination.
               This, however, is only one side of the picture. Let us look at the other. My boy Bob had always been a good nigger. He was now about fifty years old, and he had never betrayed me. But I had discovered of late, that Bob was frequently absent at night to a late hour, and I could not learn what he was doing or where he went. So I called him into my parlor one morning, and made him give an account of himself.
               'Bob,' I began, 'where were you last night?'
               'Out to de school house,' answered Bob.'
               'What were you doing there?'
               'I war listenin to de speak in.'
               'Who spoke?'
               Mistoo Holmes, Cap'n Clintuck an Judge Brown; dey all speakin.'
               'Were any other white men there?'
               'Yes, Marse Dick, Major Bunting, Mistoo Pettibone and Mistoo Coole, all dar, and Jimmy Holmes.'
               'Was Capt. Hapsburg there?'
               'No sah, he don gone ober to do rebels.'
               'Why, Bob,' said I, in utter astonishment, 'what the devil do you know about rebels? Don't you know there are no rebels now? Don't you know we are all for free schools and universal suffrage?'
               'I knows you all says so, marster, but I'se too old for dat. Dem big words don't ceive dis chile.'
               'You infernal old wooly headed fool you,' said I. 'Have these Yankee theives been telling you these things?'
               'I'se got em in here,' said he, patting his breast with his hand. I, feels em in my berry bones.'
               'Bob, do you think these Yankees are your friends?'
               'Dey's done one good job for me—dey set me free.'
               'Don't you know they are a set of thieving scoundrels and liars, that would sell you into slavery again if they could make any thing by it?'
               'You all showed em how to do dat ting, but Glory to God, dey went tother way.'
               'Why you interminable old wretch, are you going crazy?'
               'Not crazy Marse Dick, but berry happy. Oh! I is so free,' and the old nigger clapped his hands and laughed, weaving back and forth on his stool like a weaver's frame.
               'Now Bob' said I, 'You are a stupid old nigger. These narroweyed villians only want your money, and don't care what becomes of you.
               'Dey can't be wosser an some odder people round dese coalins.'
               'I'll knock you down,' said I reaching for my cane, if you don't be more evil. Now tell me what you do at those meetings.'
               'We has de league dare.'
               'The league?' said I, in astonishment. 'What the devil is the league?
               'We takes an oaf to vote for loil men for de offices.'
               'Ah,! that's what your doing, is it? You want to turn against your old friends and take up with these fellows from the North. What did they ever do for you?
               'Gin us freedom marse Dick' interposed the nigger.
               'Now Bob, these miserable sneaks and cut-throats, hav'nt got any property here; they can't give you any employment; and if they could there's only half a dozen here. What can they do for you?'
               'Dey's got jes lots o' frens what dey come from.'
               'Aye, that's the trouble,' thought I: If they had no friends to back them, we would not have been cursed this long with their insulting presence. I talked with Bob a long time and tried to show him that the Carpet-baggers would ruin him; that his only hope was in his old master—his real true friend. But Bob was invincible. He was infatuated with the league and his new leaders. No argument could convince him. He had an idea that his liberty was worth all else, and I was about to abandon my effort. I was afraid to threaten him lest he should blow on me. We had to play our game well. The nigger is not a fool if he is black. I thought I would try again.
               "Bob," said I, as a last chance: "Suppose I should discharge you for this foolishness, what would you think of your Yankee friends then? Could you get employment from them?"
               'But you can't do dat, marse Dick,' kase you all say, 'Ekal rights for all men don't stinction ob race or color. You're for free discushen, free schools, and free votin. Does you mean all dat?"
               
               'Certainly Bob,' said I.
               'Den I'se free as you; and I'm for dem too. I'se for free schools and free votin, and I'se guine to vote for Brownlow.'
               What could I do? It was'nt safe to knock him down. Indeed the nigger was master. I grasped my cane, and Bob looked at the fire-tongs.
               Get out of this, you stinkin old villian said I, "before I shoot you,' and Bob walked rather rapidly out somewhat bent, and as he left the door, he began to draw out of his pocket that inevitable spelling book—Damn that nigger.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               
                  GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN—DOUBLE FACE SPEAKS TO HIS COLORED FRIENDS—HAPSBURG MAKES AN ASS OF HIMSELF—IMMIGRATION SOCIETIES—REGISTRATION OFFICES OPENED.
               
               The political parties are organized; we register as voters; candidates are out, and the canvass opens. We begin to draw the lines. We proscribe radicals. We fondle and pet Hapsburg—although he always claimed to be a Republican, and proposed to his opponent that if he (Poodles) would come out for universal suffrage, or the Congressional Reconstruction plan, he (Hapsburg) would withdraw! But the Radicals were in earnest. They were for restricted suffrage, and we for universal civil and political equality. We had thrown down all barriers; we knew no race or color; we loved everybody but Brownlow Radicals; we were reformers, for we stood at the head of progressive politicians. There was only one step we had not taken. We had not declared for woman suffrage.
               Poodles, the Radical candidate for the Senate, was a native Tennessean, and had not forgotten our mode of canvassing. He pitched into Hapsburg with a genuine Southern fierceness. He called him a traitor—a Rebel—a place hunter—a hungry politician. He called the Conservatives all liars, cheats, and scoundrels. In this respect our man Hapsburg was not a match for him. We told him he must abuse his opponent, must abuse Brownlow; abuse everybody in general save his own party. But he said he did not know how to abuse any one: he was not so taught in his boyhood, and did not wish to learn so disgraceful a practice now. If he could not convince the reason, he did not wish to arouse the passions. And then he said, he differed with his opponent only on the question of suffrage;—there was not enough between them to get mad about.' And we were unable to arouse any resentment in him—he would not and did not abuse anybody, except the Democrats—he was severe on them. But he would not admit even, that the Radicals were scoundrels. He did not suit us at all, but we could hold him up as a shield to receive the darts of the enemy, as the Spanish Toriero holds up his red blanket for the wild bull he is fighting to waste his strength upon. We soon discovered that we must go to work ourselves. The niggers were wild for Brownlow. Long forgot his antipathy to niggers and two-facedness; Randolph dropped his dignity, and to work we went. We organized Conservative clubs. We took niggers into our private meetings, appointed them on our committees, drank whiskey with them, gave them front seats at our meetings and first tables at our barbecues. We held meetings and publicly denounced the Carpet-baggers as thieves, cut-throats, assassins, plunderers, and everything which the brilliancy of the Southern intellect could invent. Long made speeches, Randolph made speeches, as did myself, Doubleface and others, and the little Dutch Yankee and came to our aid manfully. But Stout refused. He said it was wasting time and sense.
               The meeting appointed for Doubleface and the 'colored people,' as we now called them, was at hand. We had a very large meeting; at least one thousand niggers being in attendance. We took back seats—we intended to show them that we were in earnest. They listened very attentively to the General, and kept perfect order. Said the General:
               'My colored friends, I am very happy to see so many of you present to-day. You are now voters, and I have come to advise you how to vote. You know I am your friend; and that all these honorable gentlemen behind you are your friends. We could not be anything else than your friends. You have been good faithful servants to us. Besides this we were born together and we have passed our childhood together; we grew up together. When I was a child I had a white mother in the parlor, and a black mamma in the kitchen. I nursed at both their breasts. Then we are friends. We would be very ungrateful indeed, if we did not remember your services, and the common pleasures of our childhood. We are glad to see you free, and we are determined to see that you are protected in your freedom. We will see to it that these Carpetbag cheats and swindlers don't rob you of your liberty. No one loves so much to see you enjoy your liberty as your old masters.—(applause from the whites)—Now we don't intend to let these 
                     theives
                     thieves
                   and cutthroats of Yankees destroy your freedom. These miserable wretches come here to steal your freedom away from you; they want to cheat and deceive you until they can sell you into slavery again. But we will stand by you, and if they attempt to carry out their infamous schemes, we'll let them know who your friends are. We have the lands, the houses, the mules and horses. You have those hands, good honest hands, and want to use them. Then let us remain friends forever. And then we are for your education too. (cheers from the niggers.) Yes we intend to build you school houses and churches, and employ teachers to teach you and your children to read. You must be educated'—(cheers louder than before from the niggers.)
               The General saw he had struck the right vein.
               Yes, you must be educated, so that you can pass through the world as gentlemen should do. The people of Tennessee are friends of the education of the poor. Look at our school houses throughout the State. See what we have done for the poor white people. Now we will do the same for you because we think it right, and then we feel that we owe it to you. (cheers) I advise you to vote for no man who is not in favor of your education. When a candidate solicits your vote, ask him how much he will give or do toward building school-houses for your children. Now these Yankees don't want you educated, because they know when you get to be as smart as they are (and many of you are that now) they can't cheat and rob you as they are doing now, and that is all they want to do. Watch them, they are after your liberties. If they wanted to educate you, why are they not making some move toward it? [Why don't you move dat way? asked a voice.] 'I will answer you, my colored friend, continued the General. 'We are not in power now. Wait till we get things in our own hands again and we will make the move. These Yankees don't know nor care anything about you. They don't know your wants like we do. They never watched by your bedside in sickness as we did—' [An dey neber beat us at de pose too, like you did, an hang us, an stick our heads on fence poles,'] said a voice. ['An dey sleep wid us on de field,'] said another. ['Hurrah for the Yankees' said a third.]
               The General wiped his face; he was perspiring freely. It was evident that abuse of the Yankees, was not as good a key to their affections, as building school-houses, and he took up that subject again.
               But I need not repeat what he said further, as it was a mere continuation of his former assertions. He concluded by asking 'all the white gentlemen present,' if they did not indorse everything he had said. We said we did, and hallooed for 'equal rights,' and swung our hats.
               The meeting adjourned, but I can't say that I thought there was much good done. Some few colored men however, followed the General to his office where they had an interview with him privately. What passed I never knew, but they all voted for Brownlow.
               Etheridge came to Smithville to speak. We all turned out en mass. The ladies in large numbers honored him with their presence. A great many niggers were there also. Etheridge was for proscription. 'Proscribe them,' said he, 'on the street, in the counting-room, in the business house, in the schools, in the churches and in the social circle; proscribe them everywhere.'
               That suited as all, especially the ladies, and we cheered him vociferously. 'Yes,' said he, 'we are for the political and civil equality of all men, but Radicals'
               And thus the canvass went on. We said every thing we knew and a great deal that we did'nt, and did every thing we could to win the nigger vote, but all to no purpose, as it seemed. They had their night meetings and their day meetings, their celebrations and processions, their picnics and their barbacues, all managed by the Carpet-baggers. The fire was spreading. The country was aroused. They celebrated the 4th of July—something that we have sadly neglected since 1860. Thousands of them came out. The Carpet-baggers managed the ropes. Hapsburg also was there and made a speech. Oh! these infamous 
                     wetches
                     wretches
                  , how they were grinding us beneath them. But we were into it and must go ahead. We crowded the registration office. Hapsburg got us five hundred certificates. We tried to get the niggers to join our clubs, but failed. They did not attend our meetings. They grew more shy of us every day. At length we got mad, and resolved that if we could not rule them we would ruin them. We tried to get up a riot, so that we could have an opportunity to kill off the white scoundrels who led them, and then we could whip them into obedience. But they were instructed not to drink our whisky, and not to resent any insult. Billy Ward knocked one of them down a grocer's cellar with a patent hame, but he staid there till Billy went away. We were desperate, and sent for United States troops to protect us from riots and mobs, and Brownlow sent his nigger militia. Then we swore, and rent our clothes, but we soon got over that. General Doubleface called on the commanding officer, and had him promise not to interfere as a partisan. That individual said he was a military officer, not a politician, and had come to preserve the peace.
               We went to work again. We got up subscriptions for colored churches, gave the niggers fine suppers, gave them presents—flattered and promised them, but here again we failed, and we were indeed undone. The half a dozen Carpet-baggers could manage a thousand niggers, while the rest of the county could not control but three, and two of these were barbers and the other the nigger that cleans up the offices in Happy Row.
               I asked Bob what it all meant. He said: 'You all's guine wrong Marse Dick. Goin right back into 'belion gin, sartin. Dis niggah's no fool—mind dat. Dese Yankees will beat you so bad you'll be nowhars.'
               We talked of forming trade societies—to bind ourselves not to trade or do any kind of business with the Carpet-baggers, but there was no use in that, for none but niggers gave them any business, and we had no trade to control. We tried to scorn, scowl and shame them away from their politics, but here as elsewhere we failed, and we dared not fight, for our own troops—that infernal militia—[we had requested them] were here. We had to submit. Then we threatened to discharge the niggers. This too failed.
               Election came. The niggers came to town by thousands. They came by daybreak in the morning, and came all day. They voted in squads, as horses would. They stood in a dense mass, and poured their numbers into the voting room like ants. Their order was perfect. They had been drilled to their business. We could not induce one to taste whisky. They voted and went home.
               I humbly pray that such a scene may never be repeated in our land. The intelligence and wealth of the country compelled to look on while the ignorance and poverty dictate who our rulers should be and what our laws. Think of it reader. Such men as Mr. Randolph, Col. Stout and myself to be disfranchised while our niggers do the voting. Alas! it has come to this. What next?
               We were defeated. Brownlow was elected by 53,000. Next morning after breakfast we began to discharge our Brownlow niggers. But we were compelled to hire them over again at advanced wages in less than two weeks, for we could not get along without laborers, and there were no Conservative niggers in the city, but the three I have mentioned, and they were employed. What then was to be done?
               Oh! yes, now we have the true theory. We will form immigration societies and get enough Germans and Irish in to offset the niggers. This idea took. The whole county came out to a great immigration meeting some two weeks after the election. We formed a society. So they did all over Middle and West Tennessee. We elected a president, a secretary and treasurer. The Carpet-baggers were not present at these meetings. We appointed our committees. The farmers donated liberally. We appointed an agent to go to Germany for immigrants. We employed Heiberger, the Dutch Yankee to accompany our agent as an interpreter. We instructed our agent to go by way of New Orleans, and to return by the same route. He must in no event return by New York or any of the Northern ports whence Carl Schurz or other Northern fanatics could reach the immigrants and tamper with them. They must not touch Northern soil under any circumstances, nor breathe Yankee air. From that time on we intended to control our own affairs, and we would populate Tennessee with Dutch who did not know enough to vote against us. We wanted fresh laborers whom we could manage. We wanted anybody, everybody, but blue-bellied Yankees. Them we did not want, and we said so.
               I say we formed an immigration society, appointed agents and raised some money to get Dutch in the county. We believed we could control them. We had enough of Yankees, and wanted no more—then or now. We thought we were on the right track once. I called on Hapsburg and submitted our plan to his judgment.
               'You are mad,' said he. 'Do you suppose such a scheme as that will work?'
               'We were expecting your assistance,' said I, [although we were done with him then.]
               'Sir,' said he, 'the Germans are not fools. What inducements do you offer them? Nothing but to work. You have no schools for them, and you don't propose to make them your equals, but slaves, and then you invite Germans only. Why not throw open your hearts and your country and invite the world in? You don't invite the Northern man—the very man you need most. You refuse and scorn him. Sir, you will fail and ought to fail.'
               And so we did. Our agent never left home. Indeed we could not raise more than about five hundred dollars to carry the thing through, and it dropped—an abortion.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               
                  MONEY MARKET TIGHT—GENEROSITY OF CARPET-BAGGERS—BANKRUPTCY—NEW PAPER—HOW IT WAS PATRONIZED—MORE CARPET-BAGGERS—GRIT OF A FEMALE YANKEE—YOUNG YANKS AT COLLEGE—HOW OUR GIRLS TREAT THEM—BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.
               
               I was badly in need of money. My wife had contracted some debts at various places in the city, and they were due. I had already spent two hours on the streets and in the offices of business men in a fruitless effort to effect a loan, when I chanced to meet my friend Peebles. I asked him for money. He said he had been out on the same errand all morning, and had just borrowed $500 from a man whom he tried without any hope whatever of getting it.
               'Where did you get it?' I asked.
               'From Brown, the Carpet-bagger,' said he.
               'Ah! ideed!. Has he any more?' I asked.
               'I don't know; that was all I asked for, and he gave it to me without a word, nor required security.'
               I made for Brown's office; he was not in. I made my business known to McClintock. He handed me a check for $1000; said he would not need it under thirty days, and I might as well have the use of it as not. I thanked him and had risen to retire, when Major Spooner, merchant next door to Capt. Bombast, came hurriedly in, and addressing McClintock, without noticing my presence at all, said:
               'Captain I am cramped. I want two thousand dollars for ten days.'
               Without exchanging a word, the check was written out, and Spooner left.'
               McClintock engaged me in conversation a few minutes, and while I was there, no less than six of our principal business men and lawyers came into that office to borrow money—from $100 to $2000, and every man got the sum he asked for.
               Most of our respectable business men had been compelled to settle with their creditors in the Bankrupt Court and this accounts for the temporary pressure in the money market. It was only temporary, for they had all made sample provision for themselves and families before going into court. That I believe, is usual in bankruptcy.
               'Major Bascom,' said McClintock, 'we are about to start another newspaper in Smithville. Do you think it will pay?'
               'Smithville ought to be able to support two papers,' said I, and I arose again to leave, for I did not intend to give him any ancouragement about his paper, and after his material generosity. I did not feel like telling him what my thoughts were. I had had quite enough of Radicalism already. But he was not done with me.
               'Would the business men of the city patronize it?' he asked.
               'Well, indeed, ah—I hardly know how to answer that. Will the politics be Democratic?'
               'No,' said he, 'Republican.'
               'Well,' said I, putting on my hat, and going this time in good earnest, you can see them about it.'
               I left the office in a kind of mental bewilderment. I was carrying $1000 of that Yankee's money in my pocket, and others of our best citizens that I knew of, wore doing the very same thing. They don't hate us thought I. who could do more and with as good grace, than those men we are abusing every day? and then,—but I was at the bank. The cashier laughed at me.
               'You too,' said he, as though it was any of his business. 'These Yankees are accommodating more of our citizens at this counter, than any of the banks.'
               Gen. Highflyer and our minister came in just after I had had my check cashed. Highflyer is an elder in our church. They informed me that two strange families had quite recently arrived in the city, and said we had better call on them first to secure their patronage and attendance in our church. We visited Mr. Maxwell's first. We found them a very respectable family from Missouri, and church members. We spent a few minutes very pleasantly there, and left with one more family on the roll of our membership. We next called on Mrs. Barton. Her husband was absent.—They were not professing christians. We left as good an impression as we could on the lady, and insisted strongly on her joining our church. We then made a call at one or two other places, closing with Mrs. McFlimsey.
               At each of these last places, we were informed that the Bartons were Yankees, fresh from Michigan. We went directly back and inquired of the lady if what we had heard was true.
               'Yes,' she said, turning from her piano, 'I am from Michigan. Does that make any difference with you?' and she seemed greatly surprised at our anxiety in regard to her former home?
               'Our people have not yet forgotten the prejudices of the war,' said the minister.
               
               They don't want another one, do they?' asked she a little piqued.
               'The war has been transferred to the social circle,' said I. 'We are conquerors there.'
               'Then,' said she, 'rising to her feet and locking me full in the face, 'although I make no public profession of religion, my creed is better than yours. It knows no race, color or birthplace. The christian in my opinion, should follow the teachings of the master be professes to serve, and He bids all men come. How much more I think of you, than you do of me. We have come a thousand miles to live with you, and yet because we are from Michigan, you are not willing even to put us on probation, and give us a trial, but proscribe us at once, Oh! shame on such religion, a curse on such christianity.'
               'Pray don't be angry with us,' said Mr. Spellman, the minister.
               I am not angry with you, but I disgusted,' said she, and I saw a tear stealing from out her sparkling eyes.
               That atmosphere was not healthy for us, and we abandoned it as soon as possible.
               We stopped at McCarty's. Prof-North was there, and several other prominent citizens.
               'How do the Yankee girls get on school?' I asked addressing North.
               Emma Hapsburg,' said he, 'stands the head of all her classes, and is much the best behaved, as well as the best scholar in the college.'
               'How does she get on with the other girls?' I asked.
               'Oh!' he said, 'they treat her coldly but not rudely. She is so serviceable to most of them in assisting their dullness, that they dare not entirely discard her. I was very much amused the second day after the school opened, when overhearing a conversation among them on her case. Said one to her, 'You are a Yankee, aint you?'
               'I don't know,' she answered whether I am or not. I'm a girl. 'But ain't your father a Yankee?' 'Why what is a Yankee?' she asked, apparently not knowing what they were talking about, and looking more than half her time on her grammar lesson. Why ain't you all from the North? 'We are from Ohio,' she said looking on the ground while she repeated a part of her lesson. 'Then you're a Yankee' said the girls, and we hate Yankees. We're rebels, and we're better than the Yankees.'
               'Well,' said she we don't hate rebels. Father never talks about Yankee's and rebels. He says its wrong.'
               'That,' said McCarty 'reminds me of what Mrs. Pence told me yesterday about little Ed. Hapsburg at her school. She said one of the boys had pushed him over a bank, and told him he was a Yankee. She said the little fellow crawled up the bank, knocked the dust off his pants, seeming not to understand that he was insulted, and coolly remarked, as he ran after the ball, 'Well, the Yankees whipped the rebels.'
               'But what about the nigger parson's daughter?' I asked.
               'She has not been treated well, I am sorry to say,' answered North. I was greatly embarrassed in her case. I was sorry she came to school. Her continued presence would have created trouble in the college, but I did not know what to do. She was a well behaved and very smart girl. The other girls would not speak to her, except to halloo at her through windows, and from various places when she was passing. They called her nigger—nigger school teacher—wench, and made mouths at her as she passed. The poor girl stood it all in silence and made no complaint. Failing in this way to drive her home, at the end of about two weeks, they took her hat, a neat, fashionable, costly hat, and threw it down one of the sinks. That was too much for her pride. She cried bitterly, and putting her veil over her head, went sobbing home.'
               'Served her right,' said Hippenhammer, 'I wish it had been her father instead of her hat.'
               I changed the current of conversation to the new paper.
               'I have heard of that,' said McCarty, 'but we can't patronize any such thing. It must be choked off, as decently as possible, but effectually. We ca'nt submit to any more disgrace. Why, it would ruin the trade of any man in the city to advertise in it.'
               At that moment Col. Knox, president of the Smithville Bank, and agent for half a dozen fire and life insurance companies, came in.
               'Yes,' said he, 'these Yankees have been after me to give them my advertising.'
               'And are you going to give it to them?' asked half a dozen voices at once.
               'Not much,' said he. 'Do you suppose I would destroy my own business by patronizing a dirty Yankee sheet like that? If I were to put one advertisement into that paper I would be removed from my agencies in less than a week, and the directors of the bank would discharge me at once. No business or business man can live in Smithville who associates with them, or patronizes their business. I take a purely business view of it, and I tell you it wont do.'
               Just as Col. Knox was finishing his remark, we were all a little embarrassed at seeing the active Brown step in with a small blank book in his hand.
               'Good morning, gentlemen,' said he. 'I am glad to see so many of the professional and business men of the city in one place.'
               He stared somewhat as he was compelled to see every gentleman in the room, except McCarty, Knox and myself get up and walk out.
               
               'What about those advertisements, Col. Knox?' said he.
               'I dare not patronize your paper,' said Knox. 'It would utterly destroy my business.'
               'I patronize your bank; patronize Major McCarty's store, Capt. Bombast's store, and every business place in town so far as my little patronage extends; that don't destroy my business. Why should your patronizing our paper hurt yours?'
               'Our people have not got over their prejudices yet,' said Knox.
               'Will they ever do it?' asked Brown.
               'I can't say as to that,' answered Knox.
               'All I wish to know is, whether you intend to be liberal and fair. If the business men of Smithville are ashamed to advertise in my paper, they ought to be ashamed to ask me for accommodations. Judge Pinchbeck donated $200. Do you propose to be liberal?'
               'We may as well understand each other as business men,' said Knox. 'Business is business; I cannot patronize your paper, because I do business to make money, and that would destroy my business utterly and forever,' and he withdrew.
               Turning to McCarty, Brown said:
               'Will you patronize our paper?'
               'No; and for the reason just stated by Col. Knox,' said Tom.
               'Well,' said Brown,' I had no idea hat politics ever injured business before. I have been at every business house in the city this morning, and have not obtained a single subscriber, or an advertisement, except two colored shoemakers and one or two white men whose trade is almost exclusively confined to the colored people. But gentlemen, I am not starting this paper to make money, but to do good, and the Smithville Mail will make its first appearance next Saturday morning, and repeat the dose every Saturday thereafter for some years to come, if Samuel Brown keeps above water. We have the money,' and he turned on his heel to go, but the door was diagonally blockaded by the inevitable Prim and his pipe.
               'Say, Brown,' began Prim, 'if you want to get on easy here while you are allowed to stay, you had better let that paper business alone. These people wont stand a Radical paper here. You can't get five subscribers in the city, and nobody will advertise in it. It would ruin anybody's business to take a Yankee paper. It's goin to get d—d hot here before long—you better not have too much on hand.'
               'When it gets too hot for me, Mr. Prim,' said Brown, smiling, 'some other gentlemen not far from here will feel the heat.'
               'We wont tolerate nigger league men an hour longer than we must for appearance sake,' added Prim. Brown walked rapidly down street.
               'Prim,' said I, 'you are giving us a great deal of trouble with your interminable meddling in our affairs.'
               I love to keep the critters a bilin,' said he, as he pulled out a very long twist of homespun.
               'Yes, that is all well enough, but it keeps us back so much longer.'
               'I spose you see there aint no more comin, don't you? If I was to behave like you all in here, the town would be full of Yanks in six months. You all's deceivin of em. They'd think it was all right and bring their friends, if I didn't keep the brakes down. I keep em stirred up like the showman does his monkeys. I'm helpin the cause a mighty sight more than you all. My head's level. D—n em, I don't want em here any more than you all, and if you'd jes let me alone, they'd been done gone long ago,' and he lit his pipe which he had been filling while he delivered himself of this speech.
               I may as well add here, that we resolved not to patronize any paper published to insult us, our children and our pride, and we resolved further, to disown and disgrace any and every one of our people who had anything to do with it. No, we gave it no support whatever, and our own paper, the Reporter, did not even notice the existence of the dirty sheet for more than a year after its publication. The Legislature passed a legal advertising law requiring the legal advertising to be done in certain papers, and this vile thing, the Smithville Mail, received all that kind of business in about ten counties adjoining, for there was no other paper printed in those counties except the Reporter, and it was now proscribed. Had it not been for this piece of Radical ruffianism, the infamous concern could not have paid for the paper on which it was printed. That was a very unjust, damnable proceeding. The Reporter was an old and well established paper, which was taken by at least half the families in the county where any member thereof could read, and yet the legal advertising must be taken from it and handed over to this Radical, lying sheet, without any circulation at all, and that too before it had been published more than six months. It is true the Reporter had been very abusive on the Legislature and the Yankee nation in general; but so had all the papers in the State. It was no exception. It called them all manner of hard names, and styled the United States flag 'a flaunting rag—a stupendous lie,' but this was no reason the public patronage should be taken from it. The people read it, and liked it.
               After Brown had left, and Prim had started his pipe, he remarked to me, 'did you know there was another Yankee setting up business in town?'
               'No,' said I, 'Who?'
               
               'Heiberger,' he answered. 'He is in partnership with Major Pratt, manufacturing shoes. That's his trade, but we'll soon smoke him out. No Yankee can do business here long.'
               'But if he has a native partner?' said McCarty.
               'It'll break em both,' said Prim. Heiberger 'll be pushed out minus his capital in less than a year. I know what I'm talking about.'
               'But then,' said Tom-smiling, 'he is a german.'
               'Don't make a d—n bit of difference. He was in the Yankee army That's enough to damn any man in Smithville.'
               I made some inquiries about this matter, and found that Heiberger was a practical workman in the art of manufacturing shoes, and had united his capital with Major Pratt who knew nothing about the business whatever, and they had already opened a business establishment. Heiberger was in some trouble about the title to his farm which he had leased to some niggers, and thought as he was a good Conservative and had a citizen partner, he could do well. We will see how he came out.
               I was on my way to dinner when Hapsburg met me, and asked me to go to his office a moment. When seated, said he. 'Major, The colored people are very anxious to have me elected Justice of the Peace in place of Esq. Barlow 
                     deseased
                     deceased
                  . I wish to confer with you about the propriety of accepting it.'
               'Certainly,' said I. 'We will give you all the business we can, and I will take special pains to have all our lawyers throw business into your office.' I had become so accustomed to lying to Hapsburg, that I could do it now with ease, for he believed every thing we said to him. He was elected but resigned in less than three months, for he got nothing whatever to do from the white people, except to marry a couple of green Kentuckians for which he reserved one dollar in greenbacks. No we don't patronize Carpet-baggers in Smithville.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               
                  NIGGER SCHOOLS—DON'T EAT TOGETHER—BLOOD AND FIRE—CITY ELECTIONS—NIGGERS WON'T VOTE RIGHT—SECRECY—MYSTERIOUS AND GRAND.
               
               Nigger Schools! Yes our good, christian city was to be again insulted by another nigger procession and picnic. Yes they had a picnic this time, out at Squibbs grove. If it had'nt been that Doubleface and McCarty said it would not do, we certainly would have mobbed them. Our patience was exhausted and we were on the point of arming ourselves and dispersing the whole infernal thing. There were none but children in the procession, save a few bucks who acted as leaders. The little devils were singing sabbath school hymns as they passed through the streets, and nearly every one had a singing book in his hand from which he of she was reading. If the white cuticled wretches who were responsible for all this, had been in the procession, I am quite certain we could not have allowed it to pass unharmed, but there was not a white person there.
               McCarty said it was too soon to begin. The boys, he said had already run off one nigger teacher out in the country after beating him good, and burning his school house, and that was enough for a while. We mustn't put it on too thick said he. And Doubleface said we would need nigger votes next year. We must let them alone till that is passed. 'At all events,' said he, 'we must not make any public demonstration of our hatred to nigger education, till we can do it safely. We must be patient.'
               And we were patient, but oh! my countrymen, such patience! It was like boiling oil.
               We sent Charley Jamison, the local editor of the Reporter, over to the picnic grounds to take notes. 'Every Yankee,' reported he, 'both male and female in the city were there, save Heiberger, Barton and Maxwell. The young asses were organized in their various classes and recited some lessons in geography, grammar, and philosophy——' 'stop there said I,'—'are you insulting us?'
               'No:' said he, I speak the words of truth and soberness. They did positively recite, and recite well in all those branches besides United States History.'
               'Any thing about the war,' I asked.
               'Not a word. After this was done, they sang a song or two, and then addresses were delivered by Holmes, Brown, McClintock and Hapsburg. They all spoke well of the progress of the children, and urged them to persevere.
               'Did they say anything about rebels,' I asked.
               'Not a word. After the speeches, they all had dinner.'
               'Did they all eat at the same table black and white?' asked McCarty.
               'Oh no!' said Jamison. 'The whites had their own table some distance from the niggers.'
               'Then they don't eat together?' said I.
               'What do you think of the thing any how?' asked McCarty.
               'I think they'll be ahead of the white children if we don't soon get some schools under way. That's what I think,' answered the Reporter.
               The time had now come for blood and fire, if nothing else would do. Our niggers did our voting, and were fast gaining on us in intelligence. Jamison told me that from accurate data in his possession, at least three fourths of the young niggers of the city between six and twelve could read and write, and this in just three years. The first nigger school in Smithville was started in '64. If we intended to be the ruling race, we must keep the nigger in his place, and this we proposed to do at all hazards, not by educating the poor whites, as he suggested, but by keeping the niggers where they ought to be. We were not conquered yet. No, not we.
               I suggested to McCarty a secret organization for destroying the radicals and niggers; but, 'not now said that good man. Let us wait until after the city elections, and see how the niggers will vote. If they vote with us, why then we need'nt kill any of them.'
               I waited. The city elections were at hand. We had to elect a Mayor, and alderman, recorder etc., We had our candidates, and made battle. The radical candidates were all native Tennesseeans, and we didn't fear them much, but we did our best to beat them. We brought all our pressure sure to bear against the niggers, but it was just as it was at the governor's election. They were stubborn and would neither drink our whisky nor believe our promises. The only thing our people did wrong was, that our candidates, (and there were at least five for every office to be filled,) would go truckling to the Carpet-baggers and beg for their influence. There was Bill Armstrong, candidate for recorder. He had been four years in the confederate army, was the most violent of all rebels, and yet he would go sneaking, crouching, and cringing at the feet of these cutthroats, begging for their support. Ain't you ashamed of yourself Bill? But they took very little interest in the election—just enough to direct the niggers who to vote for.
               They carried the day. But as I said, their candidates were all native Tennesseeans. We soon arranged with the mayor elect to resign, and the alderman appointed our man in his place. That saved us a great deal of trouble and anxiety.
               I have said before that we were tired of nigger schools and nigger voting. I repeat it. We were. Not only that, but we intended finally to put a stop to both, unless the niggers would vote right. We had tried them twice and there were no visible signs of improvement. I consulted McCarty again. I am ready now,' said he. 'We've tried them twice. They won't vote right. I'm in for any thing provided, Major, it can be executed secretly, and as much of it as possible blamed on the radicals.'
               'That's my idea precisely,' said I. 'Come along my good friend.' Tom gathered up a small demijohn which he kept under his counter to hold up waste paper, and we went arm in arm to see Doubleface and Long. Reader, would you like to know how that good man McCarty looked? His image should be engraved in the heart of every Tennesseean. How he looked? Yes, I will tell you. He was a square made, tall, portly, bland—but perhaps, for certain prudential reasons, I had better let him remain personally unknown for the present, and I will.
               We refreshed ourselves from the demijohn several times, and after sending Bob out into the country so as to prevent his being near enough to hear us, we took a cool, deliberate, and very comprehensive survey of the whole field.
               'We know the nigger,' said McCarty.
               'We raised him,' said Randolph.
               'He's ours, and by the gods we'll rule or we'll ruin him,' said Long.
               'It's a big job,' said Stout.
               'The nigger is superstitious,' said Highflyer.
               Now Gen Highflyer was of a religious turn of mind, and contemplated turning his attention to theology.
               'The nigger is superstitious,' said he; 'and besides that he is timid and easily frightened. If some means could be devised to frighten him which would be mysterious in their execution, he might be kept away from the polls, and still we need not kill him.'
               'I have it,' said Doubleface; and he started hurriedly out saying 'wait a moment.'
               'Can't we manage some way,' said Long, 'to get some of these Yankees into a scrape so we can get a hold on them?'
               'We've tried them two years and failed, said Highflyer.
               'There are no more quiet and well behaved persons in the church than Brown and Hapsburg,' said I.
               Doubleface returned with Dan Mumps and Billy Ward. He locked the door, showed the demijohn to each of them and had them seated.
               'Dan,' said he. 'Yes, sir,' said Dan. 'We're in a tight place, and it grows tighter all the time. First, half of us could vote; now about one fifth, and the niggers do it for the balance. Besides this, we have no schools, and the young niggers are gaining ground on the white children in the matter of learning. Now, the niggers would give us no trouble about voting if there were no white scoundrels here to lead them. There would be no nigger schools if there were no white skinned devils here to teach them. Do you understand me Dan?'
               'Yes,' said Dan.
               'Now, we have tried to shame them, but there is no shame in them; we have tried to catch them at some deviltry, but we have failed in that; we have tried to get up proof of fraud against them in collecting bounties, and this too has failed. We can get no valid charge against any of them. They, or their influence one, must be destroyed. Nigger supremacy must be broken down. You are an old nigger trader. You know the nigger, his virtues, his vices and his peculiarities. You know his superstition and dread of the mysterious. Can't you help us some in this matter?'
               'It must be done secretly,' said McCarty.
               'And thoroughly, and with great pomp and ceremony,' said Highflyer.
               'If I can have the moral support of the community,' said Dan, 'I can destroy every nigger school-house and every Carpet-bagger here in less than a week.'
               'Yes, but it must not be done rapidly,' said Doubleface. It must be done in some grave, mysterious way, as though the dead had risen, or something of that kind. The cursed niggers will fight if they understand what's going on. Couldn't some kind of secret, oath-bound organization, like the Knights of the Golden Circle for instance, only more mysterious, be formed? Something that would operate on the superstition of the nigger? Have another drink,' and the demijohn was divers times turned up side down.
               'How many of the boys will join?' asked Dan.
               'Five hundred in this town,' said Doubleface, 'and thousands all over the State.'
               'Then the thing is done,' said Dan.
               'But,' said the General, 'it is dangerous, and none but trusty and tried veterans must be admitted.—Now, we don't want to be known in the matter at all except to advise, but we will always be ready for that. There must be two cardinal ideas in the organization: first, strict obedience to orders and the most profound secresy; second, when work is to be done, it must always be done by members from a distance, so that no suspicion will be aroused as to the people near the scene. If there is work in a neighboring county, our boys will go; if something is to be done here, let the boys from another county come to do it and so on.
               'It'll work,' said Dan, and he arose to leave.
               'Have something to drink,' said the General, which command both obeyed, and retired, while Highflyer cautioned them that 'as few lives as possible be taken.'
               'But clean the thing out,' said Long.
               We then considered the matter further, and at once opened a correspondence in cipher with several distinguished Confederate Generals.
               'There is one thing,' said Stout, 'that ought to be understood about this matter. The first experiments ought to be made on our own people, so as to give out the idea that it is not a political organization, or we may suffer for it.'
               'Good idea,' said Randolph. 'Try it on Pete Yates; he is an old hunter and wont be frightened.'
               'No, said Long, 'but he'll shoot, and we don't want any of our boys hurt.'
               'Try it on Jake West the old collier,' said Highflyer, 'he'll spread the news faster, and make it a thousand times worse than any man in the county, and that will tend to make it mysterious and grand.'
               'Agree,' said all. 'Jack's in for it,' and we took further refreshments.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               
                  KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE—CHURCH MATTERS—HOW CARPET-BAGGERS LIVE AT HOME.
               
               Fanny was married. Yes, Fanny was now Mrs. Harry Benton, and the 
                     haypiest
                     happiest
                  
                  
                     mostal
                     mortal
                   alive, Kentucky and Tennessee united in the holy bonds of matrimony. Oh! blessed consummation. Immortal union. As I saw her stand in her bridal robes at the hymenial altar, with that noble young Kentuckian at her side, my memory ran back along the lanes of time to pick up the flowers of Kentucky's history, and I wove them into beautiful garlands with those of Tennessee. Who would not have felt the pride of his declining years glow afresh when seeing his pet daughter married to one of Kentucky's gallant sons? Those Kentuckians are a noble, a grand people. They manage their own business there. They are not cursed with nigger witnesses, nigger voters and nigger officeholders, nor nigger schools—nor anything in the line of schools much. No; in Kentucky the nigger is in his normal sphere. There are no Carpet-baggers there to lead the poor devils astray. (I wonder what they will do when the 15th amendment is adopted. But I suppose they will revolute and secede. That's what they ought to do, and they know their business.)
               Early in this year, 1868, Hapsburg had complained to me about the coldness of our church toward him and his family. I talked with Mr. Spellman on the subject, and we thought it wise to call on Hapsburg's family, and we went—the first time I was ever in his house, and the last forever. We approached the house in such a way as to have a view of a portion of the kitchen, before entering the door. I saw a woman there feeding a fowl, a chicken, as I supposed, with three or four children standing around her looking on. I supposed of course she was a servant. We rapped at the door—there was no bell. Hapsburg came to receive us with a New York Tribune in his hand, and very politely handed us in and gave us seats. The room was small, but I must say neatly and very tastefully arranged. The furniture was very common. There was a center-table almost covered with books—quite too many books I thought for a center-table. There were the poems of Scott, Pope, Milton, Shakespeare, Southey, Coleridge, Addison, Young, 
                     Schelley
                     Shelley
                  , Byron, Burns, and I don't know how many other English, besides American authors, and a number of prose works. A piano stood in one corner; half a dozen plain cane seat chairs; a small stand in another corner laden with books, and a very cleanly swept brussels carpet completed the list of furniture in the room. He was very glad to see us, he said. 'Better late than never.'
               His wife soon came in and expressed pleasure at seeing us, although she thought we 'might have called sooner.' I saw at a glance she was the same woman I had seen feeding the fowl, and I told her so.
               'Yes,' she said, 'the children have so little company that they have an unusual fondness for pets. They have a blind pigeon which requires a great deal of attention, and I have 
                     ts
                     its
                   feed for them. Poor thing, it can't see to feed itself.'
               'Why don't you let the servants feed it?' I asked.
               'We don't keep any servants,' she said. 'With the help of our daughter and the little boys, I am able to do my own work.'
               Just then, a red faced boy with dark eyes came running to the door, which opening quietly, he said in a low tone, 'Mother, Andy Johnson's out of his cage.'
               The company all laughed, while Mrs. H. left the room. When she returned, which was in a very few seconds, she saw we were laughing about Andy Johnson being out of his cage. She explained by saying 'the children have a name for each one of their pets. The blind pigeon is Andy Johnson, and when he gets out of his cage he can't see to get back. They have a dog named Gen. Grant, a pig named Jeff Davis and one Bob Lee. Their pigeons they call Abe Lincoln, Fanny Fern, Schuyler Colfax, Anna Dickinson, Cady Stanton, etc. Everything with them must have a name.'
               As this was the first and only Carpet-bagger's house I have ever been in, I took notes of everything I saw and heard, for I doubt not my Southern readers will like to know just how these creatures live at home. I took this family to be a fair sample of the tribe.
               Mrs. H. was a tall, graceful woman, with a countenance fresh as a May morning, and a dark eye of real, genuine beauty. When I saw it fired up as I afterwards did, I could not help admiring it, although it lit a female Yankee face. Her hair, though she must have been thirty-five, was abundant—neither brown nor black, but about midway between them, wearing a beautiful tiful brilliant gloss. Her face was very expressive—not lean, not full. Her features were marked, yet gentle, and very womanly; her forehead full and large; her hand and fingers beautiful and tapered, but dark, and looked as though they labored hard. She appeared perfectly at ease in our company, although she had just come from the kitchen, and was wearing a calico dress. Her conversation was modest, intelligent and sometimes sparkling. She did not like Shakespeare, she said, for he was so tedious; Byron too sentimental, and Milton too wordy. She liked Young—he was melancholy and thoughtful. She liked Pope, occasionally he was philosophical; and Burns, for he was pathetic and sparkling. She was especially fond of Mrs. Hemans, Sigourney, and Longfellow and Whittier—the latter two, she said, could get out of the beaten paths of their fathers. But she was not very fond of poetry, she said, unless it was rich and 
                     discriptive
                     descriptive
                  .
               'Did you ever read Uncle Tom's Cabin?' I asked.
               'Oh yes, I read everything I can get.
               'What's your opinion of that?' I asked.
               'When I read it,' said she. 'I thought it was overdrawn, but since I came South, I have changed my opinion of it. I think there are more Le Grees than St. Clairs here.'
               'Your opinion of us is not as favorable as I had hoped to find,' said Mr. Spellman.
               'My opinion is the result of observation and a very painful experience,' said she, dropping her eyes in thoughtful mood.
               'I hope you won't get angry and leave the church, said he, laughing. At this her face became suffused with a brightening red, and the woman shone through all reserve. I can never forget that face, as she said in slow, measured but impassioned words:
               'Mr. Spellman, I have been well raised, and have always had the advantages of good society. My husband has never been accused of any ungentlemanly act, so far as I know. We have been constant in our attendance at your church for three years. We have tried to behave well and be good christians. Yet no lady of the church has ever yet spoken to me in church, or called on me at home. They do not even look at me except to sneer. Why is this?' and the tears dropped fast upon her little white apron, as she looked a pitiful look full in her husband's face a moment and then dropped her eyes again to the floor. I did really pity the poor creature, for I felt that her trouble was real. I am always touched when I see a woman suffer pain. Said Mr. Spellman in reply to her question.
               'Mrs. Hapsburg, as you are candid with me. I will be as candid with you. This treatment of which you complain, while it is very wrong and greatly to be deplored, is not because you are Mrs. Hapsburg; not because you are not a good, christian woman; not be cause you are not well behaved; but it is because your husband was in the Federal army. Their prejudices are strong, and it will require a long time to remove them. I will do all I can in this way, but it is a thankless and doubtful labor.'
               'My husband,' she added, 'has always told me to be patient; that in time it would grow better, and by living proper lives, we would yet be respected and taken into society. I have taken his advice. I have been patient. But now at the end of so long a time, my only neighbors are the few families of Northern people here, and the colored people. The blacks are very kind to us, and I believe would do anything they could for me. When Eddie was sick last fall, and I was worn out with watching, and Mr. Hapsburg tired out from the loss of sleep, no one ever called except Mr. Ferguson's family, and now they have ceased their visits. Do you think Mr. Spellman, it will ever improve? and the tears started again.
               'I can't say how that will be, but we must all do our duty. I will try and have some of the ladies call on you, and I wish to caution you now to be prudent when they come, if they do, and treat them well.'
               'Don't ask them to come on my account,' she quickly replied. 'If their own sense of propriety, to say nothing of their christian faith, does not impel them to acts of common courtesy. I prefer that you do not insist on their calling.'
               'Will you receive them kindly if they come?' asked he.
               'Certainly,' said she, 'and would be happy to have them call, but I would be thinking all the time they were as automatons, and not as living, active christians; and I think it quite likely I should feel that I had not performed my whole duty until I had told them so.'
               'Where is your daughter?' I asked; for I wanted to see her too.
               'She is engaged at present. She is writing some letters for an old colored lady, who has relatives in Virginia.'
               'Are you troubled much in that way?' Spellman asked.
               'Oh, we don't think it any trouble. The poor creatures are illiterate, and they enjoy correspondence very much. There is not a week day in which either Emma or I do not write or read one or more letters for them.
               'They pay you of course,' said I.
               'They always offer to pay,' said she, 'but we never think of accepting anything. I have a little black girl here—a real Topsy—and I am teaching her to read along with the little boys. It is very amusing to see so parti-colored a class, but she learns readily.'
               'Do you teach a nigger,' said I astonished, 'in your own family?'
               'Oh, yes.' said she, as though it were perfectly right. 'The little thing has no mother, and I suppose I must supply the place.'
               Just then the young Hapsburg's came in and were introduced. Emma, Charlie, Eddie, Willie, and the baby, Grant. Emma was a modest girl of fifteen, wearing a short, light colored calico school dress. The boys were great, lubberly fellows, red faced, with heads as large as pumpkins. They all clustered round their father and mother, like so many frightened chickens.
               'They are shy of strangers' said Spellman.
               Yes, said the mother, they see so few persons who speak to them, that they are not at all familiar with strangers.'
               'Will Miss Emma favor us with some music?' asked Mr. Spellman.
               'My fingers are a little rough preparing dinner, but I will try?' said the girl bashfully going to the piano stool.
               'Why, you Yankees, are a singular people,' said I, addressing Mrs. H. 'Does your daughter do housework?'
               'Oh yes,' replied she. We teach all our children to work. 'I couldn't get along at all without Emma. She relieves me a great deal. She can bake as good bread and pies, and make as good steak as I, and she is only fifteen.'
               'And what do the boys do?'
               'They are real fine fellows,' said she, looking at them that mother's look which every man born of a woman remembers. They carry in wood and water, help set the table, and feed the poultry 
                     ond
                     and
                   pigs.
               'The baby don't work too, I suppose, does he?' Spellman asked, laughing at the idea.
               'Oh yes,' said she, laughing heartily as she looked at the captain. 'The baby is one of my most serviceable helps. He always wakens his father in the morning by pulling his nose.'
               We listened to the Elfin, Dixie, and a few other short pieces of music, which for so young a 
                     preformer
                     performer
                  , were well played—so said Spellman. I of course agreed that that was so, but to tell the truth, I don't know the Star Spangled Banner from the Devils Dream. Mr. Spellman suggested that it was time to leave, to which both Mr. and Mrs. H. objected, saying dinner was 'nearly ready,' and Emma was directed to go and 'attend to it.' But, we could not stay and so stated. Mrs. H. then left the room a moment—but a moment—and returned. Hapsburg, who until now had taken but little part in the conversation, said as he patted his baby's cheeks:
               'Gentlemen, I am truly pleased that you have favored us with this call. We have felt our share of that common pride which distinguishes man from the lower orders of living things, and I must say we have had much private grievance that the outside side world knows not of. It was a delicate matter, and we thought time would remove all barriers to our comfort and success. I have often wished that some member of the church would call on us that we might talk over these unpleasant matters under our own roof. This is the first opportunity of the kind we have had. For myself, I am out in the rough and tumble of the world and men are compelled to speak to me. It is not so with a woman. She has her little private trials and disappointments which none but herself knows or feels. Her circle is home. She sees nothing of the rush and whirl of life,—nothing to chase away her melancholy, her heart-aches and domestic monotony, as a man has But when society is lively, cheerful and reciprocal, she has a great relief from the seclusion of home, and the drudge of household duties. When, however, by force of public opinion, she is compelled to wear out her life within the narrow precincts of her own house-yard, and she is compelled to feel that the great world around her laughs at her calamities and mocks when her fear cometh, she becomes cramped; her nature revolts; her womanhood rebels; and she is not to be blamed if she holds society responsible for her pains.—But there are some refreshments as you will not stay for dinner.'
               And there was Emma with a waiter, cake and wine; Charley with pie; Eddie with pitcher and water; and Willie with goblets. We enjoyed them all very much, and while doing so we learned that Emma had baked the cake.
               'I carried in the wood,' said Eddie.
               'I brought the cobs to start the fire with,' said Willie.
               'And what did Charley do?' said I.
               'I made the fire,' he answered.
               'And the baby?' asked Spellman.
               'He superintended the proceedings,' replied the mother.
               As is usual on such occasions, we mingled our voices in reading and prayer before we returned. On our way home, a short distance from Hapsburg's house, we saw a nigger man and woman (they used to belong to Mr. Black) standing near a black, burned mass of lumber. We stopped and inquired what they were looking at. 'Our house was burned down last night,' replied the man. 'All we had's done burned up good; I had jes forty dollars in greenbax done up in a old sack, an laid away to make de nex payment on de lot; but she's all done burned up good now. I was down at de shop, an Lucy, she was at de factry, an nobody wasn't at home, when de fire broke out. All our close is dun burnt up too. We has nuffen left. Cap'n Hapsburg brought us two blankets, or we wouldn't had no cuver to sleep under.'
               'Dey is sich good people,' said the woman.' Dar's der boys a comin now, an I bet dey's got suffin for us.'
               'We looked back, and sure enough there were the three boys, with a basket and bundle. We waited till they came up. They all looked at us but did not speak a word. They walked up to the niggers. 'Uncle Jim,' said Charlie, 'mother sent this basket, and said it was all she could send to-day.' 'And here,' said Willie, 'is some clothes for your baby, aunt Lucy.' 'And here's one of mother's dresses for you too,' said Eddie, 'and a pair of father's pants for uncle Jim,' and the little fellows turned directly towards home.
               'Spellman,' said I, as we drove on, 'either my heart is wrong, or there is something wrong in our society. Why should such people be proscribed from all social and religious intercourse?'
               'Your heart is right,' said he, 'but there is that between the Southern people, and the Yankees, more especially if they have been in the Federal army, that will keep them apart for a generation or more. The very children of the South are being daily taught to hate the whole Yankee nation.' And we drove on.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               
                  NIGGER CONVENTION—HAPSBURG SHOWS HIS HAND—COUNTY COURT COMES TO OUR RESCUE—THE JUDGE VS. THE PARSON.
               
               The spring elections of '68 were at hand. Another exhibition of the true character of the Carpet-bagger and his trade was to be made in Smithville soon, and our people were justly very much excited. We are always excited at election times, especially so since the war. Our county offices had to be again filled. A Carpet-bag convention was to come off, and I was moving about to take notes. We have one peculiar trait in our character. We loathe and hate the Yankees and everything they do. We are grossly insulted at all their shameful acts, but yet, we never let an opportunity pass for seeing the whole of their proceedings, without taking advantage of it. And just so here. I was determined to see as much of this convention as possible without being caught at it.
               I heard a great howling and yelling on the streets among the niggers. 'Rah for Stoner!' Rah for Holmes!' could be heard when I turned on to Randolph street—the principal street in the city—and there I saw at least five hundred niggers in a body, like so many black porkers in a feeding pen, marching pell mell up street, shouting 'Rah for Stoner!' There was a man on horseback in front of them, whom I supposed to be Holmes, the nigger parson, and I hurried to McCarty's for the purpose of advising a mob. But McCarty informed me that I was mistaken. The man on horseback was John Stoner. He said there was no other white man in the crowd. Brown happened in just after me, and the crowd came past the door.
               'Now look at your niggers,' said I, and see that white scoundrel riding at their head. How long is this thing to continue?'
               'Just as long as you gentlemen are not willing to let men freely exercise the common rights of freemen,' said Brown.
               Oh! if I had dared, how I would have enjoyed a good pull at his nose.
               'Make that white villain get away,' said I 'Our people cannot endure that and they won't.'
               'Oh, yes they will,' said the insulting scoundrel. 'He is a native Tennesseean and was as good a rebel as any of you. You will see at least a dozen of your high-toned gentlemen at the convention to-day, asking those despised colored men to nominate and vote for them for office. You damn the nigger but you want his vote. You would hang the Carpet-bagger, but you want his influence to elect your men to office.'
               'But that man on the horse,' said I, greatly excited, and examining my Deringer freely—'that troubles me; I can't endure that.'
               'Thank God,' said Brown, 'he is not a Yankee. McCarty, I want a pair of Heiberger & Pratt's fine sewed boots.'
               'I don't keep any of their goods,' said Tom. 'I don't patronize their house. I get all my goods from Cincinnati.'
               Brown left, and I rejoiced over this little piece of revenge. It was all I could get. No: Tom did'nt keep their shoes.
               'McCarty,' said I, 'send Charley Jamison, local editor, out to that convention.'
               'That's all arranged,' said he.
               I went to the door to see it that fellow on the horse was too far for me to shoot at him, but I saw I could not reach him. I met Dr. Radcliffe at the door. He said he was going to that convention to see if he could not get a nomination for tax-collector. 'Come in,' said I. He came in and we were seated.
               'Dr. Radcliffe,' said I, 'you are a traitor, and a disgrace to your wife and children. You are a native Tennesseean; married into a Tennessee family; have been educated to Southern honor and 
                     deceacy
                     decency
                  . Now, for such a man as you to appear before a nigger convention and ask their votes, is a disgrace to southern civilization. More than this—' 'Hold!' said he, 'not quite so fast. How many speeches did you make to niggers last summer when you wanted them to vote for Etheridge? How many times did you drink whisky with niggers, and at the same bar?'
               'No matter what I did.' I replied, most heartily disgusted; 'I am speaking of the principle of the thing,' and I walked indignantly out.'
               Jamison reported that evening that Dr. Radcliff, Col. Snow, Esq. Danbridge, Major Spurlock, Dan Cross, Dick Shellabarger, Captain Freeman, Felix Sharp and about a dozen other native Tennesseeans were out at the convention asking for nominations—some for tax-collector and some for sheriff. 'They all made speeches,' said he, 'and each one abused the others for some mean trick he had played on the colored man. No purer men than they, to judge by their remarks, and no better friend to the nigger, ever lived. When Shellabarger, Truman and Sharp began to speak of their friendship to the 
                     colered
                     colored
                   man, the gentlemen of color politely reminded them that 'they had a dogond poor way of showin ther frenship when dey hung five niggers in '56, chopped off their heads and stuck em on fence stakes.' That cured those ambitious gentlemen very suddenly of all aspirations for office.'
               'Who were nominated?' I asked.
               'Jno Stoner for sheriff and Holmes for tax-collector.'
               'Were any speeches made by the Carpet-baggers?'
               'Yes; one that will astonish you, when I tell you of it. Hapsburg spoke with more earnestness than I ever heard him use before. He said, and these are his words, for I took them down at the time. 'The political horison is dim with dangers. The battle of '61 is to be fought over again. The two great parties are silently but certainly organizing for the great conflict. The party which inaugurated and conducted the rebellion, is almost imperceptibly marshaling its scattered forces, and in the great campaign of 1868, we will have to fight the combined hosts of all the enemies of the Union party of America. I am already mustered for the war. I am an enemy to modern Democracy. It has proved a costly party to this country. The high principled Conservative party of Tennessee, forgetting all its professions and pledges, is rushing madly into Democracy and ruin. There is now no Conservative party in Tennessee. It will be Democratic and Republican; and you may rest assured, I am too well versed in the corruption and treachery of the Democracy to be found drilling in its ranks.'
               'Did Hapsburg make that speech?' I asked in surprise.
               'He did,' said Jamison.
               'Why d—n the fellow, has he found us out?' said I in some bewilderment. 'How'll we manage that?' But happily Stout came in just then. I told him what I had heard of Hapsburg.
               'I told you so,' said he; 'I told you all you would get your fingers burnt with that fellow yet. Now you see what fools you were. You all have petted and fondled him, till he has discovered your treachery, and now he is thrice armed against us.'
               'Send for Long and Doubleface,' said I, wiping my face with the tail of Stout's linen coat. 'Send for them; this case must be met,' and they came.
               'Discard him forever,' said Long. 'All our forces must be brought to bear against him. We can destroy him if we unite.'
               'I thought he was a Copperhead,' said Doubleface.
               'You are to blame for this, Doubleface,' said I, very much chagrined.
               'We are not hurt,' said he; 'we've got him in a tight place; the Radicals won't have him, and we won't. Then of course his influence is nothing.'
               'That man's influence must be destroyed,' said Long. 'To day he is the most popular man in the county of Middlebury.'
               'But,' said the General, 'our people despise turncoats.'
               'Hapsburg is no turncoat. He has uniformly opposed the Democrats and always claimed to be a National Republican.'
               'Well, we can make the people think so,' said Doubleface.
               'The people are not all fools,' said Long.
               'They are nigh unto it,' said Stout.
               'My idea is the correct one,' said Long. 'Destroy him. Let us pledge ourselves to that in a social glass. McCarty, where's the demijohn?' We drank and separated.
               The election—another repetition of former disgusting scenes—resulted in favor of Holmes and Stoner. There were just seventeen of our own people candidates for each of the offices. Many persons, especially the Northern people imagine that we are greedy for office in the South: but that is another of their malicious slanders on the character of our citizens. No, we don't want office, but we want to keep Carpet-baggers and native radicals out. That's the plain truth.
               Now we did not care much about the election of Stoner, for, as I have before had occasion to remark, we have never been sold in Smithville yet by a native Tennesseean. But that sneaking, stinking, skulking devil; that fiend, that serpent, that monster, that—that—nigger parson! to have him to collect our taxes and insult our people, to steal our money—plunder our property, fill his deep pockets with our substance. That cutthroat—adventurer—spoiler, defiler that has been spewed out of some Northern penitentiary to ride over the high-toned gentlemen of the South—Never! Never! Blood knee deep will flow through the streets of Smithville first. What shall we do? Murder him? Skin him alive? Burn him? Make the niggers butcher him? I asked Doubleface.
               'Your a fool,' said the General. 'Much Robertson hath made thee mad.'
               'But what the devil's to be done? We can't stand that.'
               'Be still,' said he. 'That's the easiest thing in the world. You know he must give a very heavy bond before taking the office. It would ruin any man to go on his bond. We've got him there.'
               'Aye, that is a fact I hadn't thought of that' said I. 'That's so.' We've got him there. Let us take something.
               Our worshipful County Court has charge of official bonds for Country offices. What an admirable institution is that good old County Court. The Sheriff's case was first called. 'Whom do you offer as bondsmen?' said the Judge.
               'Samuel Brown, and John McClintock,' said the newly elected Sheriff.
               'Be sworn gentlemen;' said the Judge, and both were duly sworn.
               'How much are you worth Samuel Brown?'
               'Fifteen thousand dollars in real estate, and ten thousand in Bank stock,' answered Brown.
               'John McClintock, how much are you worth?'
               'Twenty thousand dollars in real estate, and fifteen thousand in bonds of the government.'
               'The court cannot receive anything but real estate as security. Fifteen for Brown, and twenty for McClintock, thirty five thousand. The bond is in fifty thousand dollars. You must produce further security,' said the Judge.
               Stoner ran about for an hour or two, and finally produced Pete Spooner and James Hawthorn, whitewashed rebels. They completed his bond and he was sworn in. The case of Holmes was then called. The court room—which was a very large one was crowded almost to suffocation. Every body was anxious to see the Judge defeat the parson.
               Hapsburg represented the parson as attorney. 'May it please the court said he, the situation of affairs here has taken me by surprise. I had supposed that the court would require no further security on the sheriffs bond than Brown and McClintock, as the practice heretofore has been not to require heavy security when the officer himself is the owner of considerable estate as is the case here. With such impression, I had expected that the other two gentlemen Spooner and Hawthorn and myself would be 
                     sufficent
                     sufficient
                   for Holmes' bond. In that event we could offer a bond of fifty thousand dollars. Will the court accept such a bond?'
               A vote was taken, and all voted no.'
               'Then said Hapsburg, I move the court for further time of ten days in which to file a good bond.'
               The motion was discussed with great warmth by the members of the court each one declaring that he was not governed by any political view whatever, and it was finally decided by our vote, that time be given.
               Holmes and his friends worked very hard to fill the bond. They visited every business man in the city, and some rich farmers in the country. But the answer was the same every where;—either 'I don't go on any body's bond,' or 'it will destroy my business.' And when the court was again convened on the eleventh day, Holmes failed to make his bond. Of course he could not be inducted into office without bond. Sam Zimmerman, a confederate soldier, was immediately installed with a bond of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Ten times that amount could have been raised in thirty minutes. We all stand up to our friends here. That was work enough for one day, thanks to our well regulated court, and we chastised divers bottle necks in commemoration of the glorious event. I think I heard at least one hundred men say that evening that they were done with Hapsburg for taking the part of that infernal old nigger thief.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               
                  GOVERNMENT INJUSTICE—THE NEW DENTIST—MYSTERIOUS—GHOSTS—JAKE WEST'S STORY—KUKLUX—BURTON FOUND OUT.
               
               It was quite mysterious to me and to the people of Smithville generally how the Carpet-baggers managed to remain in our midst so long under our course of treatment. But they did remain, and up to the time where of I now write, and seemed to be prospering. All but Pettibone and Coole had become real estate owners, and passed about the streets with their heads up. They are certainly a patient people. We would have been wonderfully gratified had some one or more of them been guilty of any one of our charges against them, for then we could have laid violent hands on them, and driven them out by force. In this, however, we were disappointed. We could not even learn that they had offered an insult to a nigger. And strange to say, we could never see any of them associating of speaking with niggers on the street. We all knew very well they did all these things; we knew they were plundering, robbing and insulting our people, but the great trouble with us was, that we never could find any one who was willing to swear to it.
               If the Yankee government had just kept hands off and left these fellows to our tender mercies, we could have managed them much better.—Right there was the secret of it all. The government (I mean the Congress—for Andy would have cleaned them out) kept them in official position, and we seriously doubted the propriety of butting ourselves against Uncle Sam any more than was absolutely necessary to keep the peace. Yes, at least half these scoundrels held some one or more government offices. This gave them moral strength. There was little Small, the blue coat. He had no office. We broke him up in less than a year, and he left, Pettibone was bursted in less than a month, but soon obtained a government office. That, and that alone kept him here. Roorback, although though a rank Copperhead, could stand our treatment only six months. Heiberger, a dirt-eating Conservative, invested all his money in land and business—and he even had a native partner. He could get no trade here. Our merchants would not patronize him although his goods were better than we could get elsewhere, and cheaper. He had to sell out to his partner at a ruinous sacrifice and leave the city. His partner at once began to thrive, and is now doing a good business on what he learned from the Dutch Yankee. So the reader will readily see the injustice of the government towards us in keeping these vermin here. Had the Federal patronage been more worthily bestowed, we would have been rid of them in two years. But we had done a good work under the circumstances, and still had hope that in the end we would be alone again, with not a Yankee within a thousand miles.
               All this, and much more of the same kind, was passing through my mind, as I sat smoking in the parlor the morning after the failure of Holmes to make his bond. It was such a relief to know that we were rid of him, that many other pleasant reminiscences presented themselves in reflection. I was thinking of these things, I say, when little Nettie McFlimsey came skipping into the parlor, apparently very much delighted at something. She came up to where I sat, and pulling her lips as wide apart as she could get them with one hand at each lip, said, in mumbling sound: 'Look here, Major Bascom.' And she put her exposed teeth so close to my face, that I could see nothing in the world but teeth. I supposed there was something about her mouth she wished me to see. I put on my glasses and looked. There was a kind of harness made of cotton thread attached to her upper teeth, and a hard band in front of the lower teeth, very much resembling the breech strap on buggy harness; and this was either tied to the lower teeth or the teeth were led to it.
               'Well,' said I, 'what's the matter? were your teeth going to run away?
               'Don't you think I look much better than when you last saw me?' she said, stepping back a few feet and closing her mouth to let me look at her face in its natural position.
               'Yes,' I think you do, I replied.
               Now Nettie's face was disfigured by her upper teeth extending out 
                     beyound
                     beyond
                   the lower ones at least three quarters of an inch. 'Yes,' I repeated; 'Nettie your mouth is greatly improved. What have you been doing to it?' She again showed me her harness.
               'Dr. Mellville has done it,' she said. He says he can have my teeth in proper shape in two more weeks.
               'Ah,' said I, 'who is Dr. Mellville?
               'He's the new Doctor,' she said 'Oh! he is such a nice man.'
               At this moment, Mrs. McFlimsy, Mrs. Randolph and Mrs. Bascom came smiling into the parlor.
               
               'Pa,' said my wife, 'see how much these ladies are improved in appearance.' I looked over my spectacles and surveyed the ladies.
               'Well yes,' said I, 'you do look remarkably well this morning. I suppose you must have news of importance.'
               'Let him see your teeth,' said Mrs. Bascom.
               'Ah,' said I, 'there's the secret.—New teeth. You have been to see the new doctor too, eh!'
               'Yes,' said Mrs. McFlimsey.' 'He is the best dentist I ever saw. This is the fourth set of teeth I have had made, and I never could get any to suit me but these. Just look at Nettie's mouth. Her teeth almost meet now. She can bite a thread, which she never could do before. And he is so much of a gentleman. He did not ask a cent until I had tried them and was satisfied with them. He only charges half what Dr. Hartshorn does, and his work is so much better. I know at least twenty ladies who are getting him to make sets for them.'
               'I saw his wife,' observed Mrs. Randolph. 'She is a real sweet little woman. They are a mighty nice couple.'
               'Pa,' said my love of a wife. 'I must get Dr. Mellville into my mouth and Sue needs some work done on her teeth too.'
               That then was the next thing in order, and Mrs. B. retired to prepare themselves for visiting Dr. Mellville.
               'La!' Major Bascom,' said Mrs. McFlimsey, as my wife retired with Miss Nettie, 'this is a strange world. I do think we have fallen on evil times. It really seems that God is sending us strong delusions that we may believe a lie and be damned. There are the strangest stories afloat that you ever heard of. I hear that night before last in Somerville county, and last night about fifteen miles down the river, there was some supernatural visitation.' (My spectacles dropped at this point). Well?' said I. Oh, they say they were the awfullest looking creatures that ever visited the earth. They are the spirits of the dead, they say. They were about fifty feet high, mounted on great white horses, as large as a small house. They were dressed in something white just like a cloud, and their hats which were ten feet high, were filled with flaming fire. They speak in strange, almost unutterable sentences—meaningless to mortals—and one gives command in a voice which seems like thunder. They blow lightning out of their mouths. Nobody saw them coming, or going. They are just there, and that's all anybody knows about them. They come in an instant, and vanish like light when the lamp is blown out. The niggers are flocking into town by thousands, telling the most wonderful stories any mortal ever heard. They are frightened nearly out of their wits. They call them ghosts—of the Confederate soldiers. And poor old Jake West came running into town before daylight this morning, a badly frightened as the niggers. He says the world is on its last legs sure; he says he saw three hundred and forty seven thousand ghosts of Confederate soldiers, four hundred feet high, riding white horses as long as a sycamore tree; he says they are sure enough ghosts; his fence caught fire from their breath. And now he says all West Tennessee and Mississippi are raging with unquenchable fire; he says he shot at them five hundred and thirty five times, and they would catch his balls and throw them back at his feet; he had only a quarter of a pound of powder and when that was exhausted, he came to town for more; he says they came and went at his place just seven hundred times in twenty minutes.' Here the poor woman seemed almost exhausted. I handed her a fan which she used violently.'
               'They call them Kuklux,' said Mrs. Randolph.
               'And they've come to drive out Yankees and nigger teachers,' said Mrs. McFlimsy.
               'And to keep the niggers from voting,' said Mrs. Randolph.
               'Well, they are a singular kind of visitors,' said I.
               'Oh! they say they are sure enough ghosts,' said Mrs. McFlimsy, still fanning herself very rapidly.
               Mrs. Bascom and Sue being now ready, we started to find the new dentist. We found him a very affable, dignified gentleman, and from his freedom of exercise, and quick, gentle and skillful use of instruments, as well as his practical, common sense view of what the mouth and teeth need to keep them healthy, I was well satisfied he was by great odds the most thorough master of his art I ever met. Mrs. B. and Sue were delighted with him. And his amiable, lovely wife, who happened to be present in the little parlor adjacent to the office, was a finished lady. She played and sang for us several beautiful pieces, and Sue remarked quietly to her mother that she had never heard those pieces so well performed before. Of course, Mrs. Dr. Mellville was specially invited to call on us.
               'After you call on me,' she politely replied.
               The doctor took an impression for a full set for Mrs. B. after showing her samples of his work, and referring to twenty of the most respectable ladies in the city. He examined Sue's mouth, recommended the extraction of one front tooth, and the filling of a back one. 'The front tooth,' said the doctor 'is greatly in the way of the others, and if it were out I could soon draw the others into a more regular order, and entirely fill up the space left by the missing one, by more equally dividing the spaces between the others.' He was permitted to do as he advised. Sue wanted to take chloroform. 'No,' said he. 'You will hardly know what I am doing until your tooth is shown to you. I do not approve of chloroform. She was difficult to persuade. He asked her to let him examine the tooth again before taking any further steps. He seemed to be reconnoitering about the tooth with his instruments a moment then turned again to the table. 'I 
                     muts
                     must
                   have chloroform Doctor,' said she. 'Hardly,' said he smiling, and he handed the extracted tooth to her. She was to return the next morning to have the back tooth pulled, and the order for Mrs. Bascom a full set was left, with the understanding that if they did suit her she was not to take them. While we remained in the Doctor's office and parlor, six of our best ladies called to get work done.
               On our way home, we called at Burton's and had some ice cream which we enjoyed while saying a great many nice things about the new doctor and his wife. We were just leaving when Brown come in and handed Burton a very large fat envelope heavily franked and endorsed. I believed it was from Washington, and it attracted my attention. Harry saw me looking at the package and I observed his color changing. I looked closer and saw it indorsed 'Paymaster General's Office, Official Business.'
               'What's that?' I asked. Harry grew red, and then pale.
               'What is that?' I repeated. 'Oh some business papers,' he replied. But as he was going to lay it away, his hand become nervous and a paper dropped out of the envelope, and fell neat my feet. As it fell it partially opened. There, in very large letters were the words 'United States of America.' I picked it up. My curiosity was aroused. Mrs. B. and Sue came hurriedly to my side and looked at the paper. I read it.
               Reader, what do you think that paper was! It was the Commission of Captain Harry Burton, of the 8th regiment of Massachusetts volunteers, dated May 1861. I was going to tear the infernal thing up. Brown caught my arm. Burton was a brave federal soldier, said the wretch, and this is his commission. Don't harm that paper.
               Mrs. B. shed fears and went out. She looked, at Brown and smiled. Brown looked as innocent as a spring lamb. Burton began to laugh; I began to swear, and spit and walk across the room pounding my cane very heavily on the floor, while I arranged my hat at least five times in ten seconds.
               'Burton,' 'you're a mean, low, dirty, lying, thieving Yankee villain. How dared you so betray my family?' and I made a rush towards him; but Brown was again in my way. Then came Fanny running and 
                     screming
                     screaming
                  . She caught my arm. 'Why Pa!' cried she, 'don't take on so. I knew all the time that Harry was a federal captain. I'm sure he was stationed here three weeks in '63. You needn't be so particular about the Yankees; you borrowed money six times from Judge Brown, and there isn't a Yankee in Smithville who ain't just as respectable as we are:' and she went panting to her brute of a husband nestling under his arm which he gently placed about her waist. I looked at her; then at him; next at Brown; then at him again as the fiend stood there with his arm encircling my daughter.
               The people heard the confusion and began to gather in. I fixed my hat again, took a better hold of my cane, and left the room at a very rapid pace for the police. But the police said they could not do anything for me. I saw the city Recorder, the Mayor, the Judge, McCarty; I saw everybody, but everybody said I was sold, and there was but one remedy—to run the wretch out of town. I punished a good deal of whisky and tobacco that day, and my home was not so pleasant as it had been. My wife was for once in her life in a very bad humor. She was hurt, she was mortified; and she prayed God to rid the world of Yankees in just as bloody a manner as He pleased; she didn't care a button how the thing was done.
               Every thing that Fanny had about the house was immediately sent to her with directions for her never to return, and she obeyed. She did not return.
               In about one month thereafter Burton found it to his advantage to dispose of his establishment, and he left for more congenial climes; where I neither know nor care.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               
                  PETTIBONE KUKLUXED—THE FIRE OF '61 REKINDLED—PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN—WORK—THE SPLIT—JUSTICE—STREET FIGHT.
               
               Mrs. Bascom was delighted with her new teeth. Several ladies called to congratulate her, as well as to show their own. The new doctor was all the go, and his work and prices as well as his gentlemanly conduct, was the theme of conversation in all respectable circles, especially where there was any dental work to be done, and that was in nearly every family. And his dentifrices too. That was so fine. It kept the teeth so clean and white. The doctor was a very valuable acquisition to our population, and we were proud of him.
               Ladies will talk, it is said, whether they have teeth or not. After the subject of dentistry was exhausted. Mrs. Long remarked that one of the Yankees came near doing Smithville a great service last night.'
               'How's that?' I asked.
               'Three shots were fired at Barton,' said she, 'but the brush was too thick and they missed him.'
               'His time'll come yet,' said Mrs. Stout.
               'That long legged pettibone won't trouble us any more,' said Mrs. McFlimsey. 'He's gone good, sure enough.'
               'Is he killed sure enough? Oh! I'm so glad.'
               'When?—how?' all asked eagerly.
               'Oh,' said Mrs. McF. quite unconcerned, 'the Kuklux took him off the train a few days ago down below Nashville, and hung him, and then threw him into Duck river.'
               'Then we won't have any more of his wooden nutmegs,' said Mrs. Long and the ladies all laughed heartily at the 'joke on the Yankee.'
               'We're getting rid of them mighty fast,' said Mrs. McF. 'They shot at the nigger teacher out at Bullock's coaling last Saturday night, but missed him. They cowhided him on Sunday, and done drove him out of the country on Monday; and they burnt a nigger school-house at Dryden yesterday, and one at Calhoun Tuesday night. Oh, they're doing good work everywhere. Gen. Bourton's at the head of it, and he's just the man for the business; he knows how to manage niggers.'
               I left the ladies busily engaged in conversation about the Kuklux, the probabilities of their ridding the country of Yankees and nigger schools, and the probable length of time required for the good work, etc., and I sauntered down street for there was serious work on hand. Our press and public speakers were alive. All over the South the fire of '61 was raging anew. The same old pressure of public opinion was rapidly assuming shape, and the popular mind was being prepared for revolution with Frank Blair at the head. The Democracy was aroused. It was itself again—that noble, pure, conscientious, unterrified friend of the people and constitutional liberty—as in 1860.
               Yes, reader, the smouldering embers of the war were being rekindled. Hope loomed up in the speckled distance, and the Northern Democracy—that glorious brotherhood which organized the Knights of the Golden Circle, and came near burning Chicago—called across the lines to us, and said 'Unmask yourselves and go to work, the time has come. Victory's ours. The Radicals are divided and demoralized. We've got a Union man at the head, and a Federal General at the tail of our ticket. The soldiers of the Union army will flock to us.—Work! work!!'
               And we did. We showed to the world just what we were, and what we intended to do; we did unmask ourselves verily. We set our speakers, our dirty workers and our press at work. We abandoned universal suffrage, schools and all that. We bared our breasts to the gaze of men. We cried down with nigger suffrage and nigger domination, and carpet-bag rule. We threatened Carpet-baggers, we killed some of them, and drove others out of the country. We burnt nigger school houses, we beat and shot nigger school teachers, we got up riots and mobs, we sent the Kuklux out we held great mass meetings, we made free barbecues, to which we invited niggers, and gave them choice of seats, we drank whisky with them, we ate with them, we made them officers in our meetings, members of our clubs, sat with them in public, and paid them money for hollowing on the streets for Seymour and Blair.
               Yes, we were very busy, and worked with our sleeves rolled up. Hapsburg said we were inconsistent, that we had abandoned the platform of the National Republican party on which we stood a year ago, and were going to the devil as fast as we could. He said the Democratic party of the North had deceived us in '61, in '66, and would now do it again; he advised as all to go for Grant. But we kicked Hapsburg overboard. We wanted nothing to do with any of his kind, and had no hope but from the Democracy. They were our natural friends, believed in secession and southern rights from childhood, and we had no love for any other kind of men. Besides, Blair had promised to relieve us of nigger voting and nigger supremacy. Blair was our man for the occasion; he was a natural revolutionist. If we could elect Seymour and Blair, Brownlow's machine would soon run short of steam, and the country would be rid as if by magic of all Carpet-baggers, and native Yankees, with all their infernal arts of wickedness.
               The South go for Grant—the beast the butcher, Grant? Go, drop a match in the Atlantic and burn it up; paddle a canoe across the Rocky mountains; eat buttermilk with a knitting needle, if you choose, but don't ask us to vote for any true and genuine lover of the American Union, if you please. I walked down to McCarty's. On my way I saw a fair illustration, in a liliputian way, of the condition of the public mind which, for a more lucid portraiture of the times, I will here relate. Two little boys, of about six and nine years, had a quarrel. The older called the younger a d—d Yankee. The younger threatened to shoot—'Where'll you get a pistol?' the other asked tauntingly. 'I'll borrow Capt. Brown's.' 'He won't lend it to you.' 'Yes he will. You're a rebel and I'm a Union man, and he'll lend his pistol to a Union man any day.'
               'Good news!' said McCarty.
               'What now?' I asked.
               'The radicals are split in this congressional district; two candidates out,—Bragg and Heister. Bragg's a Carpet-bagger from Tennessee county, a clever fellow and for universal suffrage. We all know Heister. He's a native Tennesseean, but he knows that when we get to voting again, his head's cut off; so he's of the Brownlow stripe. They are both for Grant, but we must 
                     encaurage
                     encourage
                   this split; it will do us good. If Bragg's elected we gain that much; if Heister's elected then Bragg's gone up, because the radicals will never have him again, and of course we won't: that rids us of one Carpet-bagger. In either event, we get rid of a radical.'
               'But,' said I, 'if they are divided can't we put one of our own men up and defeat them both?'
               'If we do that, d—n em, they'll unite; they'll elect their man, and we are doubly beaten. But if we encourage the split, both factions will lean to us for our support, and we can act as a balance power and in part at least, control the man that is elected. Better half a loaf than no bread, Major.'
               'I see,' said I, rubbing my hands. How are our, Carpet-baggers here going?'
               'For Bragg, of course.'
               'And the niggers?'
               'They are nearly all for Heister, but they are dividing rapidly, and this too, gives us strength,' said Tom, his face smiling as a summer morning.
               'Hurrah for the split!' said I: 'Tom, let's drink to that; it's too good to be lost.' The thought of a split in the radical party was cheering.
               'Let us go to the Row,' said Tom, after we had drunk to the split.'; and we went.
               I felt happy.—I did a fact. Long looked pleased; Randolph smiled; Stout coughed and 
                     grined,
                     grinned
                   and Doubleface's eyes twinkled like forty diamonds in the moonlight. We had Champagne; we had Robertson: we had Sherry; we had lemons and sugar; and Bob,—God bless the old nigger,—was very, very busy. His face shone as a black cloud with a flood of light bursting upon it.
               That was a jolly old time—the first good news we had had since the Yankee army left. 'Day's breaking' said McCarty.
               'I'm eager for the fight,' said Randolph: 'I smell the battle afar off,' said Stout. Hurrah for the Conservative Carpet-baggers,' said Long: 'Bully for us, hip hip——' howled Doubleface as he threw his white handkerchief on the floor and spit into Randolph's hat.
               'Let's take something,' said I, agreed said all, and in an hour afterwards it would have been difficult to say whether we were six whisky casks or six casks of whisky.
               The next morning when we were somewhat over our excitement we set our wires.
               'Now,' said Doubleface, we must come the Hapsburg game over this fellow Bragg. We must tell the people to go for him strong. We may elect him. If we do, that kills Heister; if we don't, it kills him; so in either event, we get rid of one radical.' 'We must put his name on our tickets,' said Stout, and that will damn him forever with the radicals, whether we elect him or not.'
               'If we can't elect him we'll at least have the satisfaction of destroying him,' said Long. 'I'm in for using these fellows for any purpose of our own, and so managing the thing that when we are done with them nobody else will use them.
               'These kuklux are going it rather too strong,' said Doubleface. 'They are injuring us abroad. The North is going over to Grant by thousands. It is giving our thunder to the radicals, and if we don't haul in our main sail, we'll be drifted to sea.'
               'Haul her in then,' said Stout.
               'But stick to the ship,' said Long.
               'It' playing the devil with the niggers,' said Randolph. 'They have discovered that the Kuklux are men, and they shot one last night at Huller's ferry.'
               'Is that so?' said I. 'A nigger shoot a white man!'
               'Yes,' said Doubleface, 'and they'll shoot more of them, for they've found the thing out. I'll write to Gen. Bourbon at once,' and he did.
               While writing the letter, Jake Prim came in and reported that the Kuklux had made a raid into Smithville last night, destroyed a couple of nigger cabins, shot into a few more, wounding one man, and in shooting at a Carpet-bagger, missed him and killed a nigger. They made about fifty niggers promise to vote for Seymour and Blair, and notified the nigger parson to leave the country in twenty days from date. 'But,' continued he, 'the d—d niggers shot one of the boys in the leg, and came near capturing him. The niggers and Carpet-baggers made such a fuss about it that the police arrested three of the boys and have them now in custody.'
               'Let's go down,' said Doubleface; and we all started for the Recorder's office.
               'You're a d—d mean, low, thieving Yankee liar!' burst on our ears from the other side of the street, as we left the door. This proper remark was made by Dan Mumps to Jimmy Holmes, the nigger parson's boy—now grown to about nineteen. The young Yankee, without saying a word, aimed a blow at Dan's face, and the brick pavement immediately thereafter struck Dan on the back of the head. The Yank began to play with Dan's face, in a very unceremonious manner, and when pulled away by some passers by, Dan said that Yankee was a d—d fool.' But Dan did not see well; his vision was greatly obstructed by blood and brick dust. 'It's only a street fight,' said Randolph; 'let us go along.'
               We went on to the Recorder's office. There were the three boys, sons of three of our most respectable citizens. Brown and McClintock were prosecuting. They said it was a grave offence, endangering the lives of the good citizens, and could not be tolerated in a civilized community. Gen. Doubleface suggested to our worthy Recorder that this was a small matter. The boys had merely been on a little frolic, and had chosen that way to amuse themselves. 'They had always been in the habit of playing tricks when they were excited,' said he, 'and in the good old time as your honor well knows, they were permitted to commit any act that was agreeable to them on the darkeys who, of course, were not allowed to resent it, and I have no doubt that these young gentlemen, quite forgot the changed condition of the negro, and for the time thought they were living their life over again. I know they meant no harm, and they inform me that they are willing and ready to make a public apology for their conduct.'
               'That will be sufficient,' said the Recorder, and the company dispersed.
               
               The next morning a card appeared in the Reporter signed by these young gentlemen, setting forth all the facts in the case, and acknowledging they had done wrong; had merely engaged in a little sport, and would do so no more.
               But that didn't satisfy the niggers and Carpet-baggers. They wanted some 'public condemnation of the outrage,' they said. We were in a tight place. An election campaign was on our hands, and we must appease the niggers. We had a meeting. (Nobody among the whites, outside of the Row, knew anything about it, however.) The niggers came out in large numbers. We sent Highflyer, Peebles and Patterson—he that in '61 could whip a regiment of Yankees with a long sweet potato—out to the meeting to deplore the act. They made some speeches, and passed a resolution condemning the affair, and pledging everybody to assist in putting the thing down. That satisfied the niggers, and they went home contented.
               The election day came on. We expended a great deal of money for whisky, neck-ties, and gingerbread. We hired five niggers to go about the streets with Seymour badges, and hollow for Seymour and Bragg. Heister was too much for us however; he was a native Tennesseean, and could head Bragg off in profanity, drunkenness, and downright lying and blackguardism. Bragg's name on our ticket hurt him amazingly with the niggers and native Radicals. He was called a rebel by the niggers, and the Democratic ticket held in his face.
               I have said we worked very hard in that election. We did. We never showed so many faces, or resorted to so many subterfuges to carry our point. We wore a hundred coats, but all fitted us well. We were against nigger suffrage to the whites; we were for nigger officeholders with the blacks. We were everything to every man. We coaxed the niggers, we petted them, we treated them to the choicest whisky and cigars, we did everything to them and with them, except—I was going to say—sleep with them; but I am not responsible for everything our people do; I'll say nothing about the sleeping part; that's got nothing to do with elections.
               We were defeated. The Democracy of the North had deceived us again. I'm beginning to think the Democratic party's badly demoralized. We cant trust it any longer. They only make our case worse. It stands by and sees us knocked down, then it lets its rotten, stinking carcass fall on us to choke us to death. No, the Democratic party is a grand humbug—an overgrown imbecile, a stupendous cheat—a wreaking mass of rotten corruption, treachery, deceit and falsehood. May the devil take all such parties. If we had not listened to its teachings in '60 and '61, we might have had our niggers now as we once had, and not been cursed with Carpet-baggers and nigger schools.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               
                  TOOTH-POWDER—NEW LEAF IN THE DENTIST'S HISTORY—ANOTHER CARPET-BAGGER DISCOVERED—BEWILDERMENT—SOUTHERN SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION—CARPET BAGGERS ON SOUTHERN MANNERS.
               
               Our Female College was about closing its second year, and the lovers of education were to have a feast at the closing exercises and Concert Mrs. Bascom and Sue sent me down to Dr. Melville's office for some tooth powder to prepare their teeth for the college exercises. I found Mrs. Col. Stout seated in the Dentist's chair, and the Doctor examining her mouth. He recognized me at once, and I made my business known. While he turned about to get the powder for which I had called. I saw Mrs. McFlimsy coming in very hurriedly; and without appearing to notice either the Doctor or me, she went directly to Mrs. Stout, whispered something in her ear, and quickly left the office.
               Mrs. Stout raised up in the chair, and looking wonderfully surprised at the Doctor, in a tone of the utmost disgust said: 'Sir, are you a Yankee?'
               'I am from 
                     Minesota
                     Minnesota
                  , madam,' the brute answered.
               I involuntarily dropped my powder on the floor, and in the most inexpressible bewilderment, I stared at him. What! thought I: Is the country alive with Yankees? Is this deception never to cease? Am I sold again?
               But, thank the Lord, I had not yet paid for the infernal powder.
               'You can't do any work for me sir,' said Mrs. Stout, in unmistakably strong language, gathering up her bonnet, veil, parasol, handkerchief, and about forty other articles whose names I never did know. The women have such queer names for their things. We got out on the street as soon as we could. Mrs. S. was in a great hurry arranging her things. I was terribly bewildered; incomprehensibly mixed. I stopped short, and turned suddenly about, looking full in her face: 'Why, what the devil,' said I.
               
               'Hush, you old fool: let's get out o' this,' said she; and she went on up street strutting and swinging as though she were skating on rough ice with very short skates. I looked after her; then I looked up at the Dentist's sign; then up and down the street. The people were laughing at me or at some person very near me. The Dentist also, was enjoying a grin at my expense. I struck the sidewalk one good lick with my cane; gave vent to my outraged feelings in an audible—'d—n the 
                     Yaknees
                     Yankees
                  , I say;' and made my way home without delay.
               The news had preceded me. 'Take that powder right back the nasty, lying, dirty cut-throat,' said my dear, good, amiable wife. 'And here;—but no—what will I do with these teeth? they never did suit me;' and she seemed to be in a study whether to tear out her teeth or not. 'Be patient love,' said I; they're in a good place now to feel your affection for the Yankees.' She tried the strength of her grinders by repeated grittings.
               I do think Mrs. Bascom can say more without speaking, when she is on the Yankee question, than any woman I ever knew. She is much superior in this respect to Mrs. McFlimsy. Her face, on such occasions is very expressive.
               We had a great deal of trouble about that time in regard to schools. The Carpet baggers had managed to get our old school law repealed, and a new one enacted which required us to keep public schools open at least five months in each year, and permitted the district school directors to levy taxes for that purpose if the funds appropriated by the State were not sufficient. We rebelled against this law. We had no idea of paying taxes to educate niggers and other people's children. Our people wouldn't work under the law. There was only one respectable native Tenneeseean in Smithville who was in favor of it, and that man was Bob Moffat. He said our system was too costly; too aristocratic; too old fogyish, and I don't know what else. He was for doing away with old things; for getting out of the old ruts, and going on a better road.
               Yes, that man Moffat—a very sensible man too,—so thought by all of us except on this school question, was in favor of taxing the people to build school houses for niggers as well as whites. He said our education would be better, cheaper, and more in accord with the age. 'Why look at the North,' said he. 'See how they are flourishing under their free school system. Let us follow their example.' 'There,' said I. 'Moffat, that is going too far. When you want anything done here don't refer to the North in comparison: We wont stand that.'
               I talked with him; I labored with him. Long abused him; Stout sneered at him; Randolph scorned him; Doubleface made fun of him; McCarty shamed him. We all worked at him until at length he told us if we all 'wanted to go to the devil through ignorance, to go;' that he had done all he was going to do about public schools. That was just what we desired. We choked him off, and stopped his mouth. He had taken up with all the fool notions of the Carpet baggers until he was absolutely crazy, He even wanted to abolish our worshipful County Court, that ancient, venerable institution founded two centuries ago in North Carolina. Why that court is a kind of Tennessee Parliament. How could we do without it?
               I said we rebelled against the law. That's the truth: We did. Nobody would sell land for a school house to be built on: Nobody would rent buildings for school houses. We had one good public school house built before the war. It was a good large house, twenty by forty feet, and was large enough for all the poor white children in the city. We never did patronize a common school, and never intended to; and as for educating niggers, that must never be asked of the high-toned gentlemen of the South, for they have no such barbarous intentions. The thing is preposterous per se, and will not be tolerated here. The best lawyers of the State took the matter in hand. Judge Pinchbeck—a native Tennessee lawyer, had said the law was unconstitutional, and so did Gen. Highflyer, Major Peebles and others. The matter was taken into the courts. The Carpet baggers howled, and talked progress, civilization, philanthropy, duty—and all that, but our court knew its business. The law went overboard;—it was unconstitutional, and therefore void.
               Now, I don't want to be understood as saying that Tennessee is opposed to education, That is not the fact. We are simply opposed to public education. We don't want every body educated. That would ruin our social system. Why if we had such schools here as they have in Indiana, or Michigan, or any of the Northern States, in less than twenty years the boys of the farmers and laborers of the country would be taking the place of Mr. Randolph and myself. They would be wanting offices, and clerkships and other places of prominence, honor and profit. That's just what we don't want. It would ruin us. The thing wont work at all.
               We've had common schools in Tennessee for forty years. We're up with the best of the states on that. But we have two kinds of schools—one for the rich and one for the poor. The poor don't need any education. They never do any kind of business, don't take the papers have no business meddling in politics; and then they make better voters if they don't know any thing. There was the great secret of the Democratic party's success. All we have to do is to tell them who is a Democrat, and they go for him against the world, the flesh and the devil. But then, out of abundant philanthropy, we do give them a month or two schooling every few years. That's all they've ever asked, and are thankful for that. We are not troubled in Tennessee, with mechanics and day laborers in our conventions and public meetings. They leave all that to us who understand such things. How different it is in the North. No, we don't believe in all classes attending the same schools. We select our schools, our teachers and our books.
               Look at our college now. See those young ladies dressed in all the elegance of fashion, and their bright eyes sparkling like so many diamonds. Do you see any poor children there? You say Bankrupt's children are poor. I say not. Bankruptcy is misfortune; nothing more;—a quick way of paying debts you owe poor people who have spent their sweat for you. Bankruptcy is no evidence whatever of poverty. What if there are bankrupt's daughters there? They are dressed as well as the rest, and their fathers have just as much money as their neighbors. Why there is Mr. Beattie, and there is Col. Gainer, and Major Basting,—they are bankrupts, and yet they ride out every day in carriages for which they paid in the Bankrupt Court, and their wives have three servants apiece. Don't talk to me about Bankruptcy.
               I say look at those girls. They have been educated by Southern ladies, whose sympathies are all 
                     Southean
                     Southern
                  , and who teach as much as possible from Southern books. We patronize home industry in this matter of education. Our churches and sabbath schools have all discarded the old Yankee books, and now use books and papers, and employ teachers and ministers exclusively Southern. Those girls are taught just as we desire. The teachers and books are subject to our supervision. They are taught Southern ideas and Southern sympathies. We are not a sectional people by any means, but we want our children to know there is a North and a South in United States history.
               See the badges the young ladies are wearing. All indicating their training. Why during the campaign every girl in college but Hapsburg's (and she had left—) wore Seymour and Blair badges. Hear the compositions and essays. Every third one something about the South and her history—the confederate cause—the dead heroes etc. Listen to that class in Logic. Syllogism No. 1, 'All those who were in favor of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, are enemies of their country: The radical party was in favor of his impeachment: therefore the radical party are enemies of their country.' Syllogism no. 2. 'Patriots are the best of men: Southern men are patriots: therefore Southern men are the best men.'
               I give these two examples in Logic, to show first; how well our Southern girls reason; and 2d, to show how the influence of parents and teachers exhibits itself in the young mind when properly trained.
               They are southern girls, and that is a southern school. No mudsills there; no clod-hoppers' or brick-layers' daughters there. No; that school is made up of the daughters of our best people; and we don't intend that any others shall be there. That is our kind of a school. The poor people must take anything they can get, and be glad they get no worse. And I must confess that the common people among us are friendly to free schools.
               Now bear how a southern gentleman speak to those beautiful young ladies and little girls. Hon. Erastus Jones, the eagle orator of the South, was invited to deliver an educational address on the occasion. He begins: but I will quote only a few words as they were reported in our city paper.
               'Young ladies: I am proud to see that your education is so exclusively southern. I am not a sectional man and therefore do not intend to say anything disparaging to any portion of our common country. This is your native State; you must honor her. She took sides with the South in our great struggle for Southern Independence; therefore you must honor the South. That cause, for which we all fought so nobly, is not lost, and our banner is not conquered, as you hear the Yankees preach, and as, I am sorry to say, some very foolish Southern girls do sometimes sing. Those songs ought never to have been written; and if written, they never should have been sung by Southern lips; for the cause still lives in the hearts of all true patriots, and will yet assert itself; and the world will yet do reverence to the Confederate flag.
               'You should feel proud of your educational advantages, for you are under the instruction of Southern teachers who were selected because both their education and their sympathies are Southern. Your schools, and your training in them, are much better than those of the North, of which so much is said. There, the rich and the poor, the high and the low, the good and the bad, all at tend the same schools, recite to the same teachers, and from the same books. All classes of society there are mixed, and the poor have the same advantages of education that the rich enjoy, which has the effect to make all equals. Here, we select our own teachers and books. We are not troubled with county and state Superintendents intermeddling in these matters. The public school system of the North is pernicious; is a stupendous humbug, and we must have nothing to do with it. They have no well educated men up there. All great American Statesmen and Generals were from the South. Compare Grant with Lee; Sherman with Johnston. Grant is now President, although a boor. Why the best of them never get beyond a sophomoric culture.
               'Not only in matters of education, but throughout our whole social system, do we see our superiority. See our noble ladies rising in majestic grandeur as we contemplate their numberless accomplishments and virtues. If you would see the other side of the picture, look about you at the samples sent us from 
                     the the
                     the
                   North. Our manners, our customs, our institutions; all that we have and do, are better, infinitely better than theirs; and you must not read books or listen to teachers that say otherwise. You must grow up truly Southern in all your loves and sympathies, and thus perpetuate the distinguishing characteristics of your mothers."
               There now, you have an Educational Address, delivered by a Southern gentlemen to a school of Southern young ladies and little girls. It needs no embellishment or comment; therefore I will offer note but this: that is our way of teaching our daughters.
               The concert came off at night. That was a splendid occasion. I went early. The hall was large and lighted. But few, except the scholars, were there upon my arrival. The Carpet-baggers came in a body, and occupied a small space at one side by themselves. There were Hapsburg's young ones—creeping close about their mother, while other little boys of their ages were promenading the hall, arm in arm, with the little girls the same as grown people. What quiet, secluded people these Yankees are. They never left their place during the whole evening except to give way to some of our young ladies.
               The people began to come in carriages, as though it were an ancient fourth of July celebration. The beauty, modesty and intelligence of the city were there. The hall was densely crowded. The doors and windows were all full, with many still outside.
               So large and respectable an assemblage of persons on such an occasion shows our respect for education. I had but one fault to find with the proceedings. No ladies on earth know better how to behave with becoming modesty than ours. As I have before remarked, good manners is one of their chief studies. And our young ladies, paragons of excellence in this adorning art, are they. But there were so many present—so much to be said and heard—so many to be seen, so many sweet and pretty little things to be said, so many stories to tell, so many hard things to be said about the Yankees, that I can't blame them if they were a little noisy. They did make some noise it is true, indeed they were very noisy—so much so that nobody could hear what was being said or done on the stand. They talked, they laughed, they hollowed, they walked about with high heeled boots, which of course made a great stamping noise except when on some other lady's dress. If I had witnessed this scene in a Yankee school house, I should have been so disgusted that I would never have gone near one of them again; that's the plain truth. Professor North called; he beckoned; he rang the school bell; he passed among the audience, and begged them be still. Mr. Hippenhammer tried his hand, and so did Zedekiah Jones. They were laughed and talked out of countenance. They would talk, laugh, hollow, walk and chatter; and they did do it. It would have disgraced a Radical convention. I was perfectly disgusted with it. I wanted to hear my little daughter play and sing, but I might as well have been in bedlam as there.
               I saw the Yankees getting up to leave. I pitied them. Not one had spoken a word to any of them during the whole evening. They looked hurt and were going silently away. For decency's sake, I followed them and spoke to them. 'Captain, what do you think of the concert?' I asked, not knowing what else to say.
               'It would be impossible for me to pass an opinion, for I could not hear anything that was being done or said on the stand, and some young gentlemen and ladies stood up in front of us talking and laughing, shutting out both our hearing and our sight.'
               'The order is not good,' said I.
               'Major Bascom,' said Mrs. Hapsburg, 'is this a fair sample of Southern manners?'
               'Well, yes, it is,' said I, 'but, ah'—, Mrs. Bascom called me away just then, for which I have since thanked her a thousand times, and the Yankees went on their way.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               
                  ANOTHER IMPORTANT DISCOVERY—CLOUDS BREAKING—NOBLE WORK—CARPET-BAGGER AND HIGH TONED GENTLEMAN FACE TO FACE—ELOQUENCE—VICTORY.
               
               The Yankee dentist had closed his office and evacuated the city. In less than two weeks from the time his treachery was discovered, his sign no longer looked at and insulted the good people of Smithville. We offered him no violence—simply withdrew our support. That kind of treatment has proven with us a good remedy. The only satisfaction we have in his case is, that we have in the city a great deal of very good work at about half the prices we paid for similar work before and since.
               About this time we made another very important discovery. Maxwell, whom we had supposed to be a Southern man, proved to be a thorough bred Yankee from Connecticut. He resided but a few years in Missouri. This of course at once cut off all associations with his family. They had attended our church regularly, and our members visited the family. They had abundant good society, but that was to be no more. From the day their nativity was discovered, no member of the church has ever been inside of their house. He has abandoned Smithville, and set up business elsewhere, and has sent his children North to school. Another relief.
               The Smithville Mail newspaper was still published, but was doing little harm. It had no circulation except among the niggers and the few white Radicals—not over three or four hundred in all. We knew it could not live long after the public printing was taken from it which we knew would be done some day. We could only wait for that good time to be rid of that intolerably sickening nuisance. A few of us took the paper to keep ourselves, posted, and to have something to swear at.
               McClintock never did us much harm. He was more purely a business man; and while he was thoroughly a Yankee, and had all their mean habits, still he was not so dangerous away from home. Brown and Hapsburg were our most formidable enemies; they had influence both at home and abroad. We had seriously damaged Brown with the riggers, by making them believe he would swindle them out of their bounty money, but still he was very strong.
               We had the influence of these two men to destroy and then we were safe. Not a new Yankee immigrant had come into the county for two years, and we felt that we need fear no further immigration of this kind; but at least half of those who had come, were gone. This was noble work and gave us encouragement. We saw the business on which these lawyers lived was about finished. They had not collected one claim in a hundred of those filed for supplies to the armies. They had all been rejected for disloyalty of the claimants. The anticipated harvest of these nice gentlemen had failed; they reaped nothing save from the soldiers' bounty and pension claims, and they had all been made up in the first year, and nearly all been paid. They never had any business in our courts, except for the first year or two;—the niggers employed them in criminal cases for which they neither asked nor received pay. But the niggers soon learned if they didn't want to go to the penitentiary, they must employ us. Our juries thought it was safest always to find against anybody who employed a Carpet bag lawyer. Thus, it was evident our Yankee luminaries were in their last phases. They must make some favorable change, or they were starved out, so far as law business was concerned. An opportunity of this kind offered, and they fought for it desperately. Another election was to be held; a high and responsible office was to be filled—that of Chancellor. All lawyers understand this term. The most important law suits in Tennessee are heard and determined in the Chancery Court. Our Chancery Division is composed of eleven counties; the courts held twice a year. Pinchbeck and Hapsburg were rivals for the nomination of the Radicals. The niggers were opposed to Pinchbeck; they knew his record, and would have nothing to do with him. He was defeated before the convention, and immediately thereafter demanded a return of the two hundred dollars he had given to the Smithville Mail.
               Hapsburg then had the Radical field to himself. There were six aspirants on our side for the vacant Chancellorship. But we didn't propose to be defeated by our own division; so we held a convention and placed Major Peebles on the track. Major Peebles was a man of experience and great law learning. He was a native Tennesseean. We all knew him; he was just fifty-eight years of age—a christian all his life and highly respected by all. He never was known to advocate anything which the community disapproved; indeed I am not certain that he was ever known to advocate anything, and hence we had entire confidence that with him on the bench, we need fear no innovations either in the order or the practice of the court. No improper agitations would be permitted when he presided. In short, Major Peebles was a thorough bred, high toned Southern gentleman.
               Of Hapsburg, the reader has a correct appreciation now. The truth is he was a man to be feared in Tennessee. He was quiet, unobtrusive, and modest in his manner—rarely ever left his office—never long, and was always ready for any business which might fall at his door, and with all his low-flung meanness, was a good lawyer. But his whole being was alive with the destructive notions of Yankeeism. He advocated 'reform,' as he called it, everywhere. He said we needed many better things. He was in favor of abolishing our County Court; he said our road system was miserable—the roads were not quarter worked, and then the poor man had as much of this to do as the rich man. He insisted on taxation for school-houses and tuition. I say he was a man to be feared in Tennessee, for he was a genuine revolutionist, but not of the Frank Blair stripe, and we determined to destroy him at all hazards.
               But it was the most difficult work we ever encountered. The niggers were wild for him; they discovered in spite of our warfare against him he was consistent. Many of the poor whites—the mechanics, small farmers and laborers, were for him. This class said 'Hapsburg is a poor man; he is not ashamed of work, and always recognizes a laboring man whether white or black, wherever he meets him, and he would give our children an equal chance in life with the rich man's child.'
               But this was all before the canvass opened. Not long afterward, I assure you.
               We determined, I say, to destroy him no matter at what risk. We held a caucus, and pledged ourselves each and every one, to do any work and furnish any amount of money which should be required for this purpose. The resolution was a solemn one, and made with a perfect understanding of all the surroundings. We firmly determined that Charles Hapsburg should never disgrace the bench of Tennessee. Even if the votes on count should show his election, he should never receive a commission, or if he did, he should never hold a court. I repeat, this was a solemn and determined resolution. We would beat him in the election if we could, but we would beat him. That fact was fixed, and we worked with that object in view. We organized as we had never been organized since the war. We brought out every available man in the eleven counties and set him at work. We selected our men for special duty—each for that particular kind of work for which he was best adapted. We chose Doubleface for the general engineering; Randolph to do the heavy work, where dignity was required; (but we needed little of that.) Zedekiah Jones was to do the meanest lying, and Jake Prim the swearing. These were the chiefs or heads of the different departments of our grand work. Then, if any legal argument was to be made, Col. Long was to take charge of that. Long never could wear but one face; he was the same consistent, fearless, violent, impassioned hater of Yankees all the time. Hapsburg at first took his horse and passed quietly among the people for several weeks. But our leaven was in his wake and poisoned all his hopes. In his absence, we set our newspaper men at work as oilers of the magnificent mechanism we had in motion. From six to ten paragraphs were weekly spread before the reader's eyes in the Smithville Reporter, charging him with all manner of meanness, treachery and crime; and we sent our young lawyers out to read these things to that portion of our people who cannot read. We charged, him with having some great plot secretly in view, to destroy our citizens, their honor and their property. We charged him with double dealing, with having, as a Union soldier, arrested and made money out of our citizens; with having been bribed as an officer of the Federal army; with being a spy and traitor. But specially, (and here was our strong hold with the whites) did we charge him with associating with niggers, and being in favor of nigger equality, nigger jurors, nigger officers, etc. The Reporter was alive with excoriating abuse. The speakers, and every lawyer in Smithville, except stout and Moffat, were in the field—distributing and reading circulars containing these charges, among the people, and they devoted a great deal of their time to the rehearsals of these damaging statements.
               Our combined effort in the different counties settled the matter so far as the white vote was concerned. Many of the white Radicals—I may say all the native ones—needed but little convincing. They don't like Carpet baggers much better than we; they are jealous of them, and they did not work hard against us. If they did not vote with us, they at most did not vote largely against us. This was a good lever for us, but we had to use it privately. In this canvass, every individual white man in the eleven counties was seen personally and ordered, yes ordered, to poll the votes of his vicinity, white and black, and poll them right. Now for the nigger vote.
               Hapsburg saw the work we had done and were still doing. He then threw off all reserve and unmasked himself. He was a changed man. He made a speech to about a thousand niggers, and it set them wild. The fire spread from county to county, until every nigger in the district was at his fighting weight. We had our spies out at his meetings; but he said nothing that was not true. He spoke kindly of Peebles, but in caustic terms of us. We had dreaded the Brownlow campaign, but this exceeded it in public excitement. That one speech had kindled a flame that we had to quench.
               Now Hapsburg was poor. He had no money. The district was a hundred and fifty miles in diameter. He could not afford to pay nigger canvassers. He had but one true white friend who rendered him any available service, and that friend was Brown. McClintock worked hard at home, and so did Coole and Holmes, but they never went out of their own county. We had eighty-four available lawyers, and all the money we needed. Our first effort was to circulate in circulars certain charges which we said Hapsburg had made against our people. We didn't sign the circular, but the canvassers indorsed it. This inflamed and fretted the public mind terribly. The people hated him bitterly, and it would have been an easy matter to have had him waylaid at any time. That put the country people at work on the niggers. In this way we made it unsafe for him to travel by night, or speak to nigger assemblies, except in the county towns. He dared not visit country places at all. Then we made free barbecues all through the district, and invited the niggers to attend. But this did not work satisfactorily. They doubted the sincerity of our intentions, and would not come to our meetings, we were compelled to send our canvassers to their fields and cabins to talk with them there. We bought up half a dozen niggers and sent them out to work for us, but they soon returned and reported that it was not safe for them to be out, for the other niggers would kill them.
               The last resort was then reached. We threatened. We declared—that is every employer of niggers declared—that eternal disgrace, destitution and loss of employment, if even it stopped there—would follow the tracks of every nigger who voted for Hapsburg. This had a better effect, for the white radicals were so few, and those confined to the towns—that they had little practical power against such odds. We had forty canvassers to their one. And when we made public speeches we did it in such places, and at such times as rendered it impossible for Hapsburg to be present then or before the election.
               He had some nigger canvassers out, but we soon put an end to that. We shot one or two of them, and the thing ended suddenly. We believe! we had destroyed his courage and challenged him to meet Peebles at Calhoun a few days before the election. We expected he would refuse, but he did not; and the discussion took place. We were not well satisfied with this, and would have been glad it had rained, or snowed, or anything else to prevent the meeting, for we doubted the ability of Peebles to hold his own with so unprincipled an opponent. But it did not rain; neither did it snow: A beautiful moonlight night gave perfect freedom for all to attend; and the crowd was very large. Our heaviest men were present;—Randolph, Highflyer, Long, and several hundred others. The niggers came in crowds. Our meeting was held in a grove, and torches lit the scene.
               All this may be 
                     unintersting
                     uninteresting
                   to my readers; but it shows the Carpet-bagger; and that is all this book is written for. We will now, for the first time, see a high-toned gentleman of the South, and a contemptuous, low-flung Yankee, face to face before the people; and if the reader is not disgusted by the comparison, I can only say that I have drawn it accurately, and my part is done.
               "My fellow 
                     coutrymen
                     countrymen
                  :" began Peebles. "I am before you a candidate for a very honorable office. I need say but little to you about myself. I was born in your midst, and have grown bald in the county of Middlebury. You all know me and my history. You know that I never betrayed our people; therefore your laws and customs are safe in my hands. And you, my colored friends, what shall I say to you? My heart swells with the kindliest affection for you and your offspring; and I am at a loss to find words to express my admiration of your people. As the inspired Poet has so 
                     sweety
                     sweetly
                   said: 
                     "I only know that I love you."
                  
               
               I have always been your friend, and if you elect me Chancellor, I shall remember you if possible, with still greater affection. I am now, as in the past, in favor of your education, and I am for your friend Stokes for Governor. I don't want your money, I don't want your liberties; I only want your votes. I am a native of Tennessee. We are all southern men together; we were born on the same soil; were raised together; and our interests are all the same; therefore we ought to stand by each other in these trying times, and not go out of our own State for men to fill the offices. You all want a man that you know; a man that was raised right here—that never betrayed you, 
                     so so
                     so
                   you'll know where to find him. (We all knows whar to find you;) bawled out a nigger the crowd.
               'Now look at this fellow here—this mean, low Carpet-bagger—this cunning cheat and swindler—this 'man Hapsburg. See how cool and crafty he looks. [And here the speaker turned full upon the scoundrel.] See the deliberate, devilish, plotting in his immovable features. Do you want, such a man as this for your Chancellor? ['Yes,' cried several hundred niggers] What do you know, about him or his history? Does any of you know where he came from, or where he was born? Did you ever see his daddy, or his mammy? Do you know how long it is since he was in some penitentiary in the North? [Cheers from the whites.] Good men from the North don't leave their homes and come South. It is only scoundrels, the convicts, the cut-throats and plunderers like this fellow, that come down here to curse the country. They come to steal your money and mine. All this man Hapsburg wants is to fleece you; he wants to run his long hands down into your pockets and filch your hard earnings: [Cheers from the whites.] He don't care anything about you; he would sell you gain into slavery if he could make five cents by it. Money, money, money, is all he's after. He pinches a dime so hard that he makes the eagle on it squeal. He wants to steal and get rich off you and me. That's the kind of man he is. [Prolonged cheering from the whites.] The Major here began to grow eloquent. He came from the frosty regions of the North where they have to pry the snow up with a crowbar; up there where the icebergs are as thick and large as the rocks on the Cumberland mountains. He came from a cool country and that's what makes him so cool here. I warn you against such a man; he is dangerous in any community where the 
                     peo-
                     people
                   don't know him; he will rob you if you give him an opportunity. Vote for me, a man you know and can trust, and then you are safe. I won't drag the ermine down into the and mire of politics. I leave that for dirty workers to do. Cast this cool, cunning, calculating, swindling Carpet-bagger overboard, and let him go back to his mammy among the snowy hills of the North where he came from.' [Loud and prolonged cheering.]
               Major Peebles continued in this elegant and dignified strain for an hour or more, and took his seat perfectly exhausted. Mr. Jamison reported the whole speech, but it is not necessary to quote it all here, as this paragraph is a fair sample of the whole of that able argument. I expected to see Hapsburg wince under the terrible flaying; but stupid, shameless fool, he only exhibited occasional signs of disgust. All the Major's friends congratulated him on the good effect of his speech, and the unanimous opinion was that it was the happiest effort of his life. The Major felt that he had made a masterly effort for he never looked better pleased although he was worn out.
               Hapsburg rose. It was very plain that his nigger friends were a good deal shaken in their faith for they were perfectly silent. That gave us hope. He looked slowly round over the vast audience for some seconds, apparently filing his rotten lungs with our pure air,—and began thus:
               'I have fruitlessly hoped that this canvass would be conducted upon high principles of decorum, and that the opposing candidates would not feel called upon to depart from the usual proprieties of public discussion. I have been pained to learn to night for the first time, that there are no issues between us except 1st, whether I am a gentleman; and 2d, whether I was born in this chancery division. The schooling of my boyhood, and the instincts, as well as practice of my manhood, quite unfit me for service in any controversy where nothing is at stake but personal character. Of my distinguished competitor I have but a word to say. I look upon him as an accomplished christian gentleman, and were my opinion of him different, it would be foreign to my education to express it. In reply to his personal charges, I prefer to be silent. As to my birthplace;—when memory runs back over the past, and all its wonderful history comes up in review, I cannot but say, I am proud of the home of my childhood.
               'But,'—(and here his face began to brighten)—'there is more than merely two men in this struggle. Why all this excitement, this vituperation, slander and falsehood? Why this profuse expenditure of time, brains, and money? Why this army of canvassers in opposition to one poor man? Why so fierce a struggle? Am I dangerous? am I an incendiary? Ah! there is the secret of it all. I preach a revolutionary doctrine—a heresy. I would destroy the unserviceable wreck of past systems, and on the ruins build a new and better temple. I would destroy that ancient system which pampers the rich while it grinds the poor; that system which digs a gulf between the classes and holds the poor little orphan at bay.
               'Life is unequal here. A line is drawn between the high and the low. While the son of the mechanic or day laborer shivers in the cold, the child of luxury passes gleefully on his way. Magnificent structures are erected for the education of the planter's son, while the poor boy cannot read his name. This is all wrong. Build in every neighborhood a school; start afresh the fountains of learning; and bid the people come. Raise, educate, cherish the poor."
               He continued in that strain for a time, and then broke out thus:
               "And to the colored men present, I have this to say. The men who now claim your votes as of right, belong to a party whose enmity to the negro is patent to the world. (Cheers from the niggers.) As between my honorable competitor and myself, there is nothing. I only hold up to view the record of his party whose friendship is evidenced by two centuries of bondage. Every act tending toward your improvement has been uniformly opposed by it. Its history is one of treachery and wrong."
               He then went into a review of political history, which was very dull to Democratic ears, and I will not quote it. I will just say, by way of showing his excessive stupidity, that he stated in broad terms that the Democratic party had no personal respect for the negro.
               There you have the two men. One is refined, able, argumentative, courteous, elegant; the other vulgar, ignorant, brutish. Compare them at your leisure, reader.
               On election day we put our shoulder to the wheel. We spent money in places where the niggers were not afraid to come out. In most places we had them so much bewildered and frightened that they did not vote at all. In Smithville they appeared very numerously. We had our saloons in good order. We did what we had never done before. Every lawyer in the Row, (except Long and Moffat) and our principal merchants, mingled freely with the 'colored friends,' as we then called them. We took them into the saloons, drank with them, gave them ginger bread, peanuts, candies, neckties, handkerchiefs, gloves, and everything that would entice them away from Hapsburg, and then walked up with them to the polls to vote. This we kept up till night. Peebles supplied himself with two good small shooting irons, and made free to attack any and every Carpet-bagger he chanced to meet. They worked, but only at and about the polls; they neither drank whisky themselves nor gave it to the niggers. We made several efforts to create a riot; we insulted Brown, McClintock, Holmes and Coole—all of them; but they said the election must go on decently so far as they were concerned, and they wouldn't resent anything we said. Hapsburg took no part whatever. In this respect our candidate showed himself in his true colors. He went rapidly from place to place canvassing, threatening niggers and Yankees, and made himself so conspicuous and obnoxious, that he might have been injured by the niggers, had not his friends asked him to go away.
               The polls were closed. We had gained the day. Two hundred and fifty majority for Peebles. Hurrah for Peebles! But his election cost us a great deal of money, and more dignity and self-respect.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               
                  DEATH TO CARPET-BAGGERS—BRIGHT DAYS COMING—MUST HAVE A FIGHT—McCARTY TRIUMPHANT.
               
               It was finished. The work was done Carpet-baggers were now powerless in Smithville. We had control of every thing. We had learned the art of managing nigger voters. We rejoiced with exceeding great joy. We congratulated each other, and swore vengeance on the Yankees. We talked it freely on the streets and in the stores,—at home—everywhere. Our next effort would be to drive them out of the country. We took special pains to insult them everywhere, and on all occasions. We sneered at them, we scorned them, we turned away when they passed, and stepped across the street when they were coming toward us. The Smithville Reporter kept up the fire for several weeks after the election, and until we discovered signs of yielding. To quote the last paragraph of the paper: 'The Carpet-baggers are squirming terribly; they begin to feel the pressure.' Indeed our threats were so frequent and public, that the niggers stood guard in the night time for a week round Hapsburg's house.
               They offered no resentment however, in any manner. The Smithville Mail did not even publish one unkind word about us either before or after the election. This contemptuous treatment on their part aroused our indignation still more, and we determined to bring the matter to an issue. Some twenty-five of us collected at McCarty's, and prepared for our work. Coole and McClintock had to pass that way to their offices. We selected McCarty to make the attack. We armed him with a cudgel and revolver. Coole came leisurely and smilingly along and turned into Bombast's store to purchase a hat. As he came out, McCarty attacked him on the street. He struck him one blow, and spit in his face, saying he was going to drive the d—d Yankees out of the place, and had the whole town to back him. Coole said he was unarmed, was not a fighting ing man, and asked us to take McCarty away. But we didn't do anything of the kind. He made no resistance whatever, but walked sneakingly away to his office. That was not what the thing was started for. Then came McClintock. McCarty attacked him in the same way. But he wouldn't fight. What could we do under such provoking circumstances? We must have a fight; we must kill at least one Yankee while our blood was up.
               The niggers began to look around the corners. Perhaps we would have a row yet. Who knows? But nothing more that day. The Carpet-baggers all went home by back ways.
               At night we collected our arms at McCarty's, and sent about forty men out to reconnoiter; but they only found some niggers scattered about in the vicinity of the Carpet-baggers' houses.
               Then we consulted, for a Gubernatorial election was at hand; and the radicals were divided into two factious. We must give aid, and comfort to that war; for in it is the restoration of Tennessee: and hence we concluded not to kill any Yankees just then. We would simply hate them; hate them with all the power God had given us; and keep up an incessant storm of public indignation whose merciless power they should at all times feel without any means of escape except to leave the country.
               Aye, we left them to feel the heat of our unutterable contempt. When they passed, we turned our backs on them; we used every means short of personal violence; and we succeeded admirably. We soon drove them off the streets. A few of our people objected to this course; but they were too few to notice, and were confined to the Moffatt school and the young lawyers who never entered heartily in the work, and who would not care if a thousand Yankees settled in Smithville tomorrow. But WE rule this country; and what opposes US goes down. Yes, we drove them from the streets and the churches; their pews were vacated; and we did not inquire the cause. Hapsburg took down his sign and closed his office. His name was made a byword and a scandal in the country. We would not even employ a nigger who had worked for him.
               One morning, as I passed near the Postoffice, thinking over the good, christian work we were doing. I observed a paper lying on the sidewalk. On opening it, I saw it was in the handwriting of Hapsburg. I took it to McCarty's, where that pious man read it to some twenty-five of our most respectable citizens. It was as follows:
               
                  Lines Written on Taking Down My Sign.
                  
                     'Twas four years ago, when my hopes were as bright
                     As the day dawn of childhood's most innocent night;
                     When fresh from the battlefield's carnage and spoil,—
                     Fatigued with the wearisome burden and toil
                     Of a triplet of years in my country's employ,—
                     That I drank in the sunshine of peace with its joy,
                     And hanged at my door this symbol of trade
                     To show to the passer what choice I had made
                     Of business in life,—what path I would tread
                     To earn for my family honor and bread.
                  
                  
                     The people received me then kindly enough;
                     The paper that's published here gave me a puff;
                     And many the reasons I had to believe
                     Their welcoming words were not used to deceive.
                     No malice I bore to the people in truth;
                     My mother had taught me good manners in youth;
                     And what in good feeling and kindness they said,
                     Was heard in my heart and with kindness repaid.
                  
                  
                     Life opened upon me most beautiful then;
                     In brilliant perspective I looked upon men
                     Whose history taught me reliance and hope;—
                     My prospect was pleasant and widened in scope.
                     'Neath Tennessee's balmy, salubrious sky
                     'Twere pleasant to live, and 'twere pleasant to die.
                     My fortune was wrecked and my health was impaired;
                     New home 'mid new scenes I'd selected, and dared
                     To make me new friends on my enemy's field
                     By shaking his hand and respecting his shield.
                  
                  
                     But "time worketh wonders," hath truly been said:
                     We think we are living and yet we are dead.
                     A poison it seems is in every cup,
                     From which in mistaken reliance we sup;
                     And when we are dreaming of pleasure in store,
                     Its virus is oozing from every pore.
                     And so it hath proven with me, and with thee,
                     Inanimate symbol. Our hopes, as we see,
                     Are blighted and scattered in four short years;—
                     Began them in gladness,—we end them in tears.
                  
                  
                     How often with pride I have listened and heard
                     Thy innocent creaking as song of a bird
                     That watchers would stare at, then catch up its tune
                     To cheer on their courage or drive away gloom.
                  
                  
                  
                     How many have seen thee,—thou guard at my door,
                     Like angel at night to watch o'er the poor,—
                     And came with their smiles and encouraging looks
                     To cheer the lone inmate who sat at his books?
                     Not many, not many: Alas! they were few;—
                     Not three;—I repeat it now only to you.
                     How many have seen thee and passed with a grin
                     The door that would gladly have welcomed them in?
                     How many have passed thee contemptuously by
                     And heard not the sorrowful moan or the sigh
                     Escaping the lips, with a pitiful pride,
                     Of the lonely and cheerless attorney inside?
                     How many have seen thee thy owner to hate?
                     How many have cursed thee both early and late?
                     How many, (ashamed of the name thou dost wear,)—
                     Afraid of their masters,—came in at the rear?
                     Ah, yes; there were hundreds of these I could name
                     T' their lasting dishonor and permanent shame.
                  
                  
                     No clients came near us to offer us fees;
                     No friends to advise us; no one could we please;
                     We've quietly gone on our pitiless way
                     Inviting employment, and justice as pay;
                     But met disappointment, derision, contempt,
                     Contumely, hatred, at every attempt.
                     By scorn and by hate, by sneers and neglect,
                     They've taught us to know that their early respect
                     Was a cheat and a swindle,—just meant to allay
                     Suspicion and doubt till they'd drive us away.
                  
                  
                     Their work is completed, companion and friend;
                     We're daily approaching our sorrowful end.
                     The music thy swinging has made to my ears
                     For many an hour these wearisome years,
                     As whispering breezes came silently by
                     To fan thee and soothe thee, then pass with a sigh,
                     No more must be heard: 'Tis insulting to some
                     Who bade us, when danger was near them, to come.
                     The shaft upon which so long thou hast hung,
                     And songs, to my memory so sacred, hast sung,
                     I pry from its fastenings over the door
                     And lay thee away. Thou'lt disgust them no more.
                  
                  
                     We've tried to be friendly, we've tried to do right;
                     We've tried to be decent in every one's sight;
                     We've done our whole duty,—we've naught to regret;
                     But decency here has never been yet
                  
                  
                     A passport to honor, except he who wears
                     This badge of good breeding most solemnly swears
                     Allegiance to all that the masters dictate,
                     And then he's prescribed with a terrible hate
                     Unless 'twas his lot to be born on this side
                     That beautiful river whose waters divide
                     The sections of one common country in two
                     Where all of the people should brothers be true.
                  
                  
                     But now that we leave them thus scorned and despised,
                     For nought that we've done them or even advised,
                     In sorrow I tell thee, if thus it must end,
                     In spite of their enmity I am their friend.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               
                  SAFE—SENTER AND STOKES—TENNESSEE METHOD OF CANVASSING—GOOD TIMES—GREAT JOY—HOW THE THING WAS DONE—DEFINITION OF A CARPET-BAGGER.
               
               We are safe now. The clouds break, and sunshine appears upon every edge. We're not in this fight; we are merely happy lookers on, clapping our hands and shouting hazzahs at every blow either of the candidates deals the other. We care not who succeeds, Senter or Stokes, we win in any event. The revolution is under way, and has gone too far to stop short of universal enfranchisement of all white men.
               The candidates are both native Tennesseeans. They understand our warfare on the hustings. They are personal, bitter, implacable. Read their speeches;—no argument, reason, or principle, all vituperation abuse, and scandal. The only object in view is, for each to show to the people how mean a man the other is. That is our tactics in Tennessee. It always wins on one side or the other; generally the better man is defeated. (When you want to break a man down, abuse him.) I am here merely repeating my thoughts which occured during the Senter-Stokes canvass. We had no doubt whatever of the result; but we cared little for that; for the Governor in our state has no vote power. Our (rebel) vote was so large as to be in demand. We had cut down the radical majority nearly thirty thousand in little more than a year, and it was not quite certain whether in this election the state could be carried by either candidate without our help. Therefore we knew we could control the Legislature and that was all we cared a button about.
               To show how neatly we did our work, I will relate the modus operandi in our own county, which is a fair sample of what was done in every county in the state where anything of the kind was needed.
               I have already informed the reader that Captain Coole was our Commissioner missioner of Registration. We got up a petition to the governor, setting forth that Coole was grossly and wilfully violating the law; that he was guilty of inexcusable frauds; that he was a stranger to our people, and therefore could not know properly who was, and who was not entitled to vote; that he refused certificates of registration to many persons plainly entitled to them, and gave to hundreds not entitled; that he refused to open his office for the accommodation of the people; that he was utterly unfit for the position he held: that all we asked was, a fair and honest administration of the law; that we wanted to obey the laws of the land, and did not think it right to have such a man in so important a position, etc., This petition was circulated and at least two thousand names signed to it. It was forwarded to the Governor, who, when he saw such grave charges sustained by two thousand people in our county, at once removed Coole, and appointed one of our native Union men in his stead.
               Things changed. We saved the Commissioner much trouble by at least one hundred of us acting as his deputies. We sent active young men out into the country to collect the names of the people. We made out certificates for all of them, handed them over to the Commissioner who signed them without asking any questions. He knew we would not deceive him, and therefore he saved time by simply writing his name under what we had written. This was right, and according to law. Mr. McGruder deserves great credit for his kindness in this matter. Instead of nine hundred voters which we had when Coole was removed, in less than a week the white voters of Middlebury County numbered thirty-five hundred—at least eight hundred more than we had in 1860. The fact is, we thought we ought to vote, and we did vote. Nearly every confederate soldier in the county voted. That, now, is law and order.
               We promised in the beginning not to place any candidates in the field, and on said promise, Senter stock ran up to a high premium. Moderate Republicans, as they called themselves;—that is Universal Suffrage Republicans—(just what we had been in 1867)—and every Carpet-bagger in the state, were for Universal Suffrage; gave all their influence to a liberal administration of the franchise law. They made no objections to our getting the Commissioners removed. The native radicals were all Stokes men, and Senter was under no obligations to them. With the help of the Carpet-baggers, who thought we were fully in earnest for once in the right path, we soon had the machine working magnificently.
               We made all proper arrangements to support none but Senter republican candidates. About two weeks before the election, when everything was in our own hands, we called conventions all over the State, and placed our men on the track. Oh! what a splendid maneuver; what magnificent strategy! Poor Moderate Republicans! Silly Conservatives! Crazy Reformers! Stupid, oily Carpet-baggers! How beautifully we sold you; how cheaply we bought you. We patted you on the cheek, while we introduced our steel to your hearts.
               Tennessee is free. Every man in the State who wants to vote, has the papers in his pocket. Nigger rule is ended; Carpet-bag domination is destroyed forever. Our Legislature is right; not a radical in it. Behold the noble work it is doing. It repeals the Franchise law, the Militia, the school, the Advertising law; suspends the Public Printer, etc. But why enumerate? for the work is done. Carpet-baggers are bunting other homes, sacrificing their property here, and already beginning their exodus. Radical newspapers are growing beautifully less, and Scallawags have turned reformers, by leaving the country for its good. We, the people, are laughing in our sleeves at the stupidity of the whole tribe of political scavengers; and we go abroad shouting "Te Deum laudamus."
               We intend to restore our noble State to her pristine greatness; we'll wipe out the legislation of the past four years; we'll have a Constitutional Convention to oust the present radical office holders; and then, we'll be ourselves again, redeemed and disenthralled. We'll preach public education, while we repeal the Common School law; we'll cry Honor and public Faith, while we repudiate part of the State debt; we'll invite immigration, while we destroy the State Board, drive out every Carpet-bagger, and make him hate us with such intensity that he'll tell all his friends to stay away. If we cannot have a separate government, we can live a separate people.
               Now, reader, you have read this book; and I think you will fully agree with me, that while personally the Carpet-bagger is all that the Hon. Mr. Jones described him to be, yet of him morally, something more may properly be added. I therefore venture the further thought that—
               The Carpet-bagger is a man in the South who was born north of the Ohio river, who has imbibed the social and political theories of the Northern people—no matter what he calls his politics,—and who, when he comes, says what he thinks.
            
         
      
      
         
            ERRATA.
            The last sentence on the 15th page should read thus:
            "I determined to submit the case to my friends when they returned from the South, which I confidently expected would be in a few days."
         
         
            THE GREAT AMERICAN POEM MYRIORAMA,
            BY W. A. PEFFER.
            This splendid work of genius, written in the most elevated style of Blank Verse, is, as it is intended to be, a Poetic View of American History. Opening at Cromwell's time, it traces our unwritten history down to the election of General Grant, which is described in language and imagery that none but Poets use.
            The work is peculiar, and covers a new field. Its great value consists in its demonstrative and representative character. The brilliant personifications impress the mind of the reader as though he were witnessing a delightful drama. For this reason every young American should own and study Myriorama.
            We have received many flattering notices from the Press; but we prefer to insert a few brief extracts from the work itself.
            Our early 
                  hisory
                  history
               : 
                  
                     The day on which
                     The youthful nation moved within the womb
                     Of time in warning of its future birth!
                     When love of freedom and the right
                     Drove sides of men from eastern shores
                     And wafted them to this.
                  
               
            
            Of our Banner: 
                  
                     To shaft of glittering spear, this flag
                     Was hung, and in the talons tightly clasped
                     Of bold majestic eagle from the mountain cliff
                     With shield of bristling arrows plumed,
                     They placed the spear and bade the noble bird
                     Convey it to the earth and let the people see it.
                  
               
            
            Birth of the Union: 
                  
                     His hand outstretching, Justice
                     Blessed the boy, while Liberty, with
                     Virtue at her side and Independence.
                     Stood, and took baptismal vows.
                  
               
            
            The Union soldier: 
                  
                     A soldier's heart has feeling left. His eye
                     Within its steady light, holds still a tear.
                  
               
            
            Of the late Rebels: 
                  
                     It is better far for us and them
                     To make ourselves secure, then draw a line
                     Across the face of all those dreadful years.
                  
               
            
            In the Conclusion, of Freedom: 
                  
                     If freedom's not a farce and liberty,
                     A dream.—then where our banner floats let all
                     Be free;—the hand, the thought, the pen,
                     None fearing danger from his fellow man—
                     The midnight raider's devilish mask.
                     His fiendish threat or his avenging steel;
                     Nor yet the shafts of malice born of hate
                     Long nurtured, nor the odium of public scorn
                     Piled mountain high to stand where bayonets failed,
                     As barriers against the march of mind. When such
                     A state exists, then, in the footprints of the dead
                     Who died the heroes of a wicked cause.
                     We'll write an epitaph upon the past.
                     Forgiving all its wrong, its crime, its blood,
                     And sing with truth We're free;—ALL free
