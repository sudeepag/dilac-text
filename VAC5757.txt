            ORIGINAL NOTICE.
            I AM an Old Bachelor. I am forty-four years old. Forty of those years I
               have lived the life of the happy Bachelor, not getting caught either in Matrimony or
               in Literature. As to the first, I shall probably always be safe:—but, in regard to
               the last, the little volume which accompanies this preface shows that I have
               surrendered to its potent, most fascinating charms. For forty years I remained a
               freeman, joyous and light-hearted, master of my own will and actions, successfully
               resisting the seductive allurements of the persuasive, insinuating Muse to write and
               publish; never betraying myself except in an occasional fugitive piece for the
               country paper:—but alas! at the end of that time the unguarded moment came, as it so
               often does to even the most watchful, when the charming witch pressed her suit so
               eloquently and seductively, that, perforce, I surrendered. The jade, who
               has been so often extemporized as coy—but she was not so with me, as you
               have already suspected—triumphed. I now follow in her train, though unwillingly, a
               votary. Yes, for two years past I have been, like all who write from
                  Inspiration, a Slave of the Pen;—a Slave; whether my
               Genius mate with some ancient Grecian or with some lesser Fame, still a slave; my
               chiefest consolation, aside from a hope for fame, being the agreeable knowledge that
               there are a few choice souls who are similarly wearing out their years of bondage in
               the same state of exalted isolation from among their fellow-men.
            
            But, as I have intimated, don't imagine that, if I have been seduced and have
               surrendered, I wear the shackles tamely, for I do not, though the bondage is, in many
               senses, most soothingly agreeable. I do sometimes try, for a season, to break away
               from my thralldom; but it does no good. I may plunge deep into politics, theology,
               the sciences—may mingle with dozens or with multitudes of men to reason and to
               dispute;—I may throw down my pen and rush out into the fields and forests and there
               roam and race about for a whole day, for a week, a month, six months, in the vain
               endeavor to escape my fate or my genius. Such endeavors are vain: they
               never avail me anything. I know I experience the thought at such times, and know that
               I shall finally surely return, as I invariably do, seize my torturing, but yet most
               beloved pen, and commence to write in a fury of desperation in order to relieve
               myself.
            According to a canon in Literature, and according as some of the wicked ones
               maliciously say, these signs indicate Genius. That canon is correctly
               laid down, and the wicked ones, however ironically they may speak, are right. It is
               Genius—a Genius, whether its mate be the great Grecian or some lesser Fame, awakened
               and clamoring that an appreciative audience be procured it;—a genius that I believe
               will be of value to the world, but which, nevertheless, for the sake of rest to
               myself I wish I could quell. I wish I could subdue it and make myself its master,
               because, while my mind, this Genius, is courting action, labor, my temperament
               invites to repose. At the same time that I am daring and demanding the
               world to recognize my Royalty of Thought, I can heartily say: girl-fashion though it
               be:—
            "I wish the 'spirit' that causes those aforementioned signs would go
               away and leave me in peace and not tease me so. I'm tired and want to rest a
               spell."
            The particular manner in which my enthrallment came about was in this wise:—
            Strolling along over the smiling meadows that embrace the clinking Ganargua—a sweet
               little stream winding its way among banks of verdure across my native town—strolling
               along those fair banks in company with a couple of friends one pleasant May day some
               two years or so ago, in pursuit of the gentle Izaak's pastime, they saw fit to offer
               some pleasant banter with regard to my well known Literary predilections. I do not
               choose to say what cause originated the conversation, but that, for some reason—some
               reason sufficient to themselves I suppose—they pleasantly chaffed me in regard to my
               humble efforts in the local papers.
            The nature of their talk was such that it caused me to assure them, in reply, and in
               defense of myself and my young "bantlings," that I believed I could
               write as good bits of romance and of sentiment as are produced to order by the
               accomplished lady writers of the Magazines. "Just like a sentimental, dreaming,
                  nonsensical woman," I suppose the frozen-hearted will say, I believed I
               could appreciate the utmost pathos or exaltation of sentiment as it finds its place,
               and lives in the congenial heart, and could unfold my thoughts in as good style as
               can those women of large, lovely souls.
            Well, my friends being of the class of men who think that the male heart has not the
               capabilities to experience love in as exalted a degree as has the female, and
               therefore cannot, of course, explain as completely that which it cannot comprehend;
               or, if believing, judging that shame, intellectual incapacity, or some inefficiency
               of some sort, would prevent the man from revealing his soul to the world, as he must
               to some extent if he undertake to deal faithfully with matters pertaining to the
               affections, rashly challenged me to the trial. I say rashly, because I
               know they thought that, like them, I also was bantering and would not for that, as
               well as for the other reasons given, and still others not given, attempt to vindicate
               my words with deeds.
            
            But I accepted the gage so inconsiderately thrown to me. And having accepted I went
               to work in the course of the next six months, resolved to do something. Calling to my
               assistance my knowledge of some very interesting circumstances in the lives of a
                  Family named Dimond, and visiting and conversing freely
               with its members during the interval, I labored faithfully until I have
               done something.—I have made me a book. And now, my book being made, it pleases me
               mightily. It pleases me so well in my own conceit that I have resolved to offer it to
               the world to read. I offer it.
            And, what is more!—I began to feel so complacent over my work before I had completed
               this first experimental book—though it is, indeed, like all of its class, of a
               character that is, after all, necessarily light, (so called,) in some 
                  repects
                  respects
               —that I resolved, the Divine Spark entreating me to utilize my
               inspirations, to undertake, and at once, something more pretentious. As intimated,
               the entreaty has been too urgent to be neglected. I have heeded it. I have commenced
               another book; and on that I have also labored faithfully, and also congratulate
               myself that I have succeeded very well; so well, that, no inopportune circumstance
               intervening to prevent, I shall be enabled to offer it with an approving judgment, to
               the world's approval not long after this appears. I have it now nearly completed.
            There you have the original influencing reasons which have impelled an Old
                  Bachelor to enter, and now being in, to strive to keep a place in the
                  Realms of Authordom.
            I am, criticising, and some say, kind, Public, your most affectionate, most
               sincere

              I.
               DIMOND: INTRODUCTORY—THE VALUE OF THE WOLF, THE FOX, AND THE BEAR, AS
                  EDUCATORS.
               FOURTEEN miles south-west from the gay and graceful little city of Rochester, a
                  pleasant summer morning drive through handsome, well-kept Pittsford, and sweet
                  blossoming Honeoye, brings you to the classic town of Lima.
               Lima is situated in one of the sweetest, most fertile nooks of the Eden garden,
                  Western New York. Satisfactorily perched on her commanding eminence, among rich,
                  wide-spreading fields and green pastures, authoritatively overlooking the leaping
                  flow of the fast-escaping Honeoye, ancient as the early days in the history of the
                     Phelps and Gorham Purchase, she has a renown and an influence
                  scarce second to any town of twice her size in these free and enlightened United
                  States.
               
                  Lima is a power in the land.
               Her influence extends for leagues around over a long circumference.
               As an eagerly sought place where the youth of the surrounding country may acquire
                  a refined, polished, and, at the same time, solid education, Lima has for a long
                  time enjoyed a deserved and great fame. The happy conjunction and advantages of a
                  healthful situation; easily accessible, fine natural scenery; embosoming,
                  surrounding society of unblemished
                  morals, and a corps of teachers whose native abilities and attainments of
                  education have always ranked with the best, have earned for her Seminary a
                  reputation that is acknowledged as superior to the far borders of the great State
                  of New York.
               Long before Rochester had a name, early in the history of this pleasant little
                  emporium of learning, she began to claim rank for supremacy with the imperial
                  Canandaigua, for many years the only center of wit and intelligence for the old
                     Phelps and Gorham Purchase. And, strong in the strength of the
                  superior endowments mentioned, she slowly, but surely fought her way, finally
                  conquering and taking the lead, until now she has not, really, a rival in many
                  long leagues.
               The schools of Palmyra, of Geneva, of Canandaigua, of Bath, of speaking,
                  up-springing little Mount Morris, of Batavia, of Rochester—and they all employ
                  talent, are well-conducted and select—compete with her in vain. Even the
                  celebrated Clover Street School for girls, in the latter city, scarce rivals, and
                  the powerful college of recent birth there, has, as yet, scarce more than rivaled,
                  her proud honors. Indeed, she levies tribute, and again lavishes her treasures of
                  royal knowledge far beyond the confines over which those centers of intelligence
                  exercise a controlling power.
               Go ask at hopeful Syracuse, at intellectual Auburn, at picturesquely attractive
                  Ithaca, proudest, most presuming of them all, at democratic Elmira, at
                  Hornellsville, at placid Le Roy, at Lockport, aspiring towns on and beyond the far
                  confines of the Old Purchase, and their best citizens will inform
                  you that some of their best and dearest hopes are entrusted to the fostering and
                  esteemed guardianship of Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, at Lima, New York.
               Lima is one of the brightest, most costly, precious gems set in the imperial
                  diadem worn by the aspiring guardian Genius of the peerless State. How well, among
                  the superior many, the school at this place exemplifies in its deeds the ruling
                  potency of her proud motto, Excelsior.
               To the extent that it undertakes to instruct, this school has not, probably, its
                  equal outside the New England States.
               As its name implies, the Lima school is conducted by the Methodists; but, before
                  proceeding further, I shall desire the reader not to imagine that, because I speak
                  so highly in its favor, I am attempting to laud Methodism. I do not
                  by any means undertake, particularly, anything of the kind. I do not, by any
                  means, profess that faith. Rather, instead of professing Methodism, and attempting
                  to promulgate the views of that sect, I am strongly opposed to the arrogant manner
                  in which those views are propagated in general; presuming the arrogancy, as is
                  intolerance in the Catholic, to be an inherency in that form of religion.
               But, if not professing the religion of the Methodists, I still, as I do also the
                  Catholic, award it a meed of praise and of glory, because, despite its loudness,
                  its arrogance, and its presumption,*
                   it has accomplished much and great good. Cognizant, to a considerable
                  extent, of its influences and accomplishments throughout the extent of country
                  over which my pen has traveled in getting thus far in my Introduction, I know that it has accomplished a great good through the agency of
                  the Lima school.
               
                  
                  *These particular qualities—loudness, arrogance and
                     presumption—which are somewhat peculiar with the sect, are
                     not so particularly noticeable where its members, as at Lima, comprise
                     integral portions of well-educated communities.
               
               And so, without attempting to explain why it is they have done, and
                  still continue to do, good, I write these things, then, of Lima and of the
                  Methodists, not because I am of that faith, but because they do do
                  good in the world, and more particularly because they immediately concern the
                  characters in my sketches, and because I like to give every one his due. And
                  because I like to give every one his due, I will further write that I am proud and
                  glad to say—though I cannot accept their doctrines—that some of the sweetest
                  characters who assist to sustain the life of the following sketches, passed some
                  of their best growing years at the Lima Seminary.
               And further: though Ida, Lucy, and Maud; though Chester, Boyd, and John Dimond,
                  may not have imbibed the peculiar faith of Methodism while they were at that
                  school, yet its influences exerted on their minds while there receiving the
                  benefits of the usual Academic or College course, must have had much to do with
                  imparting and developing, or at least toning the lovelinesses which
                  now distinguish their admirable characters. The strength and sweetness of their
                  characters—however much Nature may
                  dispose them to amiability—now discover to you, such of you as meet them from day
                  to day, and also you who read these sketches, that the Lima school did them
                  good.
               Much of the good they have accomplished, and of the positive, useful careers they
                  are carving for themselves, and which are already while they are yet in their
                  prime, bringing them into notice as talented and useful members of society, some
                  of them in both public and private capacities, can but be due to early
                  instructions received at that excellent seat of learning.
               So much established explanatory of antecedents, I advance without circumlocution
                  to the business pertaining to the first sketch in the series.
               
               It was to the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, within the sphere of
                  usefulness of the powerful educational institution at Lima, where many of his
                  descendants, eloquent subjects to give soul to these Leaves,
                  afterward received that culture which has so essentially assisted to constitute
                  them the useful and highly influential members of, and ornaments to society, that
                  they now are, that Israel Dimond removed with his young wife, Ruth, some time near
                  the year of grace, 1793.
               Like hundreds of others in the New England States he was early, and happily for
                  himself and subsequent numerous progeny, as it proved, lured to the Phelps and Gorham Tract—or to what may now be more properly styled the Lake Region of Western New York. The glowing tales of the marvelous
                  fertility and beauty of this region; of the deep, fat soil, of the luxuriant
                  Indian corn fields and orchards, of the great tall trees, of the shining lakes and
                  streams filled with salmon, bass, and other fine fishes, and of the long reaches
                  of gently rolling hill, and fair, pleasant vale, stretching in smiling verdure
                  from lovely Cayuga to rippling Genesee, and over whose flowing undulations ranged
                  thousands—tens of thousands of wild deer—these manifold attractions happily and
                  early enticed Israel Dimond from his impoverished acres in the East.
               It was such stories that, surely threading their sinuous course along tedious
                  miles of gloomy forest—dark forests extending long miles from the Lakes to the
                  Connecticut—through millions of acres of forest haunted by droves of savage
                  beasts—for what danger can prevent the spread of news that is to benefit the human
                  race?—it was such stories, so traveling to the more open Eastern States, that
                  attracted their inhabitants away.
               Early in the history of pioneer settlement Western New York came to be regarded by
                  New England as a land of beauty and bounty. Her hardy sons early dreamed their
                  promising day-visions of the wonderful West. As soon as discovered they learned to
                  look upon the Genesee country as a land teeming with a redundance of forest life
                  and prospective agricultural wealth in the future—a land eagerly to be sought by
                  those who were laboriously cultivating contracted fields that were already
                  becoming sterile.
               And in this instance it was wonderfully true, for once, that fame did not lie. The
                  tales were all true. There is no district of country of like extent in the whole
                  wide world, if, perhaps, Southern Michigan be excepted, that has so many
                  attractions for the enterprising agriculturist, as the Lake Region
                  of Western New York. The stories carried to the East by Mr. Phelps, who was one of
                  the first men on his purchase, by the French Duke,*
                   by many a hunter and venturesome explorer of its virgin solitudes,
                  portraying in inviting language the exceeding loveliness of its lakes and streams,
                  of the beautiful, flowing spread of hill and sweeping intervale, and of its
                  matchless fertility, have since been fully verified.
               
                  *
                     Liancourt. Between the years 1790 and 1800, he explored a
                     large extent of the wilderness then lying between the marshes of Syracuse
                     and Lake Erie. His account of his adventures in this region is quite
                     entertaining and probably truthful in the main; though Turner does not
                     regard him as veracious. Turner's language, however, I must say appears to
                     me to court the favor of members of the Society of Friends at the Duke's
                     expense. The sale of his "Pioneer History" depended on their
                     good will, to a considerable extent. Liancourt's account of his travels is
                     rather severe on the Quakers.
               
               When in its primeval state how beautifully and fitly was this fair region named by
                  the bold Iroquois their Great Long House. With one door at Niagara
                  and the other the marshes of Syracuse—with its spacious rooms always filled with
                  generous store of corn and meat, and kept always warmed by the protecting growth
                  of thick, wide forests, what a home it was for the roving Indian! There has never,
                  under the sun, been another like it. No wonder the Indians fought for it like
                  demons with one another; and none but the bravest, like the Iroquois, could ever
                  dwell therein.
               
               And since the bears and wolves have been killed, and the forests have been felled,
                  and the grand parlors of the Great Long House have been thrown open
                  to the sun, how fair and rich, and gorgeous do their carpets lay, bathed in his
                  genial, generous day-beams! What a multiplicity of treasures—of gem and of
                  ornament are lavishly spread over their variegated surfaces.
               Who is there that has once beheld the lovely waters of Cayuga and Seneca, of
                  Canandaigua, and of limpid Genesee—"Pleasant Water"—that has once
                  traveled (not by railroad or canal) over the fruitful, smiling undulations
                  extending from Syracuse and Ithaca to Le Roy and Lockport, that would not gladly
                  journey there and behold the beauties of that fair land again?
               
               Many of the first settlers in this fine field of promise came from the old colony
                  of Massachusetts; its fame early attracting some of the best of her blood. Then,
                  as she has so repeatedly since, the prolific, generous old mother gave freely of
                  her treasures of intellect, of pure blood, and of enduring muscle, towards the
                  founding of a new sovereignty. She gave a race of men that have no peers; for,
                  though most of them are famed only in local history, there are no men in the
                  United States, or in the world, of brighter minds, of purer morals, and of hardier
                  physical constitutions than are the thousands and thousands who answer to such
                  names as Bates, Comstock, Parker, Richards, Willits, Wood, Aldrich, Packard, Reed,
                  Lapham, Herendeen, Delano, Powers, Wilkinson, Peters, Purdy, Cuyler, Hathaway,
                  Allen, Brooks, Robinson, Bennett, Beal, etc., etc., pioneers on the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, and many of them from Massachusetts.
               It is with such stock that the Dimond family take rank. And the first of this name
                  to appear in the wild Lake Region came also from the old Bay State.
                  Naturally intelligent and resolute; tall, athletic, and capable to sustain extreme
                  physical endurance, Israel Dimond was well fitted to encounter and conquer the
                  hardships of a pioneer life. Gifted with a hard, shrewd, native good sense, which
                  his limited education had never developed into the desire to attain intellectual
                  pre-eminence, he was just the man to seek and accept, without repining, the lot
                  that he sought.
               You have seen just such men—men so keen and vigorous, mentally, that you cannot
                  "fool 'em" about anything, yet caring more to be able to tumble an antagonist in a
                  wrestle, to leap fifteen feet at a single bound, to "shoulder" four bushels of
                  wheat, and to own a big farm of fertile acres, than for all the newspapers and all
                  the literature under the sun; but still, never casting those blessings entirely
                  aside as worthless. They apprehend much of their value, but their hearts are set
                  on other things.
               Mr. Dimond's wife was of like character with himself. Simple, cheerful and hardy;
                  of strong, keen mind, but possessing but a limited number of living ideas, she was
                  just the woman to delight in keeping tidy the cabin of the back-woodsman—to find
                  her greatest pleasure in cheering him on in his labors, and to bear and rear
                  strong, healthy children to his name. So, very naturally, and very early, when the
                  tide of emigration from the East set in to the beautiful Lake Region
                  of Western New York, Mr. Dimond and his faithful helpmeet were wisely astir,
                  anxious to dig in the soil, and perfectly willing that others should monopolize
                  the books for a season. Purchasing of Mr. Phelps a title to a rich domain of some
                  five hundred acres of tall forest in the heart of this teeming region, he and his
                  brave wife joined a forming company of emigrants, and with them turned their faces
                  toward the new Canaan. Driving their cattle before them, their heavily laden vans
                  being dragged slowly by strong oxen, the persevering, hopeful company toiled a
                  slow month along through the wilderness to Canandaigua.
               Arrived here, they separated, each youthful couple buoyed by brave hearts, seeking
                  their respective homestead. Mr. Dimond, accompanied by two or three of the party
                  with whose lands his own were contiguous, branched off to their location, about a
                  day's drive from Canandaigua, and some twenty or twenty-five miles from the site
                  where Rochester now stands. Arriving at their new homes in the wilderness, where
                  there had never yet been a tree cut—where they had no better shelter than had the
                  wolves and bears—Mr. Dimond set to work at once, and resolutely, to hew his way to
                  independence.
               
                  He hewed it.
               
               Long years passed, certainly, before his iron frame and iron will had conquered
                  the severe task his iron mind had set
                  them; but, eventually, he could proudly sit down in the shade of his own tree and
                  vine, cast his keen eyes out over broad acres of verdant pasture and meadow, and
                  proudly say:
               "These broad, rich fields are mine, and I made them; can you claim to
                  have done as much?"
               Like a grandson-in-law who subsequently nobly imitated him in one of the Western
                  States, and whom you may read about in the next paper, he fed Indians to
                  conciliate and keep them from his wife and precious babes; killed bears and wolves
                  as he met them; cut down the tall trees and rolled them together and burned them
                  up, and made his five hundred acres into sweeping, fruitful fields.
               Indomitable, energetic, tireless; one of those who could speed two hundred miles
                  and back, on foot, uncomplaining, through the gloomy woods, to get a little wine
                  for a sick woman; who, rather than do without, could pole their barges of salt for
                  many a weary mile up the shallow, freezing streams, taking barge, salt, and all
                  from the water to roll them through snow and ice, up and around long reaches of
                  drift-wood—one of the persevering, unyielding men who performed such deeds, or
                  similar, Israel Dimond fought wild beasts, conciliated Indians, made his five
                  hundred acres of forest into sweeping, inviting fields—fields green, grassy,
                  golden, fruitful, and reared a family of fine children, successfully to adult,
                  intelligent years, giving them the benefits of plenty of work, plenty of ranging
                  in the wilderness on the hunter's trackless trail, and the advantages of the best
                  schools within his reach.
               For many years he labored faithfully and with untiring industry, enduring
                  numberless privations and dangers before he had accomplished these happy results.
                  But, gaining and adding little by little, patiently and faithfully, from year to
                  year, he succeeded at last; and success is usually regarded as betokening merit.
                  And in Mr. Dimond's case, as it has been in thousands that are similar,
                     Success was Merit. Even to fell a single giant tree is, in a way,
                  a matter of immense moment to the novice in chopping, as it is to the school-boy
                  when he accomplishes his first well-written composition. How much more, then, is
                  it to make a farm in the forest, as it also is to write an Essay that shall awaken
                  a world!
               As detailed instances of the difficulties and dangers the early pioneers
                  encountered, and which also illustrate traits of character, and therefore discover
                  to the light some of the moral antecedents which, as well as Methodism, must have
                  had a marked and weighty influence in molding the characters of his descendants,
                  the author will jot down two or three of the many interesting anecdotes he has
                  heard old Mr. Dimond—now an old man passed away—relate concerning their wilderness
                  life.
               These anecdotes are substantially—almost strictly—true, as I shall relate them,
                  and have never before been given to the public in any local chronicle, or
                  otherwise.
               The distance of the early settlers in the Lake Region from market,
                  even for several years after first settlement, rendered the produce of their farms
                  nearly valueless. Many were in debt for their lands for long years before they
                  were enabled to make payment.*
                   Often they were at their wits ends to get wherewith to satisfy the
                  government for taxes.†
                   Some were compelled to hunt for the purpose; others resorted to the
                  laborious expedient of felling their noble maples and elms, rolling them together,
                  and burning them merely for the ashes from which to make a little of the salable
                  potash; and still others sought other expedients as pitiful.
               
                  
                  *
                     Turner, History of P. and G. P., says, substantially: That if
                     it had not been for the good will of Mr. Williamson, agent for the London
                     Company, who succeeded Messrs. P. & G., and that most of the settlers
                     had purchased on long credits, they could never have paid for their lands.
                     As early as A. D. 1800, when the inhabitants of this region were
                     comparatively few, the Company had advanced to agents and for
                     improvements more than a million dollars.
               
               
                  
                  †
                     Durfee, Sibley and Wadsworth in P. and G. P.
               
               This state of affairs continued for a long time. After ten or twelve years of
                  their stay in the wilderness the pioneers were no better situated, as regarded
                  getting money, than at the commencement.
               It was at about this time one winter that the taxes were becoming due, and Mr.
                  Dimond and his nearest neighbor, with whom he often labored and hunted in company,
                  had absolutely nothing but horses, cattle and hogs—otherwise and intrinsically
                  valuable, but absolutely unsalable, unless at the most ruinous of sacrifices—and
                  grain in their barns, which would scarce pay the expense of hauling to market,
                  with which to pay taxes. What was to be done? Government did not accept such stock
                  in lieu of currency. Its one sole cry was
                  money! money!! more money!!! But money Mr. Dimond and his friend did not have, and
                  scarce knew how to get. They were in despair, until one night after he had gone to
                  bed Mr. Dimond's mind suddenly became illumined with a bright thought.
               The government paid a nice little sum as bounty for the scalp of the wolf; and the
                  traders, such men as John J. Astor, gave a good price for fox skins.*
                   He had hunted so little in the past years, from a desire for profit, the
                  idea had not before naturally entered his mind, as it might have done had there
                  been anything among his occupations to prompt or suggest it. Now, however, he saw
                  his way out of the difficulty; and though he had never, like the hunter Pratt,
                  hunted wolves and foxes for gain—being principled against hunting unless as a
                  relaxation from labor, or as a means to ensure safety to his family and
                  property—he now decided it was really necessary to hunt for pay.
               
                  
                  *Stephen Durfee, of Palmyra, says, in P. and G. P., that he has taken peltry
                     to the value of fifty dollars in a single winter. Pretty good for a farmer,
                     when we consider the low price of skins in those days, and that he also had
                     his "chores" and other labor to do.
               
               Wolves and foxes were now scarce to what they had been, to be sure—they had been
                  hunted and destroyed so much by others—still, he believed there were yet enough
                  about to help himself and his worthy neighbor along, if they could but be so
                  fortunate as to get them.
               Communicating his happy thought to his neighbor, they set about scouring the
                  forest for wolf signs at once. Prosecuting the business with diligence, as they
                  did everything they employed themselves about, they were soon rewarded with
                  success, holing a long-legged, heavy old fellow on a neighboring hill retired in
                  the forest, on the first day of search.
               The same evening they set their only trap. It being a large, heavy, steel concern,
                  manufactured purposely for wolves and bears, and being well planted at the mouth
                  of the hole, they were hopeful of results. The trap set, they went home, went to
                  bed, slept and waited.
               Early the next morning, it being nearer his residence than that of his friend, Mr.
                  Dimond was first to visit the scene of discovery of the day before. Lo! the trap
                  was gone; chain, stake and all, dragged off by Sir Lupus, their aristocratic prey,
                  whose leg was in the gripping jaws of sharp teeth—very securely in—and whose trail
                  from his secluded lair was broadly perceptible in the snow.
               Mr. Dimond hastened at once to his friend's residence and alarmed him. The two,
                  taking, one an axe, the other a gun, immediately started in pursuit; but though
                  expeditious, the wolf having been gone several hours—getting into the trap early
                  in the night—led them a long chase.
               All day long they followed, over hill and valley, plowing through snow, wading
                  swamps and bridging streams with the ready axe and convenient tree—all day long
                  they toiled after their ten dollars, through the snow and water, boots torn, feet
                  wet and freezing and not a morsel of food to eat—expecting but a short hunt, they
                  had not provided themselves with provisions;—all day long, with famishing stomachs
                  and freezing feet, until the fall of evening, they patiently and perseveringly
                  hunted the trail, when they were rewarded by overtaking the chase.
               All day long they followed, until about nightfall, when they tracked their gaunt,
                  savage victim to a large, upright, hollow tree where he had taken refuge, and had
                  got the chain of the trap so entangled and wound around a root or some sort of
                  jagged projection on the inside of the hollow, that he was detained there a
                  prisoner. As soon as they had discovered the ugly beast, and apprehended his
                  enforced detention in his new situation, the question arose, how to get him.
               The aperture to the hollow was so small and so situated on the side of the tree,
                  its base resting on the ground, that the wolf could easily screen his vital parts
                  from the attacks of his pursuers. Mr. Dimond, perceiving at a glance the advantage
                  held by their quarry, who also seemed to comprehend and take the advantage of his
                  position, refrained from wasting powder.
               He thought for a few moments: "Shall we cut the tree down?" "No!" it was very
                  large, had a thick shell, and was dead, dry and hard; the task would be too severe
                  after the fatiguing day's march. He thought of a better plan.
               Setting his gun against a neighboring tree, he immediately reached his hand into
                  the aperture, seized hold of the chain and exerted his strength to drag the wolf
                  from his refuge, warning his companion to hold his axe in readiness to despatch
                  him as soon as he should pull him out.
               
               He pulled towards himself, and was soon exerting all his strength, but pull as
                  hard as he would, he could not bring the wolf out; the old fellow was so large and
                  so strong that he clung with his three remaining feet to his place with a tenacity
                  that one man could not overcome.
               What was to be done? The opening of the hollow was so small, and the thickness of
                  the shell of the tree was so great that but one man at a time could cling to the
                  chain, and besides it would not be prudent for both to be tugging at it when they
                  should succeed in tearing him from his hold.
               Mr. Dimond paused to reflect; finally he spoke, saying:
               "Welcome! I will pull one foot across the edge of the opening, and
                     thee must cut it off while I keep the beast's leg stretched
                  taut."
               He was a member of the Society of Friends or Quakers, though none of his
                  grandchildren ever professed the faith of that sect, or ever practiced, as a rule
                  of life, any of its simple austerities.
               As he ceased speaking, Mr. Dimond drew one of the wolf's hind feet out and hard
                  across the edge of the shell of the tree trunk, as he had intimated. Welcome
                  struck with the axe; instantly the maimed animal jerked his shortened leg back
                  into the hollow, leaving his foot in the man's possession.
               He threw the foot on the ground and instantly seized the other hind leg, again
                  striving with all his strength to drag the huge wolf to him, but tug and strain as
                  hard as he would, he could not conquer the resistance of the remaining fore feet.
                  Again he drew the leg taut across the edge of the shell, repeating:
               "Welcome! thee must cut again."
               Welcome struck, and another foot was severed.
               "Now, then," said Mr. Dimond, "I will pull out a fore foot, and thee must cut that
                  off also, because it will not do to pull him out by that; he would surely seize me
                  before thee could despatch him."
               He drew forth a fore foot from the hole. Welcome did as directed, and the
                  fearless, persevering men had three of the wolf's feet to themselves.
               "Now," continued the leader, "I shall pull the wolf out, and thee must strike him
                  with the axe, effectively, as soon as thee can, or he may yet seize me with his
                  sharp teeth."
               He had no sooner ceased speaking than he grasped a hind leg and dragged the wolf
                  through the aperture very quickly—so quickly that the celerity of the movement,
                  accompanied by a simultaneous dodging of the victim, slightly confused Welcome. He
                  struck with the axe, but, for the reasons named, the blow was wild. Instantly, the
                  maddened and ferocious brute, using the leg to which the man was clinging, for a
                  purchase, swung his ugly head up towards his captor's face, and fastened his fangs
                  in his shoulder.
               "Welcome! thy knife! thee must be quick!" calmly said the quiet young Quaker.
               "Yes! yes! don't be afraid, but hang on to him," responded Welcome, promptly.
               Welcome threw down his axe, drew his butcher's knife from his belt, and
                  immediately slipped its length, eight inches, into the wolf's body, just back of
                  the fore shoulder. It cut the heart of the animal nearly into halves.
               "Ah! thee has done well, Welcome. I guess we shall get something yet with which to
                  pay taxes."
               As the unflinching man ceased his speech, the conquered wolf loosened his hold on
                  his shoulder, and collapsed to the ground, dead, almost without a struggle.
               That ended the affair. The wounds in Mr. Dimond's shoulder were severe, but being
                  only in the flesh, the weather being cool, and he being young, healthy, and with
                  pure blood in his veins, they speedily healed. He suffered no inconvenience from
                  the bite after two or three days; soon after, when he had cured his chilblains
                  somewhat, commencing his chopping for the winter, when occurred another little
                  episode of interest, which added to his small store of tax money, and which I will
                  write about presently.
               After flaying their wolf, the two men started on their return home. They had not
                  proceeded far on the way, when they discovered, to their great satisfaction, that,
                  though they had followed their game nearly all day, they were really but about ten
                  miles from home. The wolf, besides zigzagging a great deal in his course, had led
                  them some twenty miles instead of ten, on the detour of a deep semicircle, to the
                  spot where they found him.
               Pursuing, therefore, a direct course, they arrived about nine o'clock in the
                  evening at the cabin nearest them, a
                  newly erected house of logs that was only about five miles from where they dwelt.
                  Here the hardy advance guard in the wilderness informed the weary and famishing
                  hunters that he had in store plenty of pork and plenty of corn.
               The good woman of the house commenced at once to prepare them some supper.
                  Roasting some corn and frying them some pork, they were not long in filling their
                  hungry stomachs with the substantial food; then, resuming gun, axe, trap, and
                  newly acquired wolf skin and ears, they journeyed toward home, where they arrived,
                  well pleased with the day's adventure, just before midnight.
               In the course of a week after the wolf adventure, after the bitten shoulder and
                  the frozen toes had healed, Mr. Dimond commenced his usual winter's chopping, soon
                  after which occurred the second adventure that I will relate.
               Every day for about a week after he had commenced his chopping, there was a fox
                  came at evening, just as he was about to quit work for the day, and played in
                  sportive gambols on some banks of snow that were in close proximity. Mr. Dimond
                  passed him many times, (observing keenly, though not appearing to do so,) the fox
                  refusing to run away at his approach, barely keeping beyond his reach, and always
                  grinning, laughing, and sporting the more gaily, the nearer he was approached,
                  though the keen eye of the interested observer perceived that the wily animal was
                  prepared to spring from under his feet sooner than be trodden upon, or be too
                  closely menaced with danger. This was repeated many times, Reynard getting bolder
                  and bolder, as he found he was not molested, running, leaping and plowing his
                  furry shoulders along in the snow, and keeling over repeatedly, again and again,
                  laughing and sliding about, almost under the man's feet, while enjoying his
                  fanciful, antic gambols, and seeming to say, in his cunning fox language:
               "I know you, Mr. Man! You haven't any gun to shoot me, and you can't catch me to
                  hurt me—I'm so much spryer than you."
               And where was Mr. Dimond's gun all this time?
               Hanging safe over the door in his good log house, where it had hung ever since the
                  wolf adventure, flintless, and therefore, for the time, useless. While returning
                  home on the day he and his neighbor caught the wolf, he had lost his only flint,
                  and had not since made an errand to Canandaigua for anything, where he might get a
                  new supply. He might have made a fire near where he chopped, and, after sighting,
                  have touched a live coal, held in readiness, to the priming of his gun, and thus
                  have killed the fox. "But," said he, when relating the anecdote afterwards—
               "I had no notion to burn my nose in that manner. And besides, I thought to myself:
                  Thee is, no doubt, a very cunning little animal, but I guess I shall outwit thee
                  before we get through with it."
               So Mr. Dimond, being a man who seldom struck unless sure of his mark, never threw
                  his axe, nor clubs, nor fired his gun at the wily animal, but placidly
                  contemplated, with Quaker serenity, the merry, tantalizing antic gambols played
                  just under his nose, and all the while kept up a "terrible thinking."
               All the time while the fox was playing, he was thinking.
               The result of his study was, that, after the sportive fox had played in the banks
                  of snow for about a week, and had become entirely fearless, Mr. Dimond built a dead-fall, or kind of trap, in his favorite bank one morning before
                  commencing his day's labor.
               His trap built to suit himself, he chopped lustily through the day, until evening.
                  That same evening Reynard came to play, as usual. As he had done so many times
                  before, while the more cunning man was fatefully watching him, he came bounding
                  lightly and gracefully on to the familiar banks of snow. Poor fellow! it was the
                  last time he ever played. He had made but a few of his usual graceful, sportive
                  skips and leaps, when the treacherous snow crust gave way underneath him, and he
                  was entrapped. The days of his cunning were ended.
               "Thee ought to have seen how 'shamed the beast looked when I went to dispatch him
                  with my axe, and it had come to be my turn to laugh," humorously said the old
                  Quaker, a merry laugh sparkling out from his eyes, as he finished relating the
                  story to me.
               It was but a few months after the incident relating to the facetious fox had
                  transpired, that Mr. Dimond himself got caught—and caught, too, in a manner that
                  portended great danger. But though he was in considerable peril for a time, it
                  left no lasting impression of fear on his mind. He always afterwards, when relating the adventure,
                  narrated the particulars with much amusement to himself as well as to the eager
                  listener, remarking at the proper culmination that "he must have cut quite a
                  ridiculous figure, could any one but have seen him."
               The time of this amusing, as well as memorable occurrence was late in August. One
                  Sunday afternoon, the sky heavily overcast for that time in the year, and the
                  walking cool and pleasant, he was taking his usual walk for that day of the week,
                  around his premises, to see that his cattle were all right, fences all up, etc.,
                  etc.
               He was alone, and at the time, negligently and unusually for him, walking unarmed.
                  He seldom walked forty rods from his house without carrying a weapon of some kind,
                  either gun or axe; but now he had not even a knife in his pocket. His wife, having
                  occasion to use his long-bladed, heavy pocket knife the day before, had called for
                  it, and had not yet returned it, as she ought, and he had not remembered to ask it
                  of her.
               Men who are supposed to always carry all their faculties with them, do sometimes,
                  and unaccountably, as it seems, walk unwittingly and unprepared into fearful
                  danger.
               So now Mr. Dimond.
               Commencing his tour of inspection, he walked leisurely back from his house
                  alongside his twenty acres of corn—the farther end late planted, and consequently
                  just now succulent for the wild denizens of the forest—and, Quaker fashion, and in
                  keeping with the spirit of the day, calmly climbed the last obstructing fence and
                  entered his forty acres of stumpy pasture. He had not advanced far into the
                  pasture when his placid repose of mind and of manner were suddenly and alarmingly
                  disturbed.
               How often are fair, promising plans and pleasant trains of thought rudely shocked
                  and broken up!
               Mr. Dimond had advanced but a few rods from the fence toward the wood when,
                  happening to glance diagonally back over his left shoulder in the direction of the
                  cornfield, he discovered the ugly she-bear, accompanied by the inevitable two fine
                  young cubs which range with her at this time in the year, bearing swiftly and
                  boldly down upon him.
               He was a quarter of a mile from the house, and the bear very near. There was no
                  help for it: he must either accept the terrible hug or take to a tree—unless,
                  indeed he were prepared to test a favorite and somewhat whimsical theory of
                  his.
               He had often reflected, and said, that if he could but get unharmed on a bear's
                  back, with a good knife in his hand, get his legs locked around his loins and in
                  front of his hind legs, with one arm securely hugging the animal's neck, he could
                  easily kill him, and with impunity to himself. Mr. Dimond thought now was an
                  excellent opportunity to establish the soundness of his unique theory—only, 
                     unfortuately
                     unfortunately
                  , he had not the valuable and indispensable knife at command—the
                  disturbing woman who mars some, as well as helps to make some other, splendid
                  plans, had it.
               Prudently, then, he decided to avail himself of the aid of the friendly and useful
                  tree. He looked about him eagerly and quickly. As it happened, and as he saw and
                  remembered as soon as he had swiftly surveyed his surroundings, the only tree
                  within safe distance—a tree he had allowed to escape his clearing operations to
                  grow for purposes of shade—was very small, scarce large enough to sustain his
                  weight, he feared.
               He hesitated.
               Should he accept the small, the very small tree, liable to be
                  attacked at a great disadvantage if it should not sustain his weight, or should he
                  attempt to maintain his ground by fighting the bear naked handed?—Which was the
                  better prospect for victory, or safety, even? He has since said that he believed
                  at the time he could have whipped her brown majesty in a fair fight, without
                  weapons—and I think possibly he might: he was alert, supple and courageous, and
                  must have been very powerful in his prime, capable to strike a terrible blow, and
                  to give a terrible gripe to a bear's throat if he should once get his hand to
                  grasp it; but meantime the bear must have torn him fearfully.
               So now, thinking of the sharp, cruel claws and the gleaming, wicked teeth, he
                  decided a second time, and happily, as it soon proved, to trust to the little
                  tree.
               He ran to the little shade tree and sprang into it. He was up just as the bear
                  came rolling angrily under in pursuit, having barely time to draw his feet away
                  from her first fierce spring, which was made viciously enough, the brute growling
                  savagely and snapping sharp.
               
               Then, at the height he had attained, only a little distance above the bear's
                  reach, the sapling, not large and stiff enough to bear itself upright under the
                  added weight, began to bend. Down, down it went—down toward the ground and toward
                  the bear, Mr. Dimond going with it, of course, and perforce, according to the laws
                  of gravity, or fate, however unwillingly to himself. And unfortunately, but
                  naturally, as you will learn when you climb bending saplings, he was on the under
                  side—he was underneath the trunk of the little tree, the tails of his Sunday coat
                  hanging down.
               Brownie quickly perceived her advantage, you may be sure, and immediately sprang a
                  second time, fastening her shining teeth in the dangling cloth—good stout stuff,
                  such as was made in those benighted times—she nearly pulled the tree to the ground
                  before it tore; then up the man went, and swiftly over the other way until his
                  elastic support struck the rebound, which instantly sent him back again within
                  easy reach of his tormentor's jaws.
               Again the bear improved her opportunity, getting another good piece of coat-tail,
                  the man, fearful she would strike deeper and get something more, all the time
                  striving with all his might to get on the top of the sapling and beyond her
                  reach.
               And again and again, and yet again, many times, as he swiftly receded, and as
                  often again inevitably returned within easy reach, did the wicked brute jump and
                  seize his clothing and pull him down. And again and again, many times, often as
                  the good cloth would tear, would he start anew and with accelerated momentum on
                  his flying career—like a girl in an inverted swing—and all the time exerting
                  himself to his utmost to get on the upper side of the tree.
               But to get atop, he could not for a good while—the bear catching her teeth in his
                  protecting clothing and pulling him back to the under side many times, and as
                  often as he would get part way up; though it is probable his continued strivings,
                  and getting so nearly beyond her reach so many times, and just at the critical
                  instant, saved his flesh from the gleaming, hungering teeth that would so
                  willingly have torn and lacerated it.
               This novel and laughable manner of flying at the behest of his persecuting foe,
                  forth and back, forth and back, repeatedly, and so many times, for a man to engage
                  in, continued, Mr. Dimond thinks, for about ten minutes, and until she had got all
                  his coat-tails and also some pretty good sized gores from the seat of his
                  pantaloons. At the end of that time, getting desperate, the strong and wiry man
                  made one superhuman effort and succeeded in getting atop of his royal arch, where,
                  as it soon considerably ceased its swaying, as he was allowed to become quiet, he
                  maintained himself, with the aid of its friendly limbs, beyond the reach of his
                  persevering and persecuting enemy.
               But if she could not molest to injure him, the bear did not by any means desert
                  Mr. Dimond. She immediately placed herself on guard, and for a long time watched
                  him faithfully. She had no notion of relinquishing so valuable a prize.
               Mr. Dimond was treed about two o'clock in the afternoon. The watchful bear
                  enforced his stay in the little tree until about four, guarding him with the
                  strictest attention for the first hour. At the end of that time, getting impatient
                  of delay, the knowing brute relaxed her vigilance somewhat, and began to exercise
                  stratagem to lure her anticipated victim from his place of safety.
               According to the trapped man's account of her conduct her method of procedure was
                  quite interesting and entertaining. She seemed to be indued with mind and reason
                  to a considerable degree of excellence.
               Retreating a few yards from the tree—having first, as she supposed, disposed of
                  her young ones beyond the reach of harm—she would pause, secrete herself behind
                  some large, black, burned stump, and there wait a few minutes for the man to
                  improve his time.
               Said Mr. Dimond:
               "It was amusing, very amusing, though provoking, too, while I remembered my
                  situation and how tired I was getting, to see the saucy beast peek
                  cautiously out from behind a great black stump to ascertain if I was not preparing
                  to get down and go home."
               But the man not getting down, not seeming to appreciate and take advantage of her
                  clemency or apparent remissness, she would, after a little, return and keep guard
                  as before, but staying by him but a little while, when she would again trot
                  carelessly out among the numerous stumps,
                  halting within what she deemed a secure distance, and again secrete herself.
               But it was a long time before her cunning took effect and persuaded the man to get
                  down. She repeated her crafty stroke of policy many times, at each time increasing
                  the distance between herself and the coveted prey, before it had the desired
                  effect.
               At last, however, to all appearances for the time, she triumphed. At the
                  expiration of about two hours from the time when he first sought refuge in the
                  tree, one time when she was walking carelessly off she got so far away that Mr.
                  Dimond decided he might run for it. Accordingly he dropped from his uneasy perch
                  in the air and immediately sped towards his house, the bear detecting his movement
                  and pursuing on the instant, and with alacrity.
               But sagacious Bruin having miscalculated the relative powers of the two to make
                  speed, the man won in the well contested race that followed. I suppose she had not
                  reflected how young, lithe, and supple Mr. Dimond was; that he was tall, had long
                  legs, could step nearly seven feet at a step when running, and could leap a
                  nine-rail fence without touching it, as easily as could a deer.
               However, Mrs. Bear had given the opportunity, the man had improved it, had dropped
                  from the friendly sapling, and now away they were speeding, pursuer and pursued,
                  swift as maddened vengeance. Away they sped, careering along the lane alongside of
                  the cornfield, "nip and tuck! nip and tuck!" lightly leaping
                  obstructing bars and gate as they occurred, and then again, "nip and tuck!
                     nip and tuck!" the entire distance to the house. The pursuit was hot and
                  close to the chase, "nip and tuck! nip and tuck!" critical as to
                  which should win, all the way; but, happily, Mr. Dimond's unexampled fleetness of
                  foot brought him safely to his house a few paces in advance, where, when arrived,
                  he burst in like a West India hurricane upon his wife, where she quietly sat
                  reading her Bible to their young progeny who were gathered in a listening group
                  about her.
               He was no sooner inside the house than he instantly reached up over the door and
                  jerked down his old "Continental;" his wife springing to her feet, impulsively
                  closing her book with a slap, and exclaiming hurriedly as she noticed the
                  dilapidated state of his best apparel and caught the intensity of his manner:
               "W'y! what's the matter with thee, Israel? What's thee been doing?"
               Without pausing, Israel quickly rushed out at the door again, replying, and a
                  little spitefully, as he went:
               "I'll fix her! The beast! Tear my garments all off and keep me in a tree all the
                  afternoon will she?"
               The bear perceiving her now vengeful enemy leap out at the door and hurry toward
                  her, seemed to suspect the changed state of affairs at once. She turned and fled
                  in turn. But she was too late. The simple little hollow iron tube in the hands of
                  man is a powerful persuader. One discharge of the serviceable old musket and her
                  minutes were numbered. The fire of her aggressive nature was 
                     quenced
                     quenched
                   forever.
               "There, Ruth! my good coat is destroyed, but I guess I've got something in its
                  place that I can sell to help pay taxes when young Astor comes along again, and
                  that's about as good," remarked Mr. Dimond as he re-entered the door, procured
                  ammunition, and commenced to reload his gun.
               The gun loaded and primed, and his knife obtained of his wife, he went in search
                  of the cubs, both of which he secured before dark.
               When Mr. Dimond laid off his Sunday clothes on retiring that night his wife laid
                  them by never to be resumed again. His Sunday coat was in shreds and ruined; and I
                  may as well inform the reader that he was unable to get another for ten years. His
                  pants—breeches in those days—were also badly damaged, and were not replaced any
                  sooner than was the coat. But, reader, please bear in mind that as an offset he
                  got the old bear and her cubs. He had three bear skins to exhibit as trophies of
                  the conqueror. And to conquer, even in small matters, as I have already hinted,
                  sometimes signifies considerable in this world full of "struggles for
                  existence."
               Such was the man—a man of hard, iron-enduring nerve and sinew—a man of hard,
                  iron-enduring mind—a mind which, if not yet as fully expanded as it will be in his
                  descendants, is still a mind subtle, deep and strong in its bent—a man of fair,
                  square, pleasing features, with wife to
                  match, who, after thirty years of unflinching, unassisted struggle, becomes the
                  master of a fine estate, of houses filled with tenants, of capacious barns stored
                  with grain, of broad pastures teeming with sleek, fat cattle, who is, think and
                  say what you may to the contrary, as much of a lord on his domain as is the
                  Virginia planter at home, or as is the titled English peer chasing deer in his
                  native ancestral park; and more than all, this happy, prosperous American lord is
                  also become the proud father of five fine children—two sons and three daughters,
                  comely men and women both in mind and in person, handsome and brave, both sexes,
                  tall and well made, strong and enduring, tenacious of purpose and of upright
                  character.
               It is of the children of these five children—the grandchildren of old Israel
                  Dimond, now wearing his eternal crown—a family of men and women inheriting all the
                  good qualities, both mental and physical, improved upon, of their progenitors;
                  their forms, while as strong and lithe, more undulating and graceful of movement;
                  features elongated from the square and more expanse of forehead, and therefore
                  more symmetric and more artistically beautiful and perfect; whose minds are
                  broader, more comprehensive and far-reaching; and whose hearts are equally as
                  brave, chivalric and generous—it is of these children, admirable, hopeful men and
                  women of to-day of whom the sketches in this volume principally treat.
               Immediately, it is the children of Roswell, the eldest son of the brave,
                  enterprising pioneer, Israel Dimond, who claim the chief share of the reader's
                  attention.
               No doubt their cousins, the sons and daughters of his other sons and daughters,
                  are many of them as meritorious in many respects—have lived lives that would
                  afford events as worthy the pen of the biographer or the conscientious
                  story-teller, but the author (making one or two exceptions) not having learned so
                  much of their personal experiences as he can desire—he is, in truth, but slightly
                  acquainted with most of them, and with some of them not at all—will not of course
                  undertake to trace out their histories, or any portions thereof. But if in the
                  future he shall become perfectly acquainted with any event in the life of any
                  other member of this distinguished and estimable family which he may deem to be of
                  sufficient moment, he will endeavor to obtain the proper sanction from the
                  illustrious actor and write it out for the instruction and entertainment of the
                  reading public. And he will assure the interested reader of these pieces of
                  biographies that he hardly thinks there can ever have transpired any particular
                  episode in the life of any grandchild of the late Israel Dimond but that it
                  deserve record in that form which is imperishable; namely, in the book.
               The account of any incident in the life of any one of these praiseworthy and
                  remarkable scions from the old pilgrim stock can but be of interest to almost any
                  reader.
               And now, before closing this introduction, the writer would say that there is one
                  vital point—a point on which the beauty and strength of character of the persons,
                  fragments of whose lives are delineated in these sketches, seem to hinge, to which
                  he would particularly invite the reflective reader's attention. It appears to him
                  that the matter to which he alludes is of immense significance to the human race,
                  and that the philosopher and the humanitarian should thus regard it and give it
                  their attention. Briefly stated, before proceeding to a more elaborate
                  explanation, the question is, that, despite a whole world full of illustrations
                  that may be produced to the contrary, and, as may be said, not one single item of
                  evidence in its favor, yet the most perfect mental, and the most perfect physical
                  growth may be made to harmonize in the same individual.
               An attentive perusal of the sketches will instruct the reader that the old spirit
                  of enterprise—a spirit born of the combined powers—moral and intellectual
                  perception, and engrafted on and bravely sustained by hope, resolution, energy,
                  etc.—the desire to encounter and conquer the perils and difficulties incident to a
                  life in the American wilderness—that greatness of soul dwelling inherent in the
                  bosom of the pioneer which gladly courted trials and dangers of all kinds while in
                  pursuit of a competency, and more particularly to promote his own and the highest
                  welfare of his offspring, and which Turner lauds so highly in his history of The Purchase in connection with his own family name—I say, that, an
                  attentive perusal of this book will instruct the reader that that old spirit of
                  enterprise still lives, in so far as the writer's friends in the sketches are
                  concerned, with unabated strength and power in the souls of the grandchildren of
                  the original pioneer.
               
               A perusal of the sketches will instruct, that, this spirit, burning in their souls
                  with all the old primitive fire, has scattered the family—not for the sake of
                  roaming, but thinkingly, to accomplish the highest possible destinies within their
                  power to achieve—even to the grandchildren, to the four quarters of the globe; and
                  this in the face of the numberless seductions incident to civilization, such as
                  Luxuries, Letters, etc., etc.; he will discover that though the grandchildren are
                  more amply endowed, intellectually, and therefore more amenable to the softening,
                  refining influence of Letters, an influence that, as it always has
                  been and is applied, sanctioning a thousand effeminating luxuries,
                  always tends to enervate the physical powers, say what you please—he will discover
                  that despite the adverse influences to the perfection of the physical man, named,
                  yet are those grandchildren as strong and supple, as perfect physically, as
                  virile, as were their physically perfect progenitors, Israel and Ruth Dimond.
               There is the question again.
               Why? Why is it? Why have those children, while distancing their progenitors so far
                  intellectually, still kept pace with them physically, and thus stand out from
                  among their kind an anomaly in this particular?
               The thought insinuates itself that supreme, yes educated supreme
                     intellect and supreme virility may be compatible with
                  each other in the same person—that it may be possible to rear a race of men and
                  women that shall be eminently superior, both mentally and physically.
               For why is it, that, if the minds of Dewitt, Will and Chester, of Jule and
                  Belle—though perhaps not quite so expansive, so apt to receive and again dispense
                  knowledge as are the minds of their brothers and sisters, as John, Boyd, Maud, Ida
                  and Lucy—are in advance of the minds of their grandparents, yet are they also as
                  superior physically as were those immediate ancestors of theirs, there being with
                  them no lack of energy, or of enterprise, nor of the vital physical powers of the
                  body to endure?
               Why is this? Why is it? when you know that the most perfect physical development
                  abhors the touch of all confections, moral, intellectual and sensual;
                  abhors the very names of Restraint and Check in all
                  their forms; abhors the name of school-house more than any; and when I assure that
                  those superior characters experienced many of those terrors, and particularly the
                  last in its full force as affecting the physical person to undermine and prostrate
                  its powers;—at least their youth was spent in the school-room the same as are the
                  young years of other young people in this country.
               Shall it be answered that while their parents enjoined it upon them to carry a
                  book constantly in the pocket, as may be said, always ready for the brain to work
                  upon at all suitable times and seasons, they also taught them to
                     never neglect any suitable opportunity to play, to wrestle, to
                  run, to fight even, to defend their rights by the strong hand rather
                  than accept insult, to regard—no matter how lovely and desirable they may be—the
                  peaceful, sweet teachings of their worthy Quaker grandparents, or of the great
                  grand Student of mighty intellect,*
                   who, while engaged in his favorite pursuit of letters, necessarily and
                  from the nature of his thoughts and occupations, invariably inculcates gentleness
                  and peace at all times and seasons—shall it be answered that the Dimond parents
                  instructed their children that the lessons of peace and repose offered by the
                  student of mighty intellect, and in the precepts and life of the non-resisting
                  Quaker, if persisted in to their ultimate results, are most surely destructive of
                  the physical forces; if not always perceptibly in the individual immediately
                  concerned, certainly and inevitably in the long run, in the race.
               
                  *I have Eugene Lawrence particularly in my mind.
               
               Shall this be said of the Dimond parents, and that hence they taught their
                  offspring that sloth, all forms of repose are significantly symbolic of this
                  result—of Decay and Death; that though to sit or lie down may be absolutely
                  necessary to the recuperation of wearied physical powers, yet they were also
                  always to remember that when they sit down their attitude of repose proclaims that
                  they have tired; and if they tire they must needs be fallible, and that
                  fallibility is but another name for death; and that remembering and understanding
                  this their good sense should advise them to rise to their feet as soon as their
                  bodily powers are restored again to their natural healthy condition, and put death
                  still farther away by again seeking life in action.
               And again: Shall it be said that the Dimond parents taught their children that if
                  their or their country's rights should be
                  ever invaded by the strong hand of war they must understand that Providence
                  probably sent the warning as a needed incentive to action or exertion, either of
                  body or of mind, or perhaps both, and that consequently they should not accept and
                  bear the encroachments with Quaker-like submission in order to promote peace and
                  ease—should not make any ignoble compromise—germ of inaction and repose—seeds of
                  decay and death—but, strike the foe, and thus secure
                  vigor and Life in action, in strife, even if the blood, blue or red,
                  or both, should flow in streams in consequence.*

                     Friend, dare charge the Dimond parents with sin if such things be
                  true of them, as I aver?

               FIRST, APPLES AND CHESTNUTS; NEXT, WATER; THEN, LOVE.
               
                  I.
                  JOHN and the girls were ready to start.
                  "Tell Aunt Sarah and Aunt Ruth we shall come out in the winter."
                  "Yes, mother!"
                  "And when you come back be sure and get some purple silk in the city, for the
                     baby a dress; you know the shade."
                  "Yes! I know. No danger of my forgetting darling little Maudie."
                  "And, Bella! Remember you promised to get me some Date
                     Leaves."
                  "Yes, yes! Lu. You know I never forget. Come here, Lu."
                  The sweet child came and stood by her elder sister. Belle took her up in her
                     arms, looking at her pleasantly and affectionately. She kissed her fondly on
                     the forehead and both cheeks.
                  "Can Lu-lu help mother and Jule any while Ida and I are away?"
                  "Will they want such a little girl as I?"
                  "I guess so. Ask mother and see."
                  "Say, mother! mother! Can I do anything?"
                  "Yes, perhaps! I'll see when the girls are gone."
                  The girls said good-by to their mother and sisters, and went down to the
                     carriage where John and Will were waiting. The young men placed their sisters
                     in the carriage as politely as if they had been the loves of their hearts, got
                     in after them, and Will drove down to the station-house.
                  
                  The hard, heavy summer's work was done on the great farm, and now some of the
                     older children who had grown up to be men and women in the great, roomy, Dimond
                     farmhouse, were going to recreate for a time. The broad, fertile acres were
                     well tilled and productive, and the Dimonds could well afford a season of rest
                     and pleasure now and then. John and his two sisters, Belle and Ida, were going
                     to visit some of their uncles, aunts and cousins, who resided in a distant part
                     of the state.
                  They proceeded to the station-house on the railroad, caught the flying train,
                     and were soon whirling rapidly toward their destination.
                  And now, having got them safely started on their journey, the opportunity is
                     convenient, before proceeding further, to examine a little into the present
                     circumstances of the two young ladies who are to figure conspicuously in the
                     tale.
                  Belle Dimond is the oldest of five sisters. She is nineteen years old. There
                     are besides: Julia, who is sixteen; Ida, who sits with her back to the engine,
                     on the car seat facing her brother and sister, fifteen; Lucy, previously
                     introduced, nine; and the baby, Maud, an infant on all-fours.
                  Belle, though magnificent in many respects, is not what is styled a handsome
                     girl, though she be of a family nearly all whose members are blessed with
                     splendid physical forms, and countenances of more than ordinary strength and
                     beauty. Her form is as fine as Julia's is, and as Ida's will be; her hair,
                     though the gold in it is covered too heavily with shade to reflect the soulful
                     lights that are seen shimmering from theirs, is yet really richer than theirs;
                     but her countenance, though bearing a striking resemblance, is still very
                     different from theirs. It cannot be described as reflecting an inferior
                     intelligence, but you can perceive at a glance that her attractions of face are
                     not of the description which sets multitudes of men to raving. Her countenance
                     is expressively intelligent, speaking, and kindly. It is fair, clear, and pure;
                     but it has too much masculine strength in its lines, and her brow is a little
                     too wide and a little too low for her features to be ever styled beautiful, as
                     a woman's, unless by a lover.
                  Her countenance and eyes indicate, in fact, just what she is—a girl of the
                     superior order, of sound sense, of strong mind, of truthful and warm heart, and
                     fiery withal, if any one shall attempt to impose upon her. There is no nonsense
                     about her. She is a girl—a very woman—who can win any ordinary
                     man, but who will not, probably, ever herself accept any such. She will accept
                     old-maidism before she will wittingly throw herself away. She knows
                     herself—knows the needs of the womanly nature—and knows she wants a man as a
                        master.
                  She is of the sort of whom old maids are made down in Massachusetts—quite as
                     superfine, though perhaps a little more self-willed. She is one of those who
                     can, if she can find a husband to appreciate her excellences, fill his most
                     exalted ideal of female excellence and beauty supremely full; but again, one
                     who, rather than accept one who is an inferior, in any sense, would, like the
                     old maids aforementioned, prefer to allow a State to become peopled with Old
                     Bachelor Boys.
                  She can never rival the handsome sister who sits looking smilingly into her
                     happy face; she will be lucky if she conquers one genius; but if
                     she does subdue one, mind you, she will keep him. The power is in
                     her. If a man shall once learn and love her, no other beauty, of whatever sort,
                     can seduce him from her.
                  There is a rare, indescribable charm, or magnetism, discoverable in, now and
                     then, some choice female mind, warmed by the true heart, from which, when she
                     can once cast it about the soul of a true man and envelop that soul in its love
                     and warmth as in a mantle—there is such a magnetism peculiar to some rare
                     female natures from which there is no escape for the soul of the true man.
                  Belle, though unconscious to herself as yet, is endowed with this rare, lovely
                     charm. I fancy Aspasia and Cleopatra to have been thus blessed.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *Read my forthcoming sketch of Cleopatra in Famous Women of Other
                        Days, it you desire my estimate of the characters of those
                        celebrated females.
                  
                  And this Belle, singular—I was going to say singular as it may seem, but it is
                     not at all singular when her peculiar sterling worth is considered—has reached
                     the ripe age of nineteen without ever getting in love.
                  Unconsciously to herself she has now started out to meet her fate.
                  The cars sped along, and in due season arriving at the city of S—, our youthful
                     friends had traveled the extent of
                     their journey by rail. At S— they were to take stage the next
                     morning for their ultimate destination, a day's journey distant.
                  On stepping from the cars, John, therefore, entered a carriage with his sisters
                     for the Mansion House. Conducting the girls to one of the parlors, and
                     registering their arrival, he next visited the stage office, where he secured
                     seats in the stage-wagon for D— on the next day.
               
               
                  II.
                  The next morning, about ten o'clock, the lumbering old "go-cart" named a
                        stage, with its four horses attached, called for them. John and
                     his sisters were soon ready to leave their comfortable quarters in the hotel.
                     Descending the broad flight of steps in front of the "Mansion," and entering
                     the awaiting vehicle, they remarked at once that they were to have a
                     fellow-passenger.
                  They beheld seated inside the coach a young man who was apparently some
                     twenty-three or twenty-four years old. At the first glance their attention was
                     arrested, his appearance was so singular. It was so extremely and uncommonly
                     singular he might be called an anomaly among the members of the human family.
                     So thought Belle, and so thought Ida.
                  There did not appear to be any defect about him in particular. Nothing wrong
                     about head, bust or limbs, separately, as they could see. His bust and limbs
                     seemed to be perfect; his head was handsome, and his broad, high brow, and
                     open, rather round face, very pleasing and inviting. What was the matter,
                     then?
                  Simply, while all his parts, separately considered, seemed to denote health,
                     strength, intelligence, and perfect beauty in every particular, yet, taken
                     collectively, his frame was so broad and so massive for his height, and his
                     legs were so short and his arms so long in their proportions to the other
                     parts, that he appeared as a wonder.
                  He might have been—and not inappropriately—styled a twin brother to the "Little Giant," only that he was more of a marvel perhaps in
                     intellect as well as physical conformation. He was shorter, broader and
                     heavier, and perhaps, also, his mind carried heavier metal than the heavily
                     freighted mind of that eminent statesman.
                  As the party entered and seated themselves in the covered coach—a heavy Concord
                     Ark on two massive steel springs, and therefore so arranged that travelers must
                     sit two and two, facing in couples—this mass of broadness spoke pleasantly to
                     John, tendering the compliments of the day. John, a gentleman, readily
                     responding and taking a seat by the young man's side, after he had placed his
                     sisters to their satisfaction, they were soon enjoying an agreeable
                     conversation.
                  Belle, before entering the conveyance, had scrutinized his countenance
                     thoroughly, without appearing to do so, as only a woman can, and liked it; but
                     regarding his figure, though there seemed to be nothing lacking, she felt
                     sorrowful; she pitied him; she thought within herself:—
                  "No one can ever want such a looking man as that for a
                     friend."
                  The young are prone to allow their thoughts and their judgments to run to
                     extremes.
                  Still, Belle, listening attentively to the conversation which immediately
                     commenced between her brother and the young stranger, Solomon Ingoldsby—so he
                     had introduced himself—soon forgot her pity. She could not have done otherwise.
                     The talk was original, racy, picturesque, spirited; and she, being a girl of
                     quick and high intelligence, was soon deeply interested and pleased.
                  She became so absorbed that the occasional attempts made by Ida to institute an
                     independent line of conversation were responded to in monosyllables—and very
                     few of them.
                  She soon discovered that Ingoldsby was a genius, and that by nature he was
                     master of the intricacies and powers of ratiocination, but his syntax was
                     shocking bad. And the keen and well-educated girl also readily perceived he had
                     read but little, though he was possessed of considerable useful knowledge that
                     he had picked up in some way or other. She perceived that he had remembered all
                     he had ever heard, and that he was a natural logician, though not
                     versed in the syllogisms of Whately.
                  So much more was it to his credit that he could sustain himself so well. She
                     forgot his personal appearance for the time and admired his genius. Ingoldsby,
                     keen as she, though she had not spoken
                     a word, detected the happy impression he was making on her mind. His heart gave
                     one great bound—how hungry it was for woman's love; he had never before
                     interested a woman, unless, perhaps, his mother and sisters, and this one, he
                     began to divine from the flitting sympathetic lights passing over her
                     countenance as she listened attentively to the talk, might be superb—his heart
                     gave one great bound, and then throbbed calmly and equably on in consonance
                     with his self-contained, self-centered nature. After that he was as impassive
                     to himself as have been the Sphynxes these thousand years to the thousands of
                     Europeans who have toiled wearily through the yielding sands in which they are
                     buried, in the vain endeavor to read the solemn mysteries which lie concealed
                     behind their awful impenetrable faces. Such men as Ingoldsby seldom make
                     mistakes by opening their minds in advance of the proper time.
                  The state of affairs that the company tacitly, and as if naturally, fell into
                     as soon as they were seated in the coach and it had been started on the
                     journey, continued until near noon, John and Ingoldsby conversing with absorbed
                     interest, Belle eagerly listening, and Ida apprehending all that was said as
                     well as anybody could, but unable to divest her mind of another train of
                     thought, very amusing to her, regarding their fellow-traveler's personal
                     appearance. She was yet quite young, and therefore unthinking in some respects.
                     The ludicrous, of almost any sort, possessed a peculiar charm for her gay young
                     heart, and could easily predominate over those emotions which sympathize with
                     misfortune, especially if the misfortune be a little retired or be not actually
                     knocking at the doors of the heart for condolence. Ida could hardly school her
                     countenance from betraying her thoughts; but she did; more of that, however,
                     hereafter.
                  About noon, the conversation taking a sudden change—as conversations sometimes
                     will, for no apparent good reason—John and his sisters learned that like most
                     young men of his neighborhood, young Ingoldsby had been out to the city of S—to
                     purchase his supply of winter clothing—that the young men and boys, by going to
                     S—, could save more than enough in the operation of buying to pay the expenses
                     of the journey, and also get a chance to see and explore some of the wonders of
                     the city besides.
                  They also learned that the young man's home was, and had been for the last
                     fifteen years, in the actual pine and hemlock forests about twenty miles beyond
                     D—, and that he was now in the employ of their uncle Bennett as a
                     farm-laborer.
                  When this piece of information came out, John of course presented Mr. Ingoldsby
                     to his sisters. He had begun to like the young man, he had no scruples with
                     regard to his being only a common farm-hand, so long as he believed him to be a
                        man, and besides, he knew that the customs of the district they
                     were about to visit would require it; they were not in the vicinity of New York
                     or Boston.
                  The young ladies had scarcely acknowledged the introduction when the stage drew
                     up at the stopping place for refreshments.
                  So soon as they had alighted the young stranger asked the pleasure of
                     accompanying Miss Dimond in to dinner.
                  There were now some thoughts traveled through Belle's mind more rapidly than
                     ever before. She felt queerly. The beauty and force of his thoughts were not
                     now appealing—irresistibly appealing—for approval. She was from under the
                     delightful spell; her mind had now returned to his appearance; and she now for
                     the first time saw the full awkwardness of his disproportions as she for the
                     first time saw him standing on his feet, and the awkwardness so far exceeded
                     what she had imagined as she had seen him sitting, that it shocked her; his
                     legs were, indeed, very short, his arms quite long, and his body plenty
                     wide.
                  For an instant she hesitated to accept the proffered escort. How her elegant
                     person would appear walking by the side of such an ungainly mass of humanity!
                     Again she pitied him, and more deeply than at first sight; but, also, she
                        wanted to run away.
                  But she was just, generous, brave, and a girl of principle. She
                     lashed herself sharply. For only seven seconds, during which she shook and
                     smoothed her plumes, just as any woman would, to make herself presentable to
                     walk into the house, did she hesitate. He did not suspect her if his head was
                     full of wit.
                  At the end of the seven seconds she gave her hand with a kind smile, looking
                     down at the broad, square figure at her side—she was two inches the tallest—and
                     walked serenely into the hotel by his
                     side, but with her heart crying out against the necessity.
                  
                     What a creature a woman is!
                  
                  John and the younger sister followed in their wake.
                  Ida, looking at the sturdy breadth advancing solidly by the side of the trim,
                     slim, and rather tall Belle, turned her face up to John's and smiled a smile of
                     inimitable roguishness. John had remarked the apparent entire unfitness of the
                     two figures so widely dissimilar being united together, even for a dinner hour,
                     though he had not allowed the circumstance to disturb his equanimity with its
                     sense of the ludicrous. He was too old and too wise for that.
                  But his sympathy with the frolicsome spirit of youth did ask him to respond to
                     the young girl's lively appeal for appreciation and support; nevertheless, a
                     decent regard for appearances, and for human dignity, caused him to repress the
                     desire to answer her call. He bit his lip and shook his head.
                  Ida had an immense respect for John, and had he succeeded in concealing from
                     her, just at the time, his sympathy with her youthful desire for play, things
                     might have been very different afterwards. But, as it was, her quick wit
                     subtilely and easily penetrated his thought, divining that his heart supported
                     her. I suspect this had a great influence while she was framing and pointing
                     some remarkable speeches made by her in the course of the afternoon and during
                     the next two weeks.
                  At present, however, Ida and John followed the other more conspicuous couple
                     into the dining-hall, where the company dined, young Ingoldsby acquitting
                     himself excellently well in spite of his bad grammar and his wide personal
                     dimensions. And, as in the coach, Belle frequently caught herself listening
                     with almost fascinated attention to the free, bold speech with which he graced
                     his equally free, bold, original thoughts; and always when she recovered
                     herself, wishing that his figure could have been proportioned a little more
                     like other folks.
                  Why, she couldn't have told. She had never subjected her heart to any mental
                     analysis, and could not have explained concerning the emotions and sympathies
                     in all their phases and bearings; nor had she yet experienced the one grand
                     passion—that passion which is of such deep significance to the female heart—and
                     could not, therefore, refer all the emotions of the heart to their proper
                     sources. But she did know that her heart did not care particularly about him,
                     and didn't suppose that it ever would. In fact, that thought had not yet
                     troubled her at all.
                  Ah, Belle! it was with opportunity that the versatile mind and the
                     silver tongue of the black Othello won the heart—the very soul—of the lovely,
                     white-skinned Desdemona, daughter of a Senator.
                  We shall see.
                  Rising from the dinner table, Ida found just one opportunity when the attention
                     of the men was attracted elsewhere, while they were proceeding to the coach, to
                     relieve her breast of some of the ethers of mischief which were swelling it
                     almost to bursting. She improved it. Putting her arm around her sister's waist,
                     and her mouth to her ear, she whispered with solemn gravity, but with a whole
                     comedy of fun scintillating from her handsome eyes:
                  "Four feet five inches, by five feet four inches."
                  Belle gave the mischievous girl such a look of reproof as she had never
                     received. It almost startled her from her stability. But it did not subdue her;
                     as subsequent events will instruct the reader.
                  That afternoon, Belle and Solomon Ingoldsby conversed much together as they sat
                     facing one another in the coach; and as in the forenoon, and at dinner, his
                     powers of mind to interest seemed to be increasingly marvelous. More than once
                     she was compelled to exercise strong will to awaken herself from the spell
                     which his eloquence cast about her, so that she might reply to his address with
                     propriety; and when she had roused herself from the trance imposed, and had
                     properly responded, then would she again feel sorry for him, and wonder why it
                     was that such an agreeable countenance and such abilities should be upheld by
                     such an ungainly frame.
                  Often, that afternoon, she pitied him; and pity, they say, is akin to love. But
                     that isn't true, always. Belle, though those very emotions and principles were
                     being appealed to which forecast love in such hearts as hers, was very far from
                     love in her present state of mind. And she would have known it if she had
                     thought about it at all. She would not have feared for herself. Though
                     everything seemed to be courting her
                     sympathies and inclinations in this man's favor, there was yet one great
                     overshadowing, overwhelming thought which repressed and checked everything that
                     had a tendency to love while yet it was in incipiency. That thought was
                        pity itself.
                  Such women as Belle Dimond never love the men they pity, while
                     they pity. I can tell you. I know. I have marked more than one case.
                  Belle somehow thought that this man's lot in the world must be
                        always to receive pity, often ridicule, and sometimes, perhaps,
                     contempt; and she would have known had she explored her heart and asked
                     herself, that she could never love a man whom she must shield. Love might
                     continue if it should precede, but to follow misfortune, never.
                  Belle was one of those women who, true to natural instincts as well as to
                     revealed truths, and who are perfectly competent to take care of themselves,
                     will never love and give themselves except to those who are perfectly competent
                     to take care of them—to those who have respect as well as deserve
                     it, in every sense, morally, intellectually and physically, so far as courage
                     is concerned; they may overlook incongruities, but abhor—no, not
                     abhor, but commiserate—natural deficiencies, and despise
                     inefficiencies, if they deem them remediable.
                  They are the really strong-minded women of this earth. Their minds are so broad
                     and so large they are willing and anxious their husbands shall rule as lords.
                     And, if you have remarked it, one of their number rarely accepts a husband who
                     will ever use his strength and power to tyrannize over his wife.
                  While, almost unconsciously to herself, Belle was learning such ideas as the
                     preceding for the first time—learning, only that she would remember, and
                     arrange them in her mind in the future; and while young Ingoldsby was getting
                     inside of that mind and learning to admire and respect it very much—he cared
                     much less for mere physical beauty than most men—he had scarce looked at the
                     handsome Ida—they were getting on toward their destination.
                  They were now toward the end of their day's ride, where occurred two or three
                     long, heavy, fatiguing hills. Wearied by the long ride, the young men alighted
                     at this stage of the journey to exercise themselves and relieve the weary
                     horses by walking the remaining distance to Mr. Bennett's.
                  They had scarce stepped forth, and the coach was again rumbling on, when the
                     irrepressible younger girl, who, as has been said, was just at the proper age
                     for mischief, and who had scarce been enabled to repress her gathering and
                     swelling emotions of fun and of liveliness until now, opened her battery.
                  She broke forth, in defiance of her mother's remembered instructions, and just
                     as if on the play-ground with her companions at the old district school-house,
                     exclaiming:
                  "He's struck! He's struck! O, I can see! He's talked with you more than half
                     the afternoon; and how eager!"
                  "Stop!" said Belle, quietly and decisively.
                  Ida's sparkling, laughing eyes, were full of mirth and mischief. Nothing at the
                     time could have prevented her relieving herself. She didn't know then; she
                     meant no harm; though two weeks later nothing could have induced her to repeat
                     what follows:
                  "What a time you can have! You can roll his feet up to his head and tie them
                     there, and put him into a basket like a dumpling in a kettle."
                  "Ida! you know better than to disgrace yourself so."
                  Belle's eyes began to flame anger, though her voice was quiet as before.
                  "And carry him round to show to your friends!"
                  "Stop talking, or I will stop the coach and you shall get out."
                  "It will be better than Barnum's; he hasn't so rare a curiosity in his shop,"
                     persisted the infatuated girl.
                  The mine of mischievous mirth playing wantonly as in a congenial
                     pleasure-ground in the younger girl's beautiful face and eyes might have
                     disturbed the serenity of the seven wise men of Greece, had they been under its
                     influence, but the well ordered mind of the girl of nineteen could not be
                     affected by its fanciful suggestions, in such a connection. Her principles and
                     stability of character, as well as her sex, forbade the possibility.
                  She was very angry now; but her tones rang out still cool, if clear and
                     sharp:
                  "Driver!"
                  Ida sprang up and threw her arms around her sister's neck.
                  "O, don't, don't, Bella! please don't! What will they think to see me out there
                     alone? If you could only know how you
                     two appeared when you went in to dinner together you wouldn't blame me!"
                  The coach ceased rumbling and came to a halt.
                  "My sister and I will alight and walk to the top of the hill that is before
                     us," said Belle.
                  The driver clambered down from his perch and assisted them to alight. The two
                     men, a little in advance, waited for them to come up, and the four,
                     entertaining themselves with their tongues, as usual, on the way, walked to the
                     top of the hill in company.
                  There the girls re-entered the coach, Ida controlling her mirth, though it
                     still danced merrily in her eyes, eager to leap into freedom at the first
                     opportunity. She denied herself bravely.
                  But she had not long to restrain herself; for, the coach soon after stopping at
                     the door of their Uncle Bennett's house, the interesting events of the
                     afternoon were soon forgotten in the warm welcome given by their relatives.
               
               
                  III.
                  Belle's visit to her uncle's in D— was to her the commencement of a new and
                     wonderful existence.
                  The evening of her arrival she saw her Cousin Julius for the first time. He was
                     about twenty years old. He came from the fields, where he had been at work
                     alone, just before sunset. Though coming in from his labor, dressed in ordinary
                     coarse cloth, Belle saw that the plain garments he wore could not derogate from
                     a certain air of pride, self-assertion, and superiority native to him.
                  He came smiling up to where his mother, sister Sophia, and Belle were standing,
                     chatting, on the lawn in front of the house, flinging his dirty chip-hat on to
                     a convenient rose bush with a careless, easy grace as he strode along toward
                     them on the soft, short grass.
                  His mother introduced him directly, saying fondly and proudly:
                  "This is cousin Julius, Belle!"
                  Belle looked up into an open, self-possessed, laughing, boyish, not
                     particularly strong countenance, the crown of which was an ordinary forehead,
                     though fair and white, and set underneath with two sparkling, vivacious, hazel
                     eyes; the whole ensemble completed and capped by an overflowing luxuriance of
                     dark brown hair.
                  She commented mentally as she reviewed his fine proportions and quite
                     presentable appearance:
                  "He is not a Dimond. He appears as well, physically, as the Dimonds; he is as
                     free, open, and bold, but otherwise he does not look firm and strong enough.
                     His countenance lacks masculine character. He is a Bennett. But, the Bennett's
                     are smarter than most folks. I think I shall like him. Tall, handsome
                     Julius!"
                  Handsome Julius flung an arm carelessly around the girl's waist, kissed her,
                     and immediately drew her away from his mother and sister. He had looked into
                     her eyes, had felt the magnetic power of her peculiar personality, and wanted
                     her to himself. Before either had spoken, he had commented to himself with a
                     sense of the highest satisfaction:
                  "How nice she is!"
                  Belle was not used to having male arms flung around her waist so familiarly,
                     and did not half like it; but remembering the relationship she suffered it to
                     remain for the moment. And after a little, being a girl whose soul went into
                     her conversation, she forgot it was there, and walked in the embrace as
                     unthinkingly as if it were her sister Julia with whom she conversed, or any
                     other girl whom she particularly liked.
                  Julius' arm enjoyed its usurpation for nearly half an hour while they were
                     walking around the lawn and getting to be very pleasant friends, indeed. Then
                     they went into the house to sit by the lamplight where the others had preceded
                     them, meeting Ida and her cousin, Edna Bennett, of the same age, entering from
                     the back way, and just returned from a visit to the orchard.
                  Ida's beauty, though not yet matured, was of so superior an order that Julius
                     was immediately and strongly impressed in its powers, and had he not already
                     yielded to the magnetism of Belle's mind and manner it is probable he would
                     soon have thought of her as his liege, and thus have escaped a bitter
                     humiliation with which Belle subsequently and unavoidably rewarded his
                     devotion.
                  As it was, the subtle charms of Belle's goodness, refinement, wit, the happiest
                     of faculties to interest and please—
                     an assemblage of the most superior and choicest of female mental powers,
                     already held him chained.
                  So much for meeting first, for the first time, a woman twenty minutes before
                     you do her sister who is equally intelligent, and on whom heaven has lavished a
                     greater wealth of physical charms.
                  It is of considerable consequence to boys like Julius, which girl is first
                     met.
                  After the meeting with Ida the evening passed pleasantly away, as evenings
                     usually do between relatives who are met together to enjoy themselves. Solomon
                     Ingoldsby sat with the family, joined in the conversation, and appeared to
                     enjoy the evening as well as any. Belle's pity for him kept every faculty awake
                     and alert, but she could not discover that any of her relatives regarded him as
                     different from other people. They did not. He had been with them so long and
                     they had become so familiar with his personal appearance that it was but seldom
                     they remembered he was not as elegant a physical specimen of masculinity as any
                     one of the masculine Bennetts or Dimonds.
                  It was only Ida who appeared to have become suddenly filled with an
                     extraordinary, and unusual to her, desire to "make fun" at the expense of his
                     singular appearance. But the irrepressible girl was sharp, and so framed her
                     speech, at least on that evening, that none but John and the elder sister
                     suspected a covert meaning.
                  Once, however, when the evening was about half spent, an opportunity arising
                     that was too tempting to lose without improvement, she committed herself in a
                     manner that compelled Belle to give the matter her attention.
                  Solomon arose to leave the room. Passing through the doorway, both Belle and
                     Ida who happened to be sitting side by side just then, and to be so seated as
                     to have full command of the passage of egress with their eyes, noticed that his
                     square proportions filled the entire width.
                  At the instant when drawing attention to the circumstance would be most
                     effective, Ida turned her speaking, expressive face to Belle, whispering pretty
                     loudly—she intended more than one should hear:
                  
                     "Four feet five inches, by five feet four inches!"
                  
                  The circumspect Belle gave the offending girl a look, then, that she never
                     forgot. She did not attempt any more jokes at Solomon's expense until the next
                     day.
                  Her cousin Sophia, sitting on the other side of the elder sister, overheard the
                     remark. She looked across angrily at Ida; then glanced inquiringly to Belle.
                     Belle responded to the look in low tones:
                  "Please don't notice her, Sophia. Her present conduct is alien to both her
                     disposition and her principles. She will do differently when she sees."
                  Sophia good-naturedly nodded, and respected the request.
                  After the evening of the visitors' arrival in D—, the warm, dreamy, hazy days
                     of the Fall passed on in even procession very pleasantly to all, and
                     particularly so to Belle. Julius, kind, attentive, overflowing with happy
                     thoughts, with animation, spirit, and life, she got to liking very, very much.
                     She did not love him; she knew, and learned it more and more every day, that he
                     was much below her standard of masculine excellence; still, he was very
                     agreeable company; the most agreeable male society she had ever enjoyed,
                     unless, perhaps, at some times when she conversed with Solomon forgetful of his
                     appearance.
                  And Julius, she perceived was growing fond of her, fonder and more fond every
                     day. And she, perceiving, and not tiring, had commenced to think what
                        possibly might be.
                  She had not yet said to herself—she didn't know as she ever would say to
                     herself—"I will accept him when he asks," but she had imagined how pleasant it
                     might be if they could always be together and always like one another as well
                     as now.
                  Meantime, don't think that the interest that Solomon had inspired had commenced
                     to wane. It had not. If anything different, it was growing, it was on the
                     increase.
                  Nor should you imagine that if Solomon was struggling quietly, secretly,
                     persistently, and manfully, to secure the place he had marked for his own
                     before they were three days old in one another's acquaintance, if he could win
                     it, that he had yet made any such impression that Belle indulged any such happy
                     thoughts about him as she did about Julius, for he had not.
                  She had not thought of him as a possible lover. If any one, her aunt for
                     instance, or mother, privileged to propound the question, remarking the kind
                     and absorbed attention she gave when enjoying his society, had asked her if she
                     would ever marry him, she would have answered surprisedly but readily, "No!" And
                     that answer would have been the utter truth of her heart.
                  Julius did remark to himself the deference she paid to the genius of Solomon,
                     and mistaking it for something else, he was proportionally jealous and afraid;
                     being however, boy though he was, yet wiser than many, he held his peace, not
                     molesting her happiness nor endangering his own cause.
                  But Belle, studying herself as the days progressed, came to know of herself
                     that Solomon was a fascinating study to her mind, without her heart ever
                     getting any inclination towards him. She came to know that, mentally, he was
                     just the man to get her affections, but supposed and believed his uncouth
                     personal dimensions would always effectually bar her heart against his
                     entrance. Fearless, therefore, she accepted and took him in as a friend. And
                     having taken him in she studied him with unembarrassed fearlessness
                     thereafter.
                  At the little evening parties gotten up in the vicinity for the visitors'
                     entertainment, Solomon received invitations with the rest. He always attended,
                     and Belle observing that no one appeared to think of him in any way different
                     from others, unless it were that his fine conversational powers secured more
                     than his share of attention in that respect, the pity her heart had indulged
                     for him began to depart.
                  This left her mind entirely unembarrassed to study, and she studied yet the
                     more fearlessly and faithfully. She soon learned that no laugh or jest at his
                     expense could disturb his repose of manner. He was self-poised. He had soon
                     fathomed the spirit of Ida's mocking, but traveled serenely on his way
                     regardless of the shafts she shot at him. Belle learned it.
                  Even the frolicsome girl burlesquing his syntax in such a manner as only a
                     keen, clear-headed, witty girl can, so that she cannot be caught and brought to
                     account for her misdeeds, could never provoke or anger him. Solomon would
                     invariably smile at such times, almost imperceptibly, as if thanking her for a
                     kindness, but otherwise gave no sign; and Belle was sure to perceive with her
                     good memory, her fine reason, and her quick intuitions that he never fell into
                     the same error a second time after the pitiless one had instructed him.
                  He seemed to see, and hear, and remember everything. Nothing escaped him; and
                     he made no parade. Belle learned it while she studied. And she learned too,
                     from conversations he had with her uncle and John—Julius was a nullity when
                        they talked—and to which she gave her attention, that they
                     could introduce no subject too abstruse for his intellect; and very often he
                     would go beyond them and disinter truths that one of them at least had never
                     suspected as lying within the embrace of their theme.
                  Of course they often introduced words, and terms, of whose significance he was
                     ignorant; and of course when they did so he would quietly ask for definitions,
                     getting which, his powers of reasoning, seemingly limitless, would speedily
                     accomplish the rest.
                  And yet again of course, all the girl learned did but exalt the man the more in
                     her estimation. Dangerous ground to walk upon, for a girl who wishes to
                     continue mistress of her own heart in the connection.
                  Nearly two weeks of this interesting life passed, during which Belle learned
                     that, what with the unconscious Ida for grammar, John as Lexicon, and all of
                     them as an intellectual bank on which to draw, Solomon Ingoldsby was
                     progressing amazingly. She began to discover and to question if he might not be
                     a young god in his serenity and profundity of mind. She learned to respect his
                     repose, his goodness and his strength of mental powers, and was all prepared to
                     love him, if only that form could have been a little more inviting; yet, though
                     all prepared, the thought of love for Solomon Ingoldsby had never yet entered
                     into Belle Dimond's heart.
                  She did not love him, except with the intellect. Her heart had
                     never given the remotest throb of delight at his approach. She would not have
                     mourned had he married another woman on the instant. On the contrary, his
                     peculiar personal presence was, unconsciously to herself, driving her to force
                     the sexual sympathies natural to her age toward her cousin Julius. (A little
                     later a great fear compelled her to wittingly persevere, for a short season, in
                     the same course.) And, deeming Julius worthy, she was learning to like his
                     companionship better and better as the time progressed, though she had quietly
                     and decisively put his arm from about her person since the first evening.
                  
                  For nearly two weeks she and Julius, John and their other cousins, talked,
                     rambled and played together, happy and joyous, blithesomely ranging the fields,
                     the woods, and the orchard, where the apple picking was going on. Nearly two
                     weeks, during which Belle had placed Solomon on a very lofty pedestal, and had
                     almost commenced to encourage Julius.
                  Nearly two weeks of the loveliest of Indian Summer weather.
                  
                     Then commenced the beginning of the end.
                  During those two weeks, the girls, and particularly Belle and Sophia,
                     occasionally went into the orchard of an afternoon to witness the operation of
                     picking apples, and I suppose also to chat with the young men. One afternoon,
                     near the close, those two were perched, each on the end of a barrel, chatting
                     together and throwing an occasional choice word to Solomon and Julius, who were
                     stripping the last tree of its burden of fine fruit in company.
                  John and the other girls were at the other uncle's, and Julius was working for
                     half a day, as he had done now and then during the visit.
                  The young men had commenced their picking operation, side by side, where the
                     girls were now sitting, on the east side of the tree, and had progressed until
                     Julius was on the north, and Solomon on the south side. Suddenly, while the
                     happy girls were busy with their sociable talk, there came an inviting call
                     simultaneously from either direction.
                  "Here, Bella!" "Here, Belle!"
                  Belle raised her eyes up to the apple pickers. Each held an apple in his hand,
                     poised, ready to toss.
                  "Yes!" said she, and she held her hands in readiness to raise them aloft. The
                     men threw their apples together. One she caught in her right hand, the other in
                     her left. She had played ball to some purpose when a younger girl, though ball
                     playing was not then a girl's pastime.
                  Belle scanned her fruit. The apple in her right hand, coming from Julius, was
                     curiously marked with a light colored spot about three-fourths of an inch
                     across, set in the dark green of its coat. The spot was perfectly the shape of
                     a diamond. The apple, while growing, resting against a knot on the limb of the
                     tree, the face of which was of that shape, its weight, together with the
                     exclusion of light, had made the impression.
                  Her curiosity now excited, she quickly turned the apple in the other hand; the
                     warm, crimson blush brought out on its smooth, round cheek by the warm sunlight
                     was a perfect heart. Solomon was silent; Julius called:
                  "Isn't it curious, Bella?"
                  Mechanically, the girl answered "Yes!"—no more. She was musing, and preferred
                     at the moment not to invite further remarks. She had been informed of enough of
                     the mysteries and fascinations of card-playing to awaken her interest, so that
                     now, seeing the pictured symbols of the two suits, she instantly queried with
                     herself:
                  "Hearts and diamonds! Which is trumps, I wonder?"
                  Then, instantly, her face crimsoned, as the quick, following thought of the
                     implication she had made, entered her sincere mind. Almost unwittingly she had
                     made an inquisition that implied what she had never yet admitted to herself as
                     possible, namely, that if hearts should prove to be trumps, she might yet
                     accept the short, wide figure of Solomon Ingoldsby as her lover.
                  She put the unwelcome thought away instantly; it pained her; she could not, nor
                     would she, accept it. But presently, not heeding her volition, it came back
                     again.
                  Why should those two apples, bearing those peculiar devices, have been
                     discovered, picked and tossed to her so simultaneously, and by those two men of
                     all others? Did it mean anything? The heart and the diamond! She had heard of
                     such phenomena in nature—coincidences with, and apparently shadowing forth and
                     explaining events that should transpire in the future. Was there any such
                     thing? Were there mysterious Providences that made themselves tangible to human
                     reason in this manner? Was this such a Providence? Could it be that this was
                     God addressing himself to her?
                  She revolved the idea rapidly in her quick mind—revolved it, striving to unlock
                     its close secrets. She revolved it, until, struck with awe at its elusive
                     mysteries, she acknowledged it too great for human reason to compass. Silently
                     then, she asked God for help, and in answer as it seemed, after a time, from
                     away down in some secret, unfathomed recess of her consciousness, there came a
                     whisper which seemed to say—to say very softly, scarce to be heard, indeed, but with immense potence inhering
                     in its still, resistless force:
                  "You will love and marry one of those two young men."
                  With woman's implicit faith in the inscrutable immutability of the
                     Unfathomable, she accepted the mysterious insistence at once, as a command; she
                     believed it, but she said to herself, as if she were yet to some extent a free
                     agent, and yet had a choice:
                  "It must be Julius. It shall be Julius. I do like Julius!"
                  Then she thought of Solomon, closing her thought with "four feet five and five
                     feet four," and shut her heart up close, declaring emphatically:
                  "I must not, I will not think in that way again!"
                  Again Julius recurred to her willing mind, and again she repeated with quite a
                     thrill of joy, a pleasant laugh rippling over her virgin heart:
                  "Handsome Julius! Bonnie Julius!"
                  She had called up Caroline Helstone in "Shirley," of whom she had but lately
                     been reading. Would that sweet creation of Miss Bronte's sweet imagination
                     assist her any? Judge, when I repeat to you that she did not yet love either of
                     these young men standing on their ladders before her; that her heart was yet
                     perfectly her own, and she knew it; but, that she put the two
                     apples together into the same pocket. And that, once more, now, the thought of
                     Solomon paid its intrusive visit. Like the spirits in Manfred, it had begun to
                     come unbidden. It would not stay away. Its persistence in staying by her began
                     to distress her and make her feel afraid. It alarmed her to flee, and yet she
                     was a brave girl.
                  She spoke to Sophia:
                  "I must go to the house."
               
               
                  IV.
                  They all went to a lecture at the school-house in the evening. After the
                     lecture Julius walked home with Belle. She felt quite happy in his company. She
                     had resolved, if he should propose and hit just right, she would accept him;
                     and with her a decision made happiness in a fair degree.
                  But though Julius loved the girl most deeply, he did not propose. He was too
                     true to his instincts. There was that all-pervading, indescribable
                     something—fine and shadowy as the breath of man in the sunlight in this
                     instance, yet still there, and felt—always existing in the manner of a true
                     woman when she does not love, which warned him to keep silent. He dared not,
                     and did not give voice to his yearnings—it was yearnings in his
                     breast; had he been a man, his love would have been a thorough inspiration.
                     Yet, if he had only known the thoughts excited in her mind by the apples—how
                     hard she was trying to teach herself to think of him in the kindest manner—not
                     because her heart accepted him, nor yet because her judgment approved
                     entirely—she knew so well there were men so much more gifted, and who could
                     speak to her soul in language that could set it to so much more completely
                     tuneful harmony and happiness than he possibly could—but because, since the
                     episode of the apples, she had been haunted, harassingly haunted by a half fear
                     that if hard pressed she should yet love "four feet five by five feet four,"
                     and as yet, she wanted to escape that fate.
                  That evening she would have thanked Julius could he have mastered the situation
                     with delicacy and circumspection, and have assisted her to raise an effectual
                     bar between herself and the fate that she dimly saw approaching in the
                     distance.
                  But Julius not knowing, his golden opportunity slipped beyond his control,
                     unimproved. He parted with Belle that night, and went up to his room and went
                     to bed, not knowing how near he had been to getting, but had lost, the great
                     blessing that he would have died to obtain.
                  The next morning, at the breakfast-table, the lecture of the evening before
                     naturally came up for discussion.
                  It was concerning one of those humanitarian questions, seized upon, and
                     skillfully and happily handled by the needy adventurer in a manner to fleece
                     the people of the rural districts and replenish his own pockets.
                  The company at the table, comprised mostly of young, careless heads, but many
                     of them old enough to speak for themselves, were soon in a jangle. One
                     remembered a point as having been turned in one way, another in another,
                     etc.
                  Discord seemed about to rule. Mr. Bennett spoke:
                  
                  "Come, Sol! you'll have to straighten things out as usual!"
                  Sol, accepting the invitation very readily, commenced and gave a thorough
                     synopsis of the lecture with his simple words and easy flowing style, noting
                     where, at two or three stages in its course, the speaker had wandered from his
                     line of argument and had not returned again, and concluding with saying the
                     lecture wasn't worth the waste of so much breath.
                  When he had ceased speaking, two or three of the youngsters exclaimed eagerly
                     together:
                  "How well Sol does remember, and how slick he can tell anything."
                  Said Sophia:
                  "I didn't know the lecturer wandered from his subject, but I can see it easy
                     enough now Sol has told us."
                  "And so can I! and I! and I!" quickly chimed a chorus of youthful voices.
                  There were, in fact, but five persons among the fourteen seated at the long
                     table, who had discovered, before being informed by Sol, that the speaker of
                     the previous evening wasn't quite compos
                        mentis. Five to discover and remember in a company of fourteen, is
                     a pretty fair proportion, to be sure; but then, three of the five were
                     Dimonds.
                  Though the conversation was lively and general, Ida had as yet said nothing.
                     Her brain however was busy, and Belle knew from the experience of the past two
                     weeks that something must soon come from her expressive silence. And something
                     did come of it as the expectant sister anticipated.
                  Immediately, when the youthful voices were a little stilled, and she could
                     launch her thought effectively, she electrified the table by exclaiming with
                     great pomposity:
                  "Sol thinks he's going to Congress!"
                  Belle threw the aggressive girl a warning look, meant to be quieting.
                  No one seemed inclined to speak for the moment.
                  Sol gazed for half a minute steadily, searchingly, and with profound respect,
                     into the charming young face; he had not thought her half so "deep," and he cared nothing for the mock.
                  He knew they all knew he aspired, but none had found his most secret thought
                     but she. The clear-headed Belle, making him a study, as she had, had not
                     penetrated so far. She instantly went up in his esteem almost by the side of
                     Belle, and had not that young lady had exclusive possession of his mind, he
                     might have been seeking to touch her hand.
                  But she never would have permitted it, Solomon. Never! She would never have
                     walked in to dinner by your side. Rather, she would have braved a thousand
                     scenes. Most, most lucky for you was it, that your large heart was
                     first attracted by the more staid elder sister—the sister who held the
                     conventional proprieties in greater esteem.
                  As it was, Solomon's thoughts returned directly to the liege, where they had
                     been staying much latterly, while he replied with grave dignity to the willful
                     Ida's promulgation of his secret:
                  "I think I may."
                  "No!" said Mr. Bennett, quickly. "You will hardly get
                        there, Sol. You have rived shingles and sawed lumber too long
                     out there in the woods. Your education is not good enough. And you are now,
                     with no means, too old to think of academy or college."
                  "I think I may," re-affirmed Sol, with even, weighty tones. "I have heard John
                     Van Buren and Anson Burlingame speak, and in time, I am sure I shall beat both.
                     They explain themselves very well, but you can readily perceive they care more
                     for the good-will of their audience, than to explain their subject. They use a
                     subject mainly to invite popularity. I should talk only to explain the truth
                     and make it weigh; and truth, if you stick to it, will, I believe, outweigh
                     anything else under the sun in time."
                  "Why, Sol!" persisted Mr. Bennett, in an astonished tone, "you cannot even
                     spell the words 'explain' and 'weigh.'"
                  "May be I'll get a wife who'll teach me. I'm quick to learn."
                  He spoke the weighty sentence in his ordinary tone of voice; as though he had
                     never thought of any one particularly. His features, look, and tone of voice
                     were just as always. Without stopping to inquire if he were to be thanked,
                     Belle thanked Solomon in her heart that he had not betrayed by word or sign
                     that she was in his thoughts. She felt grateful that he was a gentleman.
                  He had not implicated her. No one suspected she was in his thoughts, and had
                     been there for the few days past—no
                     one but Julius. The lover is always lynx-eyed and can seldom be cheated.
                  But nevertheless, the declaration brought some fruit, and as usual, the fruit
                     came from Ida.
                  Ida, since the day in the stage-coach, had thought no more about Solomon's
                     being smitten with Belle's charms; she had not suspected that his early
                     admiration might be grown into love—so secret had he been since that first day.
                     Sharp as she had been to waylay his ambition, she had not explored his
                     affections; and so, as she was innocent in that respect, she could only be
                     chargeable with youth, and a love of mischief, when she responded half
                     tauntingly to his dearest hope:
                  
                  "I guess you can get Bella!"
                  Some of the company smiled in sympathy with the girl's evident desire to make
                     "fun" at his expense, and to humble the aspirations of the man of
                        genius: all were surprised.
                  Belle rose quickly from her chair and spoke to her aunt:
                  "Aunt Sarah, please excuse me?"
                  Mrs. Bennett inclined her head.
                  Belle next directing her attention to the offending girl, spoke a single word
                     impressively and imperiously: "Come!" and stepped from the
                     breakfast-room into the great hall that ran through the center of the
                     house.
                  Ida dared not disobey and make a scene before so many; nor would she if she had
                     dared, for she loved her elder sister, and was accustomed to obey her. She
                     arose at once, and followed her out into the hall.
                  The monitress closed the door and led the wayward offender to a little distance
                     down the hall, she following with her bright young head erect, and with the
                     step of a princess. Belle appealed, deep distress in her voice and face:
                  "Ida! what is the matter with you? You never were guilty of such improper
                     conduct before this visit!"
                  Ida did feel sorry that she had grieved her sister so deeply. She knew she had
                     spoken very improperly at the table, yet she allowed whole volcanoes of
                     laughter to shimmer out from the caverns of her handsome eyes, as she answered,
                     with self-satisfied complacency:
                  "I don't know, Bella! The sight of Sol seems to invite me to hit him. But
                     still, that isn't it. I don't know what it is. But I guess it's because I'm
                     changing from a girl into a woman. Hadn't you better paste a card on my back,
                     and send me home to mother?"
                  
                     Changing from a girl to a woman!
                  
                  This was too much. Deeply mortified and angry as Belle was, the girl's
                     inimitable wit effected a sudden and complete revolution in her emotions. Ida
                     conquered that time. Belle turned her back to her sister, stepped two or three
                     steps away, and held her hand hard over her mouth, literally choking down a
                     paroxysm of laughter. Her distress was driven away.
                  When she had conquered herself, she again turned about, saying:
                  "You may come back to the table, Ida."
                  When the sisters re-entered the breakfast room, the others were discussing—chestnuts. The beautiful, dreamy weather of the past two or three
                     weeks had latterly settled into three or four of the clearest, purest days
                     imaginable—days peculiarly American—the bright mornings being introduced with
                     sharp frosts. The frosts, the company at the table soon decided, had been
                     sufficiently severe to open the burr of the chestnut so that the nut itself
                     might be easily dislodged. The younger boys, Manuel and Samuel—indisputable
                     authority in such matters—declared such to be the fact.
                  So the girls arranged that, after dinner, they, John and Julius should enjoy a
                     chestnut frolic.
                  Rising from the breakfast table, Mr. Bennett said to Sol:
                  "Sol, I guess as Julius won't be worth much to us to-day, you and the little
                     boys had better go to drawing 'punkins.' John (fourth young Bennett) may repair
                     the fence around the cornfield; I see there are some pretty low places next to
                     the pasture."
                  John was only fourteen, and didn't yet care much about the girls. He proceeded
                     to fix the fence, and Sol and the little boys went at the "punkins."
               
               
                  
                  V.
                  After dinner the girls had their baskets on their arms prepared to proceed to
                     the chestnut grove. They were standing on the lawn in front of the house
                     waiting for John and Julius.
                  John was standing out by the barn talking with Sol who was hitching his team to
                     the cart for the afternoon's work, and Julius had gone there to get a tough,
                     well-seasoned, iron-wood fish-pole with which to whip the chestnut trees. He
                     came back alone, presently, to where the girls were expectantly waiting, and
                     proceeded to open the gate leading into the road.
                  Sophia asked:
                  "Why doesn't John come, Jule?"
                  "O, he says he and Sol got into the Tariff this forenoon and they haven't
                     finished it yet, and, as he and the girls are going home to-morrow, they must
                     close up this afternoon. He will be along by-and-by. Come girls! Come
                     Sophie!"
                  Sophia pouted as she passed through the gate. She wanted her charms
                     appreciated. I don't blame her any. She was a lovely girl.
                  The chestnut grove was situated about a mile from the house. At about half the
                     distance is a very pretty little creek that the party were obliged to cross in
                     order to get to it; the creek bounding—not running—through a dense wood of
                     hemlock and pine which extends laterally with, and back from it, several rods
                     either way.
                  The crossing of the creek is at a place called "The Falls." "The Falls" is a
                     more attractive little bit of picturesque scenery than you will often find.
                     Everything about the place is primeval and holy. It is more pretty and pure
                     than any separate view to be enjoyed at the head of Cayuga or at Watkin's Glen.
                     Nature's mantle of repose and purity, spread over the inviting scene ages ago,
                     man has never yet attempted to drag away, as at those places. He has never
                     invaded that sacred retreat with the disfigurement of bridge and stairway.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *This description is true of "The Falls" twenty years ago. I have not
                        visited the place nor learned of its aspect in a long time. I presume, at
                        the present time, cattle are grazing on the cliffs, morning and evening,
                        and stand lolling in the pool below, during the heat of a summer day. O,
                        man! The "dollar is Almighty."
                  
                  Settled a hundred feet into the bottom of a natural amphitheatre, three sides
                     of which are shaggy precipices of shale, whose brows are crowned and overhung
                     with a dark forest growth, and whose irregular faces are traversed in all
                     directions by gaping seams which Nature has provided as clinging places for the
                     stems of innumerable garlands and festoons of green, glossy vines and dark
                     evergreen shrubbery, is a pool of pure water some seven or eight rods in
                     extent, any direction. It appears as a cup, its interior fashioned and twined
                     with its wreaths of evergreen leafage, fit for gods to drain the libations from
                     that have been poured in their honor.
                  And pouring into this pool, or massive cup, to replenish its thirsty depths,
                     during the summer and fall, is a little cascade of water about forty feet wide,
                     from one to four inches thick, and about fifteen feet high.
                  The crossing place of this fine stream of water, to get to the chestnut grove,
                     is about fifty feet above the fall, where are placed stepping-stones of about
                     eight or ten inches in thickness, at convenient distances apart, and ranging
                     across at right angles with the current of the running water.
                  The approach to the crossing place may be described as something a little
                     curious, and of itself adds considerably in effect to the charms of the scenery
                     surrounding the cascade.
                  Above the cascade the banks of the stream are vertical and projecting
                     precipices, varying from fifteen to near fifty feet in height. Below, the water
                     starts off in its course from the pool but a few feet from the base of the fall
                     and at an acute angle with the course of the creek above, apparently running
                     back up stream, and thus continuing for about forty yards. This conduct of the
                     creek produces a singular conformation of precipice—a little tongue of double
                     precipice which juts down in easy slope, parallel with the course of the stream
                     both above and below, to the very brink of the fall, and thence continues on
                     down to the level of the pool. This tongue of land and rock goes by the name of
                     "The Nose" in the vocabulary of the neighborhood. It is, in fact, though wooded
                     to the summit with a dense young growth of beech, birch and hemlock, not unlike
                     a mammoth razor, and almost as sharp; the side next to the upper stream being a
                     vertical precipice, and that in juxtaposition with the lower being at an angle of declivity
                     half-way between forty-five degrees and perpendicular.
                  Coming to the creek therefore at the base, or upper extremity of "The Nose,"
                     the usual place of arrival from the Bennett side of the stream, he who desires
                     to cross must walk down the sharp ridge to the fall; then, turning sharp back
                     up the stream, he may proceed, when the water is low, on a narrow pathway of
                     dry, crumbled shale, extending along close under the overhanging cliff, until
                     he arrives at the row of crossing-stones.
                  The nutting party arrived at "The Falls" soon after setting out. The girls, as
                     much charmed with the beauties of the place as on former visits, and already
                     heated with their walk—the day was intensely warm for the season, the
                     atmosphere betokening showers—tarried in the cool, inviting, impervious
                     shade.
                  They lingered in quiet about fifteen minutes—the shade of an evergreen wood is
                     promotive of thoughtfulness to those who are inexperienced in its
                     mysteries—they lingered about fifteen minutes, contemplating and gathering some
                     agreeable thoughts, when, feeling entirely refreshed, they walked up the broken
                     bed of shale to the crossing-stones and continued their expedition.
                  The party soon arrived at the chestnut trees. Julius stripped off his coat and
                     vest at once and commenced to thrash the trees vigorously with his pole,
                     causing the nuts to fly off and about in showers, and patter down on the velvet
                     sward like rain, where the girls stepped gleefully about, picking them up.
                  Julius and the girls gathered nuts and played merrily for about an hour,
                     enjoying themselves very much. At the end of that time, having filled their
                     baskets, they began to think of returning to "The Falls" to play where the
                     shade was deeper and it was cooler.
                  But they had not yet started to return, when Belle, not as deeply engaged with
                     her thoughts in the play, and more observant than the others, casting her eyes
                     into the west where the sun was becoming obscured, discovered there an immense
                     mass of opacity. She called Julius' attention to the threatening aspect of the
                     western heavens.
                  "Yes!" said he; "it'll be a heavy one, and pretty quick, too. We
                     can get no farther than the old log house in the edge of the woods. Now then,
                     girls! A basket each, and I take two, and we're off!"
                  The nutting party set out at once and proceeded with rapid pace to the old log
                     house, arriving there before the shower had commenced to fall. But they had not
                     long to wait. They had been safely ensconced under the hospitable roof only
                     about five minutes when the streams of rain began to pour down. As Julius
                     predicted it would be, the shower was a heavy one. The great black
                     bank that Belle had discovered seemed to pour out the water in floods. Soon the
                     dry, hard earth all around them was submerged. The rain fell in this way—in
                     torrents—for more than an hour.
                  At the end of that time the black cloud had passed over, the sun came out
                     shining brightly again, and a refreshing breeze sprang up, filling the air with
                     its purity. Julius, remarking the breeze, thought they had better profit by it
                     and allow it to scatter the jewelly water drops from the leaves of the trees
                     before they should proceed on their way through the wood.
                  The girls complying, they lingered about the old house a few minutes, and then
                     continued their return to "The Falls."
                  And now, the tale approaching a point of critical and very peculiar interest,
                     and a point in which all the principal personages are involved, it will be
                     necessary to return to the barn for a few moments, where John and Solomon were
                     left, and ascertain what they are about.
                  Getting there in about fifteen minutes after the shower is over—I can easily
                     walk the distance in that time, and will not, like Julius and the girls, wait
                     for the dislodgment of the pearls from the hemlock and pine frondage—I discover
                     Solomon is just unyoking his oxen. He had brought them out from the barn and
                     was going for a load of "punkins," but Mr. Bennett had come out from the house
                     just in the "nick o' time," and had said that he guessed the "punkins" would be
                     pretty nasty to handle now, and Sol might go and play with the
                     girls if he wanted to.
                  He wouldn't have said this if he had thought Solomon would "fall in love" with
                     Sophie or Edna, or anything of that sort should transpire in consequence;
                     though he respected his intelligence quite highly, he didn't want such a
                     looking man for a son-in-law. And this was just the reason he had said to Solomon that he might go and play
                     with the girls if he wanted to; thinking all women must always look at the poor
                     fellow as he and most men did, he reasoned there could be no danger. What
                     woman, whose soul cherished any aspirations at all, would think of such a man?
                     He thought at least a presentable form must accompany a good understanding in
                     order to get any intelligent, respectable woman's esteem.
                  What poor fools most of us men are! How many of us who do not learn until too
                     late that most women worship mental strength as beauty and as
                     power existing in their highest forms—that often they will allow it to hide a
                     multitude of physical inconsistencies from their eyes—that the best of women,
                     if he be not regarded with levity by the world, may be subdued by love to
                     accept a great soul, though enshrined in an ugly casket. What poor fools most
                     of us men are, in this particular, until too late; and even after we have learned, still wonder why it can be so!
                  I think if Mr. Bennett had understood the philosophy of this, and had
                     understood what a terrible state the young hearts about him were about to get
                     into, he would have exerted himself to save his dear niece from the terrible
                     fate impending.
                  Well, dear man! It's a good thing for your excellent reputation for good sense
                     that you didn't know. It was a mighty good thing for you just then, that you
                     were not as able to penetrate into the wonderful mechanism of the human heart
                     as to take care of your dollars and cents.
                  O dear! I want to laugh!
                  So Solomon, eagerly accepting the boon of a couple hours' leisure, called to
                     John who was in the barn, and the two set out to discover the nutting
                     party.
               
               
                  VI.
                  Returning now to the girls and Julius, I perceive they have just arrived to the
                     bank of the creek opposite "The Nose," and have there paused and are engaged in
                     lively discussion with regard to crossing.
                  The extremely heavy shower has already swelled the little stream so that the
                     stepping-stones are submerged under two or three inches of water, and it is
                     rising. This perplexes the young ladies slightly, they not desiring to wet
                     their stockings.
                  Sophia and Ida would have stripped their feet in a minute, but Belle, who had
                     arrived to those years when female delicacy is the most sensitive—when it is at
                     its nicest, loveliest phase, had no notion of exposing her lily-white pedestals
                     to the roving gaze of Cousin Julius. She didn't explain herself in so many
                     words, but they understood her well enough.
                  Julius thought: "How sweet, and lovely, and maidenly she is! How much better I
                     love her for desiring to avoid the least exposure!
                  Sophia and Ida, modest girls, and therefore understanding and sympathising with
                     that superior refinement to which they, or Ida at least, had not yet arrived,
                     and did not therefore care about practicing, drew near and encircled her with
                     their arms, looking at Julius reproachfully and as though his company wasn't
                     wanted just then.
                  "Go along you naughty boy and hide yourself, and let us get across," says
                     Sophia.
                  Julius laughed:—
                  "No, no! I am here to take care of you, and there shan't any of you slip from
                     the stones and be swept over the fall through any negligence of mine."
                  "Well, what shall we do then if you will be perverse?"
                  "I had better carry you over."
                  He spoke as if inspired. He was thinking of getting Belle into his arms.
                  "O yes! yes! What fun!" chimed Ida, and she gave her sister a cunning look. She
                     more than suspected the state of affairs.
                  Said Belle—apprehending the thought of Julius—
                  "We have plenty of time. We can walk down to the bridge and cross there, and
                     perhaps see something interesting on the way."
                  The bridge was for the convenience of the highway, a mile below, and not more
                     than half a mile from Mr. Bennett's residence.
                  "No!" decisively interposed Julius, hedging her off; "there are several acres
                     of fallow in wheat between here and there, and two fields of corn adjoining
                     that, all extending back from the
                     creek a mile and a half. A splendid place to walk after the rain! wouldn't it
                     be? What a spectacle you would present to the view after getting across!"
                  He laughed heartily, highly amused with the picture his thoughts had conjured
                     up.
                  Sophia confirmed his statement. Belle also remembered to have observed the
                     fields at times when they had been passing along the road. There was, in fact,
                     besides the two fields of corn, a large field of wheat but just below them,
                     though winter wheat is seldom sown on pine and hemlock lands.
                  "Can't we cross above?" still urged Belle, meaning to exhaust every
                     expedient.
                  "Yes, there is a little bridge three miles up. It only necessitates a walk of
                     seven miles.
                  His tone of voice was happy and triumphant; he began to feel sure he should
                     hold her yet.
                  "Come Jule," laughed Ida, "pick me up!"
                  "No! no! you little rogue," he laughed back, "you can't catch me in that way.
                     The nuts go first. I'm not quite such a simpleton as to first carry three great
                     girls where they want to go, and then when I get back to their baggage, look
                     after, and see them running off without me."
                  Ida ran up and boxed his ears.
                  "You know better. You know we like the boys too well to run away from
                     them."
                  Notwithstanding, he was right—so far as she was concerned, any way. Ida was
                     just the girl to have run on and left him alone.
                  Julius gathered together the baskets of nuts and carried them over the creek.
                     Then returning, he caught up Ida, who was standing close to the water, leaning
                     invitingly towards him, with her hands joined before her person, and started
                     with her. On the way she looked so sparkling, so gleeful, so entirely animated,
                     so handsome, he bent his head and kissed her. She slapped him
                     lightly in the face two or three times—not displeased, nor particularly
                     pleased, either; only, though he was not her Leander, she liked him first rate
                     as a cousin, but society did not regard it as proper for boys to kiss their
                     girl-cousins at all times. That was all.
                  But he did not offer to kiss her again. Belle was in his thoughts.
                  Depositing Ida safely on the strip of broken shale, which would soon be covered
                     with water, the expectant lover returned for Sophia.
                  When Julius stepped on the crossing-stones with his sister, Belle was earnestly
                     inclined to follow him, if it should be at the expense of wet hose, but,
                     thinking also—
                  "I will not be a prude, and give them the right to laugh; I will let him carry
                     me; there can be no harm in it at all events," she waited.
                  Wherefore! When Julius came skipping eagerly and gaily back for the third time,
                     after getting Sophia safely landed, there was a young lady standing on the
                     shore, awaiting his approach, mute and quiescent, ready to be clasped in
                        his fond arms, but not smiling, nor feeling at all like smiling in
                     her heart.
                  But her mute protest against the state of affairs did not alarm Julius,
                     supposing he understood her feelings. He did not hesitate—he could not have
                     hesitated: she appeared so lovely, so divine a woman in his thoughts. He
                     immediately lifted the sweet burthen from the ground, and stepped into the
                     water.
                  The water was now a foot in depth on the stepping-stones, and running with
                     considerable velocity. He advanced slowly and carefully, feeling his way more
                     with his sure feet than by sight, using his eyes to devour the countenance of
                     the dear girl in his arms. She had become very dear to him within the two past
                     happy weeks.
                  As I have said, her features were not handsome; but her mind and heart
                     electrified her face with so much soul, her lips were so scarlet, and her mouth
                     so sweet, and Julius had learned to love her so much within the past two weeks,
                     that he could not, nor did he desire, to resist the temptation.
                  He raised her partly up, and brought his lips down to hers, as she lay
                     passively in his arms, and kissed her just as warmly as he knew how. The kiss
                     was prolonged and passionate.
                  Belle felt it so. She comprehended what a delicious joy it was to him, and
                     almost yielded: she was so kind-hearted.
                  And too, while his lips clung to hers, she did feel a slight thrill of
                     satisfaction run through and partially electrify her heart and person; but
                     before he had taken them away, she had thought—
                  
                  "He has no right to treat me so. He has never spoken a word. The kiss he gave
                     me at our first meeting, was his right in cousinly greeting, but now it is
                     different. He ought not to do so."
                  Still, she might not have rebuked him, had she not, at the instant he withdrew
                     his face from hers, caught sight of the other two girls standing just opposite
                     on the bridge of "The Nose," where they had clambered, their arms wound around
                     one another, and looking down upon her, laughing, while but a little above,
                     descending leisurely towards them, she saw John and Solomon.
                  If those inquisitive girls had only run along, and if Mr. Bennett had only held
                     his tongue and not spoken to Sol, but let him kept on with the "punkins," his
                     oldest son might, possibly, have yet got a better wife than he deserved.
                  Belle could have forgiven the trespass had it not been observed.
                     The thoughts of the past few days had placed her mind with regard to Julius in
                     one of the most delicately adjusted of balances: it was but a trivial weight
                     that should turn it either way.
                  The time had now arrived when the trivial weight was added; and it was added on
                     the side that was adverse to Julius; and Julius himself had added it. So much
                     the worse for his cause. Why couldn't he have known?
                  There they were, all four of them, looking down upon what was, so long as they
                     saw it, the shame that Julius was putting upon her. She could but continue the
                     thought her mind had conceived while his burning lips were yet glued to
                     hers.
                  She continued it:
                  "It is too bad! He has no business to do so, and he shall not."
                  She thought with decision—she said aloud, quietly, but shortly:
                  "Put me down!"
                  But Julius saw nothing—thought of nothing, now, but the dear girl in his arms.
                     The sweet kiss had thrilled his frame with the delirium of love, from center to
                     circumference. In a moment it had so inflamed his passion that his mind was
                     blinded—he was infatuated.
                  He caught her up into the closest of embraces and kissed her many, many
                     times.
                  "O, Bella! Bella! dearest Bella! I love you!" he whispered passionately.
                  But it was too late, now; forever too late. She saw the four standing together
                     on "The Nose." Both girls were laughing. Ida screamed out so that she
                     distinguished her speech even above the roar of the cataract—the girl
                     remembered the robbery from her own lips but just perpetrated—she screamed
                     out—
                  "Leave one for somebody else!"
                  Belle's face began to grow white with distress and shame. Those emotions
                     affected her differently than they do some women.
                  "Put me down!" she insisted a second time.
                  Julius was wild, wild with his love, now his lips had met hers and he had
                     spoken. He thought he might conquer with caressing. Again he covered forehead,
                     face, mouth, with the hot, devouring kisses.
                  "O, Bella! do give me something!" pleaded he. "You are my hope! my light! my
                     life!"
                  The four were still looking on, and the girls still laughing. Once more the
                     beleaguered Belle spoke; her voice now incisive as well as decisive:
                  "Put me down!"
                  Yet again he strained her to his heart, repeating the offensive kisses. The
                     poor, foolish, infatuated fellow knew not what he was doing.
                  "O, Bella! Bella! It cannot be you will not hear me. My love is too great to be
                     denied."
                  His speech was so pathetic that his voice was degenerated almost into a wail.
                     But the woman could now take no cognizance of that. She felt herself too
                     flagrantly outraged.
                  The four were still looking on. She felt that he had persisted in his first
                     aggression until it had become an actual insult. He was holding her in
                        their sight at his mercy in the midst of the waters and showed
                     no compassion for her helplessness. It angered her. But though her anger was
                     excited, she was cool. She thought calmly, saying to herself:
                  "Well! Mr. Julius Bennett, if you will not put me down without, I will make
                     you."
                  Belle Dimond's hand was soft and white—some girls who work always have such
                     hands—but though soft and white, there
                     was the usual supply of hard bones concealed within its delicacy.
                  She drew her soft, white, right hand back as far as his close embrace would
                     allow, clenched it, and struck him as hard as she could sharp in the face,
                     adding to the force of the blow in accents of the deepest scorn:
                  "Mean, contemptible, fellow!"
                  His face reddened under the ignominy. Her blow and the taunt had broken the
                     spell at last; more than that—it angered him. He thought sharply within
                     himself—
                  "Can she despise my great love so? Will she not yield? Mind and heart have
                     failed to win her. What can I do? For two weeks her mind has been rising above
                     mine. I have felt it. And now, to-day, she spurns my heart. Can I let her go,
                     when I love her so? It is now, or never. I know it. I have tried everything but
                     the last resort—the old, primitive method. Can I stoop to that? Yes, I must! I
                     can't let her go—give her up—yet. I feel that I shall fail in this
                     also; but I will try physical means—women are sometimes conquered with fear of
                     violence."
                  He concluded his mental harangue with saying to himself—half angrily, half
                     sadly—
                  "It is all there is left for me to do with her. She has commanded it so many
                     times, I will now put her down!"
                  Suiting action to his thought he stooped to immerse the now defiant Belle in
                     the rushing water, and now the reaction had commenced, now he was awake, he
                     would have been thorough about it—thorough, because he understood her well
                     enough to know that it was his only hope of winning her.
                  She was of those who must be conquered to be won. His only chance heretofore of
                     her ever acceding to a union with himself was the fear dawning in her mind that
                     she might yet love Solomon. Though learning to like Julius so very well, she
                     was also learning more and more all the time that his mind was on a lower plane
                     than hers; and I have intimated that such women mate only with superiors.
                  Julius' only hope then, now, was the method of the barbarian, and he knew it;
                     so, swift as a thought, he lowered the angry woman toward the water.
                  But her intuitions were quicker than his quick thoughts they were quicker than
                     lightning.
                  Almost before he had commenced to incline, she divined his intention and
                     commenced to struggle hard to free herself. Being a strong, lithe girl, her
                     wrenchings and writhings destroyed his equilibrium on the square block of stone
                     on which he was standing, before she had touched the water; he reeled, toppled
                     over, and they rolled together, side by side, in the fast swelling flood.
                  In an instant, almost, the swift current swept them from the row of stepping
                     stones about ten feet down the torrent to the only obstruction to the rush of
                     waters that was now visible in the stream. This was an irregular block of stone
                     with sharp, projecting angles, averaging some three feet across, rising about
                     six inches above the water, and lying longitudinally with its rapid flow.
                  As the water was hurrying the two prone bodies past this rock, Julius drew his
                     right arm suddenly away from its embrace, threw it quickly out, caught a sharp
                     corner, and held fast, his body floating alongside.
                  Clinging there, spite of all his strength, the force of the current, combined
                     with her own struggles, instantly rolled the person of Belle out from the
                     clasping embrace of the other arm, and down below him; but the hand held
                     tightly to her skirt into which he had immediately fastened it when he felt her
                     going from him.
                  The skirt, however, not strong enough to endure the sudden strain upon it,
                     caused by the check of the restraining hand when her person had rolled to the
                     extremity of his arm, tore half round the waist.
                  Belle, feeling the skirt giving way, and determined now to be free of her
                     tormentor at all hazards, be the danger and the appearances what they might,
                     instantly seized upon the circumstance as something happening happily in her
                     favor, used her hands dextrously and expeditiously, and tore it the remaining
                     circumference.
                  Its gatherings released, allowed it to open as she rent it away; she slipped
                     through and out, and floated in her underclothing swiftly down toward the brink
                     of the fall.
                  
                     She hated her cousin Julius.
                  
                  The now thoroughly angry woman was no sooner free than she tried to get on her
                     feet; but it was an impossibility. The bed of the stream was smooth, hard rock,
                     intensely slippery with a thin coating of sediment from the water, or substance of mossy growth, and the
                     racing waters were two feet deep. If she had been on her feet the swift current
                     would instantly have swept them from under her.
                  She could not, therefore, rise erect. She drifted swiftly down toward the
                     precipice.
               
               
                  VII.
                  The four who had been standing on "The Nose," very interested spectators of the
                     thrilling drama being enacted beneath their feet, hastened down the declivity
                     to the brink of the fall as soon as they perceived the two had fallen into the
                     water.
                  John, seeing his sister break loose from Julius just as he reached their level,
                     continued on to the foot of the fall without stopping, and immediately
                     commenced to divest himself of coat, vest and boots, preparatory to a plunge
                     into the pool. He expected to rescue his sister from the water so soon as he
                     should see her person shoot the cataract.
                  Both girls, singularly enough, surprised at his action in the emergency,
                     stopped at the brink of the fall to watch Solomon,
                     instead of going on down to the lower level where John had gone, and as they
                     had at first thought of doing.
                  Solomon, a step behind John, and seeing the same that he saw, turned at an
                     exact right angle as he reached the level of the upper water and ran out in it,
                     parallel with the verge of the precipice over which the flood was raging, and
                     about three yards above. He anticipated the swift rushing current would sweep
                     him over, but swiftly resolved to make the attempt to save his
                        love from going down.
                  "If she should go down," he thought, "it might cost her her life." And that
                     life he felt in his secret heart might yet be inestimably precious to him.
                  He had on his feet a pair of heavy, coarse boots. As a poor man, and desirous
                     to economize his "shoe leather," he had driven two rows of sharp-headed nails
                     around the outer edges of the soles of these boots as a protection to the
                     leather. During the summer the constant friction from the stubble of the hay
                     and grain fields, as he pursued his busy occupation from week to week, had worn
                     the leather away from between these nails, until now they projected quite sharp
                     and prominent from the soles.
                  Running along as rapidly as the rapid running water would permit, Solomon soon
                     discovered that the nails in his boots were admirable preventives to slipping
                     on the slimy rock. Cutting through the mossy coating into the hard bed of the
                     creek, and penetrating slightly, like so many little spikes, the nails enabled
                     him to sustain himself anywhere where his strength could resist the weight and
                     momentum of the rushing waters.
                  Solomon ran out in the same line on which he had started, reaching the middle
                     of the creek just as the tide was whirling Belle past.
                  He turned on his feet, following her with his eyes as she was rushing past,
                     stretching forth his right hand diagonally across the current, and down—down—it
                     followed her.
                  Was she out of his reach? He almost despaired.
                  Belle saw him, and held up her hands towards him. She would accept his
                     assistance. She would rather not go over the fall; though she was not
                     afraid.
                  Her feet were within two feet of the ledge. She said to herself, calmly, just
                     as the critical moment was arriving:
                  "If he catches me I guess I'll have him; but if he lets me go down I won't have
                     him if I die an old maid: unless, unless—" her mind hesitated—"unless he goes
                     with me, and then I don't know."
                  So, so! charming Bella! Did you really believe he wouldn't go with you if you
                     went over that precipice? You know well enough now that brother John wouldn't
                     have been the one to fish you from that seething caldron, had you gone over,
                     and into it.
                  Just as Belle had completed her mental address, Solomon, taking one last
                     advancing step toward her, still reaching far, far down with his long arm and
                     good right hand, barely caught the ends of the two longest fingers of her right
                     hand between his thumb and index finger.
                  It was enough. The thumb and finger closed like a vise. Belle thought at first
                     she should shriek out with pain—it hurt her so. She thought the bones were
                     certainly crushed, and she expected to see the blood drip when he should let
                     go.
                  
                  And he, standing stanchly and firmly braced against the current pulled the
                     precious weight slowly and safely up, and took her in his willing
                     arms.
                  The thrills that her touch, wet as she was, sent through his frame, were as
                     electrifying as any that had shaken Julius; but made of sterner stuff, he could
                     control himself and commit no folly.
                  Nevertheless, he was influenced as lovers are. Walking carefully towards the
                     shore he looked into the blue-gray eyes in search of something, and thought he
                     could discover, far down in their bright, brightest depths, the very faintest
                     of faint smiles that might yet accumulate warmth and volume, and well up and
                     out in joy for him; but he was not certain.
                  Still, he gave the wet and draggled figure a good, hearty squeeze on the
                     strength of the thought and his love, whispering so that none but she could
                     possibly hear:
                  "O my precious! If you had gone over, it might have killed you."
                  He didn't get anything in return. She didn't vouchsafe him a word, nor a sign;
                     neither did she deny him. She was thinking:
                  "He'll make love fast enough with little encouragement. He's got the right kind
                     of stuff in him—the courage needful to storm a fortress. If he hasn't he can't
                     get me! But he has, and I'll love him well enough after I'm won,
                     so that he shall not be sorry."
                  And he?—well, she was right: he took heart that he had not been repulsed
                     outright, feeling that the squeeze had amounted to a little more than to save
                     the girls some wringing of wet clothes—a laudable business that they undertook
                     in about a second after he had delivered his mermaid into their care.
                  Julius, the while, pulled himself on to the rock to which he was clinging, as
                     soon as Belle had escaped him. Instantly rising, he stepped into the water
                     again to pursue the girl he had lost.
                  Feeling the water sweeping his legs from under him as soon as he was in it, he
                     started and ran with its hurrying volume, passing close by where Belle had
                     been, immediately after Solomon had drawn her into his arms. Unavoidably
                     gaining impetus as he descended he leaped boldly out when he reached the ledge,
                     striking in the pool below, near twenty feet from the base of the fall.
                  Rising to the surface directly, he swam to the shore, where he found John
                     pulling on his boots.
                  Ida, seeing Julius go over the fall, involuntarily started to run down where
                     John was; she was restrained by Sophia, who flung an arm around her as she
                     attempted to pass, and said carelessly:
                  "Stop! stop! Ida! He's safe enough. They all jump from there twenty times every
                     summer when they come here to bathe."
                  John and Julius came up to where the girls were drying Belle.
                  Solomon met Julius with the epithet, "Coward!" contemptuously spoken, as he
                     advanced.
                  Julius' hazel eyes snapped; he clenched his fist and was about to spring; but
                     before he had completed the demonstration, "the sober, second thought" gaining
                     the ascendency, he calmed and contented himself with saying evenly and
                     steadily:
                  "You know better than that, Sol!"
                  Solomon, serenely regarding the bold, unblenching front, turned to him, calling
                     to mind one time when he had known his courage thoroughly tested, and
                     reflecting that he really did not know all the motives, emotions and
                        circumstances which might have influenced Julius' late conduct,
                     responded, after two or three moments, candidly, and with a trace of kindness
                     in his tone:
                  "Perhaps, you are right, Julius. We will talk about it some other time."
                  After the little episode between the rivals, John wrapped his coat about his
                     sister—Solomon was coatless—and the party, gathering up the baskets of nuts,
                     proceeded to the house with despatch, Julius still retaining in his possession
                     the captured skirt, to which he had clung from the first.
                  Belle never claimed it. I suppose she was willing he should retain about him
                     that much of her preciousness.
               
               
                  
                  VIII.
                  That same evening, after the chestnut frolic had ended so disastrously to one
                     lover's hopes, they all went on foot, about a mile, to pay their parting visit
                     at the other uncle's. The afternoon sun having nearly dried the rain-fall and
                     there being good moonlight, the walk was pleasant and was enjoyed by the
                     party.
                  At the close of a pleasant evening's visit, when they were about returning to
                     Mr. Bennett's, Solomon asked Belle particularly to walk with him. She cordially
                     and readily signified her willingness. There was no hesitancy in her mind now
                     as there had been the day he asked her to accompany him in to dinner at the
                     wayside tavern. She did not now think so much of personal graces—it was much
                     more the man who interested her; still there is no denying there was a twinge
                     of regret lingering in those regions of the heart where pride and self-esteem
                     are harbored, that he was not of different appearance. She knew well enough why
                     he had asked her to walk with him, and she was pretty sure what her answer
                     would be, yet she was not quite reconciled: if only he could have been a little
                     taller and not quite so wide!
                  They lingered behind the others on the way. Solomon improved his time. He told
                     her he loved her at the outset, but desired her not to answer him until he
                     should make her acquainted with some of his hopes.
                  She listened, if not delightedly, at least attentively and respectfully.
                  He told her how he had lived heretofore—always in the woods; never had been at
                     school a day in his life; that he hadn't a cent of property; that all his
                     earnings heretofore had been dedicated to save his father's little property
                     from an impending mortgage; that the best he could do, being fitted for nothing
                     but manual labor, was to get some twelve or fourteen dollars a month; that he
                     was as strong, and at many kinds of labor could accomplish as much as any two
                     of the best men that could be picked in the country; that he wanted to get a
                     good piece of land of his own where he could get the full value of what he
                     could do; that he was apt to learn—wanted books, wanted to study, and wanted an
                     educated, intelligent, competent wife to superintend his education; and he
                     thought that with the help of the land, the books, and the wife, he should in
                     the future get to Congress as the mischievous Ida had suggested.
                  Solomon was eloquent, and made his statement effectively, closing with asking
                     Belle to love him and be the wife he desired, and in return promising his life
                     should be dedicated to her happiness with a devotion that should never waver
                     nor ever tire.
                  He knew to whom he was talking. He knew that if this royal girl accepted him
                     her life would be dedicated to his welfare as much as his could possibly be to
                     hers.
                  Belle, as she listened, gathered all his language into her soul most
                     completely; she believed it would yet belong there; but she did not reply. She
                     knew he would perform all he had promised, and she sympathized with his noble
                     aspirations, O, so keenly! She admired and respected his courage, his
                     sincerity, and his abilities very much, indeed; but his form! What would her
                     folks—what would everybody say? She thought of that and much more that his
                     singular personal appearance suggested. It grieved and pained her terribly. Now
                     that the test had come she was weaker than she had expected to be. She firmly
                     believed she should be his wife, but she could not speak yet, she felt so
                     overwhelmed.
                  Solomon began to get anxious. At last he addressed her again:
                  "Bella, are you sorry that I love you?"
                  Something must be done—something said. She knew it was the greatest of
                     cruelties to feed so choice a soul as his with silence at such a time. She
                     mastered her emotions with a great effort, so that she could address him
                     naturally and kindly. Then she spoke:
                  "No, Mr. Ingoldsby, I am proud and glad to be loved by so noble a man."
                  He put his arm about her, drew her to him, and kissed the honey-dew from her
                     lips. She readily and naturally allowed him to do as he desired, but she did
                     not respond.
                  Solomon could but remark it. He was a great-hearted as well as a large-minded
                     man, and the great-hearted notice if there be the least thing amiss or unusual
                     in the manner of those they
                     love—unless they judge the notice may inflict a greater grief—they are so
                     desirous to remedy the pain or the sorrow; and too, despite his strength of
                     character, though perhaps it may really have arisen because of that strength
                     there was blended with this the feeling grown out of the fact that he had never
                     had a kiss from any female except his mother and sisters—a feeling that caused
                     him to peculiarly crave that delicious lover's sweet, or he might not have
                     remarked, as he did, a little solicitously and with a slight strain of
                     inquiry:
                  "Bella! dear Bella! kiss me, and call me Solomon."
                  The self-possessed woman looked at him steadily and with cool, smiling eyes in
                     the moonlight—she would yet have let him gone if her reply could have scared
                     him away—she looked at him steadily and calmly, not a thrill circulating in any
                     part of her fine organization as she answered in even tones:
                  "Solomon, I do not love you."
                  "Don't love me!" he exclaimed, startled and alarmed, "then why do you allow me
                     to caress you?"
                  The question now was put that probed her secret soul to its deepest depths.
                     Belle did not flinch. She had made up her mind. And so she allowed her eyes to
                     grow luminous with friendship, if not with love, when she answered fair and
                     square to the truth, just as I should have anticipated she would:
                  "Because you are in every place in my mind and I shall love you some time."
                  The hungering lover caught her impulsively to his heart and kissed her—I don't
                     know how long—it was a long while—he beat Julius by a great deal; he kissed her
                     so long that I wouldn't write it down if it wasn't in the story. I'm almost
                     ashamed for him. The best I can do for him is to ask you to remember that he
                     had been famishing for something of the kind all his life, and had got awfully
                     hungry. Don't blame him too severely my youthful critics; ye can never know
                     what it is to be in such a predicament, as regards the girls, as he had been in
                     all his life.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *Some inquisitive reader may inquire if Solomon had never attended any of
                        the "kissing bees" so common in the rural districts, and thus have been
                        unavoidably called upon to kiss a girl now and then.
                     I answer: I am pretty familiar with the young man's personal history, and
                        I know that the girls of the secluded neighborhood, where he was reared,
                        all regarded him with repugnance—some as they would a gorilla—from his
                        infancy. This was a sad, bitter truth to him that he learned before
                        arriving at his teens; and holding in his native disposition those fine,
                        gentlemanly instincts which forbid encroachment on the feelings of the
                        softer sex, he had soon learned to forbear approaching them. During his
                        growing youth he certainly had invitations to the neighborhood parties,
                        but seldom accepted; and, when he did, could never be prevailed to chase
                        a girl around the circle. He preferred to sit and talk with the old folks
                        in the corner. Most thoroughly did he learn the lesson of years of
                        repression—of rigidly adhering to his gentlemanly instincts. Though his
                        most sincere and warm friends, even Mr. Bennett's daughters would
                        inwardly have shrunk from the contact of his lips during any of their
                        youthful frolics. Solomon knew it.
                  
                  But still, though he kissed her so warmly, Belle did not yet respond; but when
                     he released her finally every part of her person that was exposed to his gaze,
                     even to finger tips, was blushing celestial, rosy red; 
                        
                           "Her speaking face
                           The flashing blood with blushing did inflame;"
                        
                      and, too, she put her arm about his neck, speaking quite softly:
                  "Solomon! I like your kisses. They are good."
                  She was won.
                  Before reaching Mr. Bennett's they had arranged to be married in the winter.
                     Arriving at the house after a long time, Solomon, hearing the wind rising, gave
                     as a parting remark with his "good night" as they were about to
                     enter:
                  "There has been a change in the weather."
                  That night, for the first time, after she had gone to bed, Belle Dimond lay
                     awake a long time, thinking how much she might have lost if Julius had proposed
                     in season and she had accepted.
                  The next morning verified Solomon's prophecy of the evening before; the sky was
                     filled with cold, gray clouds, in keeping with the atmosphere which was
                     perceptibly colder.
                  The stage-coach came along about nine o'clock.
                  They were all gathered around to see John and the girls off.
                  Julius felt that his hopes were dead—he knew it—still he could not refrain from
                     saying pointedly to Belle, desirous to confirm conviction if he must lose
                     her:
                  "It is fitting you should leave us now the Indian summer is
                     ended."
                  She turned upon him, her eyes sparkling and glinting sharp across the rays of
                     colder morning light, and bore him down with a reply as pointed as the remark
                     with which he had approached her:
                  
                  "Yes! The Indian summer is ended; and I am glad of
                     it, for winter is coming, and I like winter in its season."
                  She smiled a warm, luxuriant, happy smile into the boy's sober face. It was
                     thus they parted. She had not forgiven him. Well! could she, just yet?
                  If you are ever rejected by a woman who is your superior, and have left her
                     with scorn in her heart toward you, never attempt to bandy words with her
                     afterward, for, as sure as you do, she'll thrust you into the gulf of
                     humiliation more deeply still; and you'll know it, too, and feel
                     it.
                  "Hell contains no fury like a woman scorned," but perhaps Earth may show you a
                     resemblance in the mind of "she" who scorns.
                  Belle remembered the purple silk and the Date Leaves on their arrival in
                     S—.
               
               
                  IX.
                  After she had reached home again, kissed them all, and made little Lucy happy
                     with her treasure, her mother soon had Belle to herself.
                  She spoke immediately:
                  "I see, my darling," said she, "you have brought something with you besides the
                     silk and the cards."
                  How quick the affectionate mother is to read her daughter's heart.
                  "Yes, mother."
                  "Who is he, and what?" she asked kindly.
                  Belle gave her lover's name and recounted other essentials, adding at the
                     close, a little fearfully:
                  "Mother! dear mother! I'm afraid you won't like him."
                  "No fear for any one you choose, Bella!"
                  "But, mother, I'm afraid you'll think he looks so—so—so—what shall I say?—so
                        outre, perhaps. I hardly think you can
                     quite apprehend his appearance from the description I have given."
                  "The looks do not make the man, dear; I know you would not make a mistake."
                  "Will you speak to father and tell him? We will have one another now, and if
                     father should oppose it would be terrible. Neither of them would ever
                     yield."
                  She spoke quite anxiously.
                  "Yes, dear. Don't harbor a fear. It shall be all right."
                  Belle drew the two apples from her pocket:
                  "See, mother!" said she.
                  "What!" inquired Mrs. Dimond, curiously, as she took the apples in her hand and
                     examined them, "were there two of them?"
                  "Yes, two."
                  "And is it as the apples say? Was it the old story—Mammon bidding against
                     affection?"
                  "Not quite that, mother. They both love me; still, one is wealthy,
                     comparatively, and the other penniless."
                  "Who gave the diamond?"
                  "Ought I to tell that? Would it be just to him?"
                  "You ought to tell your mother everything while you are under her care. Your
                     secrets are safe with her if she deems it advisable to keep them, and you know
                     she loves you too well to desire to ever causelessly wound your feelings."
                  "Mother! don't you think cousin Julius is a very fine young man?"
                  "I thought he was a very fine boy when I saw him two years ago,"
                     said the mother, strongly emphasizing the name, boy.
                  "He is a fine boy yet," confirmed Belle.
                  "Yes, I thought it," responded the mother.
                  Belle now related the history of the intercourse with her two lovers, asking at
                     the close:
                  "Do you think if Julius had proposed before carrying me into the water, I would
                     have accepted him?"
                  "Yes; he is capable and worthy, if yet a boy. He had inspired your esteem; and
                     I think, as you have stated, your vague dread of Solomon would have weighed
                     heavily in influencing your decision, if he had asked at the fitting time for
                     him to have asked."
                  "But wouldn't it have been a mistake for me if I had accepted?"
                  "No, my dear; not really a mistake. Julius could have made you happy; though
                     there being men superior to him, and you not accepting him, there would always
                     be the chance that you might be sought and won by some such one, traveling by
                     whose side, your soul should grow and
                     expand into greater beauty and perfection than it possibly could with him. As
                     it seems, heaven has guarded you kindly and you are now mated with one of those
                     men. But I perceive from your asking if it would not have been a mistake if you
                     had accepted Julius that you have slightly misapprehended my meaning with
                     regard to your ability to choose a husband for yourself. What I meant when I
                     said that you could be trusted with regard to the affections, was, that I think
                     that no man of bad heart or really weak mind ever could, or can, cheat
                     you."
                  "No! dear mother, no man can ever cheat me so long as I keep the principles you
                     have given me, and so long as God continues the use of the powers he has given.
                     And I can see too, now, Julius has a good heart, and I have used him hardly.
                     But, mother, his love did make him insult me so cruelly before them all! Yet if
                     I could see him I would forgive and ask to be forgiven."
                  "Right, my own daughter, from beginning to end. You can write to him, and that
                     will probably be better for him. And now, dwelling on your difficulty with him
                     brings the apples to my mind again. I will ask: are you doing well to keep
                     Julius' apple? You have put him away; ought not you also to put his things
                     away?"
                  "Mother," said Belle, a rare smile of happiness bursting out upon her face,
                        "Ida would not marry the man I am going to take for a husband
                     for the world and all there is in it. Perhaps the thought is a foolish one, yet
                     it always rises irresistibly in the connection, and has stayed by me for many
                     an hour, that, may be, some time she'll want a husband. Who can
                     tell but she may like Julius' apple? This is why I have kept it; only retaining
                     it thus long in order that you might first see it." And hereupon she related
                     the history of Ida's recent conduct, to the minutest particular, as a faithful
                     sister and daughter ought.
                  When she had finished, Mrs. Dimond said:
                  "Call Ida in, give her her apple, and leave us together."
                  Belle did as bidden, offering the apple with the diamond on it to her sister as
                     she came in, remarking at the same time:
                  "From cousin Julius to me, and from me to Ida."
                  "I don't want it," said Ida bluntly.
                  "Never refuse anything from a friend that it cannot possibly harm yourself, or
                     any one else, to receive," said the mother.
                  "Mother, please, I don't want it! I don't care enough for Julius to eat his
                     apples." She spoke decisively, and also as though troubled.
                  "Take the apple and wait and see what may transpire in the future," persisted
                     the elder sister.
                  "I am better off without it."
                  "Ida!" again interrupted the mother, "I shall not command it, but I
                        advise you to take the apple."
                  Ida advanced and received the apple from her sister. Belle retired. Mrs. Dimond
                     now reviewed her daughter's conduct during the late visit, reproving her
                     severely.
                  Ida, deeply grieved at incurring her mother's displeasure, not feeling entirely
                     blameful, and thinking to conciliate her kind parent, besought appealingly:
                  "Dear, dear mother! if you could only see Sol I don't believe you would talk so
                     hard to me."
                  "I shall see him."
                  "O yes! so you will. You are going out there in the winter. I'm so glad! Then
                     you won't think I'm so bad."
                  The excellent mother again reproved severely:
                  "There is no excuse for her who makes pastime of another's misfortunes. It
                     shows there is deformity in her heart that should be rooted out. Remember that,
                     Ida, and strive to fill your mind with true, loving thoughts, and charity
                     toward your fellow-beings. But with regard to my seeing Mr. Ingoldsby: you
                     forget, or are unthinking. He is laboring for uncle Bennett only during the
                     summer season and will not be there in the winter."
                  "Then how can you see him?"
                  "He is coming here."
                  "Coming here?" mechanically queried Ida, puzzled, and not a little
                     astonished.
                  "Yes, certainly, I said coming here."
                  Ida, during this conversation, was standing in front of her mother, who was
                     sitting. The information seemed to bewilder her for a moment. For a minute she
                     stood like a statue; her features all instinct with intelligence, but as if
                     thought and sentience had been suddenly frozen as she stood:—a piece of
                     Crawford's sculpture in the Central
                     Park Art Gallery portrays my idea and the picture almost exactly:—thus she
                     stood for a minute. Then suddenly, reason resuming her sway again—thought,
                     released from the fetters of frost by the all-potent, genial warmth of soul,
                     electrified her with new life. Reason resumed her sway, and with her resumption
                     of power a new thought had been born into life—a thought that exercised the
                     mind of the fair girl greatly, though her mother could see it also saddened her
                     a little. She saw that it was in a pensive as well as an eager tone that her
                     daughter questioned:
                  "Mother, were there two apples?"
                  "Yes, darling."
                  "And was there a natural device on the other?"
                  "Yes, a heart."
                  "And there was a strife, and the heart won?"
                  "Yes, the heart won."
                  "I know! and Belle is glad."
                  "Yes, Belle is glad, and I'm glad."
                  "Mother," said the young girl, a little sadly now, "I could have got him, but I
                     wouldn't marry Sol Ingoldsby if he were the only man in the world."
                  "Yes, you could have got him, we know—Belle and I. It's just as right, however,
                     as it is, and you'll be happy otherwise."
                  "Yes, I'll be happy after a long while," said Ida wearily, for one so young;
                     "but Belle will be happier than I."
                  "Ida! Ida!" said her mother reprovingly, "remember no one can lose what she
                     will not take."
                  "Yes, I know, but sometimes one cannot help but wish that some things were more
                     suitable to one's tastes and education, so that one could take them."
                  "God orders everything for the best."
                  "Yes, dear mother, I believe it, and I will keep Julius' apple till it is ripe,
                     and then eat it, but should he seek me in the future as premonitions seem to
                     indicate he may I shall never love him as I ought to love."
                  "Yes, you are right," said her mother, "but be sure God ordains everything for
                     the best, and you can be happy in any event, if you will."
                  "Still, mother, it does seem as if it would have been better if Julius could
                     have had Sol Ingoldsby's mind and heart, or if Sol could have been blessed with
                     Jule's perfect bodily proportions; then, what might have been! I'm only
                     fifteen, but I know my power."
                  For a moment the young girl rose to her utmost stature, and stood, proud,
                     triumphant, and radiant with that proud, stirring thought which lives so
                     congenially in the hearts of so many of her sex; but immediately she subsided
                     into the sedateness that now seemed to be fastening on her. Her mother warned
                     her reproachfully:
                  "There, there! Ida! You mustn't think in that way. It is very
                     wrong. Leave it all with God; He fashions us just right; He provides for us
                     just right. You are a very young girl to think about such things: too young to
                     think about love and a husband for several years. The subject should not have
                     been introduced had it not seemed unavoidable. Put it all away from your mind
                     now and go about your studies and play as usual."
                  Ida's language to her sister in the hall of her uncle Bennett's house recurred
                     to memory and overwhelmed her as she replied:
                  "Mother, I am a woman! I can never be a careless girl again."
                  "My dear daughter can put all foolish pride from her heart, rule her thoughts,
                     and do her duty," said the mother gravely.
                  "Yes, and I will," bravely responded Ida.
                  And they separated.
                  Now I will acknowledge that portions of this peculiar conversation between the
                     amiable mother and her excellent daughters—conversation that I have recorded
                     substantially and almost exactly as it occurred—appears a little
                        misty to me. I have turned it in my mind in all manner of
                     shapes, examined it in all manner of lights, seeking an explanation of its
                     apparent obscurities, but I can find none unless they have cheated themselves,
                     or unless I accept as true the principle of divination assumed, or arrogated to
                     himself by the Scottish Seer—unless I accept as true that there is such a
                     principle ruling in human affairs, and that the mother and daughters were
                     mistresses of it, and, sure of reading the signs, could say as confidently as
                     did he:
                  "Coming events cast their shadows before."
                  I am not a believer in, and have nothing to do with Biology, Mesmerism,
                     Spiritualism, etc., etc., and so on, but, I pause to inquire: Is there such a principle in
                     human psychology—are there human minds of so refined and subtle a character
                     that they can place themselves in rapport with the Divine Essence
                     or any of His agents and gather a foreknowledge of events that It graciously
                     shadows forth to them, set, and defined, as may be said, in a mist? I will say,
                     candidly, that I know nothing to a certainty whether such pretensions be
                     founded in Truth; but I will also say that the real sequel to this tale,
                     consummated years after the extraordinary conversation of those three
                     intelligent women—they are more than ordinarily intelligent; I am acquainted
                     with them and know—should seem to confirm that the marvelous claims of the
                     "Wizard" must have been based on some tangible, upholding support. Yet, those
                     intelligent women may have simply accomplished only their own Imaginings by reason of their faith in their future Reality to be, and thus
                     have been unwittingly instrumental in deluding their own high
                     Intelligences.
                  But of that, perhaps, the reader can judge with more satisfaction to himself
                     when I relate, which I will now proceed to do, the principal events that
                     occurred during the course of the next twenty years in the lives of the persons
                     of chiefest consequence in my story.
               
               
                  X.
                  Solomon coming in the winter, as Belle and he had arranged, they were married.
                     He staid a week after that important event.
                  The young people of the neighborhood were at first inclined to "make fun" of
                     him; but his steady, straightforward conduct—his manliness—never appearing to
                     heed their levity—always serene, apt and ready—soon put them down, so that when
                     he went away at the expiration of the week, taking Belle with him, most of them
                     had acquired a wonderful respect for his short, wide person.
                  When he and Belle started out together to carve out their fortunes and to make
                     their destiny, Solomon had a hundred dollars for his last year's labor. Mr.
                     Dimond presented Belle with two hundred and fifty dollars, besides the outfit
                     given by her mother.
                  The young wife handed her money to Solomon as soon as she received it. This
                     made his fund three hundred and fifty dollars, quite a little fortune to him.
                     He regarded it as precious. Its possession did really make him eventually
                     independent.
                  Acting under Belle's advice, he took fifty dollars and expended it for books of
                     her selection, about half of them choice and valuable text books such as were
                     then used in the best schools.
                  Taking now the remainder of their money and collecting together their goods
                     they started, joyous and hopeful, for a new State—the bountiful and nourishing
                     West. Few women can conceive how happy Belle already was. She had got over all
                     fear that Solomon could ever be pitied or laughed at by any one for long,
                     consequently she could give herself entirely to love, and the man she loved was
                     blessed with a refined, choice soul, capable to rise to heights as exalted as
                     could hers. Her heart was buoyant with bright, bright hopes in the future. She
                     looked far into the horizon of her future and it was undimmed by a cloud; she
                     saw it serene, brilliant, and glowing with mellow, golden warmth and rosy hope.
                     What more could she desire? She was happy—so happy!
                  Arrived at their destination, Solomon purchased one hundred and sixty acres of
                     excellent, heavily timbered land, for which he paid two hundred dollars. With
                     what was left of the remaining hundred, after having paid traveling expenses,
                     he purchased a cow, a yoke of oxen, and some few other necessaries; then the
                     money was exhausted.
                  Now he was ready. He took his axe in his hand, drove his oxen into the "woods"
                     before him, and soon rolled up a roomy house of logs for himself and the dear
                     wife who was waiting.
                  When the walls were up Belle came twelve miles through the shadowy glooms where
                     there was not an opening. She took her place in the new house in the wilderness
                     and went to work with a gay, light heart.
                  Though Belle was a high-bred woman—though during the days of her Misshood she
                     had attended better schools and had always enjoyed better food and had always
                     worn better clothing than many of the fashionables who are a respected part of
                     the best society of the cities, still, she had always worked, and was one of the sort who could happily adapt
                     herself to any circumstances mistress of the situation.
                  And so now, while in what was then the great Western Woods, having the man she
                     wanted, she sang at her work, and when she was sitting out in the forest close
                     by, witnessing his crashing of the giant trees, all the day long. It seemed to
                     her—and she has since said she then felt—as though her life had become a
                     continual jubilee.
                  Solomon labored from daylight till dark, all the year round, accomplishing
                     prodigies in clearing, and always in the evening, and often far
                     into the night, penetrating deep into the fascinating mysteries of his books,
                     the dear Belle always by his side to guide lovingly and to explain. Blessed
                     with perfect physical constitutions, no hour of the day ever found them
                     wearied; they were always laboring joyously on. Care nor fatigue ever entered
                     that blessed, happy home, sequestered so far away in the wilderness.
                  Ten years of this life passed away—ten of the happiest years that two human
                     beings ever lived. At the end of that time, Solomon is master of flocks and
                     herds, of a commodious house, capacious barns stored with wealth of hay and
                     grain, and he beholds around him an intelligent, flourishing community in which
                     he and Belle are leaders.
                  Books he has now in abundance. All the current literature of the day lies on
                     his tables and reposes on his shelves. He meets friends wherever he goes. He
                     attends all meetings within his reach; speaks often and always to the purpose.
                     He never makes a mistake; is always listened to with the deepest respect
                     whenever he has anything to say; he never fails to search directly to the heart
                     and grasp the life of any subject that he touches.
                  He has been elected at different times to all the important offices in town.
                     The county has heard of him. His fame is beginning to precede him, and the boys
                     no longer laugh at his uncouth personal presence when he enters for the first
                     time a place that is new to him. When he approaches they begin to whisper in
                     tones that are quite perceptibly hushed with awe:
                  "There comes Mr. Ingoldsby!"
                  Only a few years more, when the stranger who has not heard of him, if there be
                     any such, visits his 
                        nighborhood
                        neighborhood
                      and sees him racing swiftly along the open village street of
                     Ingoldsbyville, sitting by the side of the stately Belle in their carriage,
                     both gleeful and happy, and inquires curiously:
                  "Who is that marvel of broadness and shortness, sitting by the side of that
                     elegant woman in that splendid 'Rig'?" his neighbor will reply with exultant
                     pride:
                  "That is the talented Ingoldsby of whom you ought to have heard often
                     enough."
                  Ten, thirteen more years slip silently by.
                  Last winter Judge Ingoldsby sat in the Legislature of his adopted State. He was
                     a power there. He is destined to be yet a greater power.
                  Despite his years of nightly vigil visited on the days of Herculean labor
                     performed on his farm—he actually chopped and logged the whole of the hundred
                     and sixty alone, purchasing another forty subsequently for a wood lot—despite
                     those years of nightly vigil and days of Herculean labor he is yet in his
                     prime. There is not a gray hair in his head. But a little past forty-five, he
                     will be in Congress in less than five years, prepared and able to give his
                     country a life-time of service yet. I hope he may be allowed to live when he
                     gets there, for God knows the country needs such service as he can give.
                  And Belle! what of her?
                  Supremely radiant in happiness and matronhood she faithfully cares for the
                     interests of their happiest of homes, dispenses numberless social blessings
                     among her neighbors, and presides a worshiped Priestess at all festive
                     gatherings in town and county. There is more light in her countenance and more
                     spring in her step than there was at nineteen. She says that young and elastic
                     with happiness as she was then, she is younger and happier now.
                  It is so; she and her husband, joyous as two children playing tireless through
                     a happy summer day, are gaily climbing together to that perpetual bright
                     youthfulness of heart which can never be dimmed nor destroyed.
                  If it be that this sweet, noble woman did "fool" herself with her
                     own imaginings during her earlier youth it was certainly a most
                     happy deluding for her.
                  They have eight children, Solomon and Belle. The two oldest are in college;
                     bright, brave boys they are, regarded with pride by their fond Alma Mater. They
                     are a little taller than their mother,
                     and not quite so broad as their father; their foreheads are high as his and
                     wide as hers.
                  They are two Athletes, both of the mind and in the gymnasium. I hope they have
                     been trained correctly—that their teachers have faithfully continued the good
                     work commenced by their parents and have attended to the fixing of good
                     principles in their minds, for two such kings as they can be might
                     ruin a republic.
                  And how does Ida fare?
                  Ten years have also slipped silently by for her since the time of the visit to
                     uncle Bennett's. Ten otherwise eventful years, but singularly enough, bringing
                     to her no excitement, no change, no acceptable lover. There were many
                     approached her, but they were all coolly and quietly turned away. I don't
                     censure her any, nor should you. They were beneath her. She was a royal girl
                     with a royal mind.
                  Living at her father's quiet farm-house—Mr. Dimond and his wife eschewed
                     society except that of relatives and their immediate neighbors—she met few
                     besides the farming youth around her, and, as is often the case with some
                     particular locality, there was but little mind among them. Certainly, however
                     kindly they might be disposed, she would listen to none such, not for yet
                     awhile, at least.
                  Occasional visits of a few days to John's in Buffalo, where he went in the
                     course of a year, to other brothers' in other places, and to Julia's in another
                     large city after four or five years, did not alter matters any. The visits not
                     being of sufficient duration to fix the attention and regards of any one of
                     those whom she met and might have accepted, she was slowly drifting towards
                     Old-Maidism.
                  Ten such years to her, and then her cousin Julius, having lost one wife, came,
                     looking about in search of another to care for his motherless children. Ida,
                     now developed into one of the most splendid of women, captivated his fancy at
                     once. He offered himself. He had not inspired her love, and she didn't expect
                     he ever would, and she told him so; but, on being questioned, she further told
                     him that she did not want to live an old maid—that she regarded him kindly, and
                     was willing to unite her destiny with his. Of course they were married.
                  For the next fourteen or fifteen years until now, they have lived together,
                     honestly striving to respect, please, and make one another happy. They have
                     succeeded. Their laudable endeavors have been crowned with success. They
                        are happy. Still, Ida knows that when Julius returns from his
                     business cares and enters their pleasant home with his kindly greeting her
                     heart never leaps up to meet him with a great gladness as it might
                     if he were some other man. But, still again, she does not repine; she makes
                     herself contented caring for her two children, and for him and his children;
                     and contentment is more than half.
                  She has a more luxurious home, and rides in a somewhat better carriage than the
                     elder sister; but for the edification of those who care about such things, I
                     will say: Belle will yet ride in a nicer. She will yet reign, a queen, in
                     Washington.
               
            
            
            
               
               DIAMOND LEAVES.
               III.
               THE MANLY ART OF SELF-DEFENSE.
               
                  I.
                  I AM not one of those who believe in being too good. With the Rev. Henry Ward,
                     I believe it will be better for the honest portion of the world if the ungodly
                     are not allowed to monopolize all the good, but oftentime contemned, games.
                  Why not the athletic and active young Christian, or other young man of
                     principle, become an expert at billiards or at bowling as well as any? Can you,
                     everything considered, conjure up for him a better and more healthful
                     amusement? He certainly occasionally needs relaxation and amusement, and if he
                     hold his principles and keep his passions under control, in the main, does he
                     necessarily need abuse himself with any of the prevailing games?
                  And even, what if he does occasionally show an inclination to bet or to
                     wrangle, which is the worse: to walk in the midst of temptations, subjecting
                     his forming character to their stern tests, and perhaps now and then "slipping" a little, or to remain constantly at home under his
                     pastor's or his mother's apron strings, inert and puerile, never to get a
                     character of sufficient strength that it may be assailed?
                  Pah! What a milk-and-water sort of a world it would be without villains—if
                     there were no vice to be checked or suppressed!
                  And so too with the young Christian's belligerent propensities. It is not the
                     rough and the ruffian who alone should sit under the star, Mars. The young
                     Christian needs a little blood-letting in early youth to properly prepare him
                     to face the stern trials that await him in the future. The world is teeming with aggression.
                     There are times when the peacefully inclined must fight or must go down, unless
                     they degrade themselves with the practices of cunning, of fraud, and of
                     treachery. The rough and the ruffian will not allow peace and sweet ease.
                     Contention is one of their delights, and you know they will
                     occasionally come to your place of business, will occasionally walk in
                        your thoroughfare, and you must occasionally visit
                     their haunts. The time inevitably arrives in every young man's life when he
                     must fight or must accept insult.
                  Besides, does not the safety, the perpetuation of the human race depend on that
                     proud spirit in man which incites him to make war? How far, I wonder, is the
                     aggressive spirit which sometimes rules with the Catholic, the Methodist, etc.,
                     in the wrong? Is not this Nature's or God's method, employed to spur man into
                     the action that shall maintain his aggregate virility or vitality in
                     approximation with its maximum. Does not the preservation in its completest
                     perfection of that principle in Nature—ability to reproduce in
                     perfection—depend on the warlike element in man's nature? Most certainly.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *The interested reader is cited to my forthcoming "Famous
                        Women."
                  
                  It is well illustrated in the triumphs of nations.
                  Until the advent of the American there have never existed but three nations
                     that may be styled to have been invincible. Those nations are Greece, Rome, and
                     Great Britain. In what consisted the secret of their strength and their power,
                     do you suppose? Was it altogether in intelligence? If you haven't happened to
                     discover for yourself in your course of historical reading whether it was or
                     was not I will inform you. Those nations always and persistently, while
                     ascending on the high tide of their power and their glory, instructed their
                     people to develop muscle and sinew with "bloody sport" as well as with hard
                     grinding toil. And to-day, while she takes rank with the United States as being
                     one of the proudest nations in the world, intellectually, Great Britain
                     sedulously fosters the spirit of contention among her people while they enjoy
                     the pastimes of their elections and their holidays. This is so noticeable a
                     feature in the education of her people that it is often remarked by the
                     observing and intelligent as a blot or the fair fame of her later days—that she
                     thus, when we consider how enlightened she is and that she ought to know
                     better, disgraces her humanity. Bah! How would she replenish the ranks of her
                     ever degenerating aristocracy if she had not the "blood-thirsty" common herd
                     from which to make her ultimate drafts? Don't you suppose the conservators of
                     British power and pre-eminence understand the value of the savage portion of
                     the reprehensible moral conveyed in the lesson: "Punch and
                     Judy"?
                  It was with language similar to this that the Principal explained his views to
                     the Trustees of the Academy where Will Dimond received his education. He
                     desired to appropriate the great Recitation Hall of the building to the uses,
                     and perhaps abuses, of the "Noble Science" on every Wednesday afternoon. There
                     was a large class of the students who were eager to learn how to "box," so that
                     they might be prepared to defend themselves from maltreatment if ever menaced
                     or attacked in the future, and he was just recreant enough to the principles of
                     good order, the Trustees thought, to uphold them in their iniquity.
                  Many of the Trustees opposed the wise movement. The "prize ring" in any form,
                     however modified, they said was a disgrace to any civilized country, and its
                     abettors should be discountenanced by all members of good society. The
                     students, if allowed to practice its alluring and debasing charms, would soon
                     be wrangling and fighting in earnest. Their broils would, like the duello in
                     the German Schools, be constant, increasing in numbers, and bitter, and soon
                     there would be no peace in the community. No danger but there would be fighting
                     enough among a hundred or more rampant boys and young men constantly associated
                     together, without extending encouragement to the evil spirit.
                  The Principal of the School, supported by one of his assistants and two or
                     three of the more intelligent, progressive, of the Trustees, had many fierce
                     fights with the remainder, almost despairing at times, but finally,
                     intelligence, backed by pluck, triumphed, as it usually does in such
                     encounters.
                  The "Ring" was at last established in the venerable Hall sacred to Minerva,
                     whose walls were draped and hung with black-boards, maps, and charts, and whose
                     broad tables were graced with globes, battery, retorts, and all the numerous paraphernalia incidental to
                     the Academic curriculum. Leagued with oratory, boxing became the pastime for
                     Wednesday afternoons, and among his other numerous accomplishments the ardent
                     Will soon learned how to "hit" scientifically with his "right," and to guard
                     according to approved rule with his "left." To a youth of his temperament the
                     play was brave and royal, and therefore well-learned and intensely enjoyed.
                  The students of the Academy of course betrayed bad blood occasionally, but
                     their overseer judiciously and firmly restraining and curbing their passions,
                     no violent outbreak ever occurred.
                  With competent managers at the head the affairs of the "Ring" can be conducted
                     on gentlemanly principles as well as any other branch of business or amusement.
                     There is no particular need that those who enter its fascinating lists as
                     contestants shall "hammer away" at one another until the head and bust of one,
                     or both, be pounded to a mass of jelly, unrecognizable as belonging in the
                     ranks of the human family.
                  As intimated, Will, while at the Academy, mastered the principles of the "Noble
                     Science," and mastered them pretty effectually, as the sequel to this story
                     will inform the reader, although he did not become an adept without receiving
                     as well as giving an occasional black eye; even a tooth was occasionally
                     loosened when the play grew warm, nevertheless, the "sport" was always regarded
                     as rare by those immediately concerned.
                  And though once knocked flat on his back, when about sixteen, where he lay for
                     some time helpless and gazing stupidly up into the cerulean, discovering there
                     through the cupola, in the bright afternoon, a countless host of stars, I have
                     heard Will say that his "art" has served him so well since he came out into the
                     world he has never regretted receiving that one heavy blow.
                  So much is given as explanatory and necessary to a complete understanding of
                     the bit of very interesting adventure which succeeds.
                  When Will left the academy his education, so called, was finished. He was
                     twenty-one years old, and was, in many respects, a man. At that time his
                     physical proportions, except that he was of rather light weight and not very
                     tall, lacking some two or three inches of the height of any of his brothers,
                     would have done no discredit to the Apollo Belvidere if he had stood beside
                     that celebrated piece of sculpture.
                  He was of an independent turn; was self-reliant and resolute—emphatically
                     so—perfectly competent to take care of himself, if you waive the fact that he
                     was rather unsophisticated. He had never been out in the world, and was not
                     therefore perfectly acquainted with its ways by experience.
                  His head carried around a good heavy load of sound sense, but guileless by
                     nature, he was therefore not one of the most wary of men at his first advent
                     upon the great public arena, which now soon came to pass.
                  Though the periodicals and the conversation of his elders had acquainted him
                     with the general conduct of the various classes of which the aggregate of human
                     society is composed, he yet had no familiar conversant knowledge of their ways,
                     such as can only be gathered by personal experience in the great high ways that
                     ramify into all parts of the great social compact, and in whose travel-worn
                     paths the intercourse that fashions events is carried on.
                  In few words: Will had never been from home, and was therefore, certainly not a
                     man of the world; and now, after six months' labor on the farm since leaving
                     the Academy, about to launch out for himself into the great wilderness of life,
                     he was not quite as well prepared to distinguish between the scamp and the
                     gentleman as some veteran old campaigner may be.
                  His principles being correct, and his knowledge of what becomes the gentleman,
                     both in select society and in the world being nearly perfect in theory, he
                        supposed that with the tests he carried in his mind he could
                     readily 
                        destinguish
                        distinguish
                      him. He knew there were villains who could enact the gentleman nearly
                     to the nicest, finest lines and shades of propriety, both of act and of speech,
                     and he supposed his acquirements and native abilities were ample
                     to detect them. Well, Will was a "smart" young man as I have said,
                     nevertheless, as I have hinted, though so keen, quick-witted, and confident,
                     though so well-prepared, apparently, both by intellect and education, he still
                     did not possess the really essential qualifications that should enable him to
                        unmask the counterfeit—he had not
                     the experience, the acquired prescience, some may term it, which inevitably
                     warns the accomplished man of the world of the rascal's or the villain's
                     approach.
                  The fact established that Will's unsophisticatedness knew nothing about his own
                     imperfections in the premises, it follows as a matter of course that he must
                     learn of the world. The time had now arrived when he was to learn. How eagerly
                     he stepped forth to pluck his fate from the Future, fearing nothing, confident
                     of winning everything! How many a brave youth has entered upon life still less
                     able to take care of himself, and still as eager and as ardent to go out among
                     the thick unsuspected dangers and strive for the coveted prize.
                  Ah, Youth, and Hope, and Fortune! ye are three potent sorcerers to lure the
                     novice into thick dangers in search of his—Fate.
                  The time had arrived when Will was to leave home. His younger brother, Dewitt
                     C., had harnessed the bays to the light wagon to drive with him out to
                     Rochester where he was to take the cars at the commencement of his journey. He
                     had driven the team around to the little gate down by the road, and was there
                     waiting.
                  Will's trunk was in the wagon. The time had arrived—the time he had dreaded,
                     and yet so eagerly longed for. He must go.
                  The time to bid farewell to friends and familiar things had arrived. He swept
                     his eyes slowly around on the old familiar scenes; the sweet apple tree, the
                     clump of pear trees neighboring; opposite, the walnut, shaggy and old, the
                     peach orchard; the garden, the rambling out-buildings, all, everything shared
                     in his farewell look; he gazed out upon the verdant meadows and yellow
                     stubble-fields in the distance; the pomp and the glory*
                      of a warm, slightly hazy September morning bathed everything he looked
                     upon in a mellow, heavenly halo; as he gazed the mellow radiance seemed to
                     flood his heart with an unutterable longing to retain and carry the scene with
                     him forever; his heart embraced it with a womanish love, clinging with a
                     fidelity that could never be torn away; his eyes returned, wavering,
                     moistening, and rested on the green lawn at his feet.
                  
                     
                     *
                        How glorious none can ever know who have never beheld and
                        are never to behold the repose, the pride, and the majesty of September
                        in our Lake Region of Western New York.
                  
                  It was too much, old memories and lasting loves for the things and persons
                     about him were stirring the fountains of his affections too profoundly. He
                     could not endure it. His rising emotions would unseat his self-control. He felt
                     it as acutely as if the parting were to be final. It seemed to pierce his heart
                     like a sharp knife, and fill it with a sharp pain.
                  Hurriedly he caught little three year old Maud in his arms, hugged her to his
                     heart and kissed her, embraced his remaining brothers and sisters, turned to
                     his father and clasped his hand silently, put his arms around his mother's neck
                     and kissed her, and then, fearful of breaking down utterly, tore himself away
                     and ran and vaulted into the waiting wagon.
                  Present grief weighed heavy—almost unmanned him—but still there was a world of
                     eager hope in his heart; it triumphed.
                  What young man of twenty-one is suspicious that evil can lurk in his own
                     flowery path, ready to spring upon and crush his sweet hopes? Did you ever see
                     him springing lithely along the roadway of life, buoyant and joyous? What a
                     poem of Zion he seems to be!
                  Dewitt cracked his whip and away they went, the horses bounding along in their
                     course as if instinct with mind; the wagon bowling merry music along the hard
                     gravel, seemingly gifted in common with the horses with sentience to understand
                     the value of the precious freight they were jointly speeding away.
                  Will turned and looked back over his shoulder. It was so natural to do so; they
                     were so near, so dear. There was his favorite, Jule; she had run up stairs and
                     climbed out on the porch; she would see him, and he should see her the last of
                     any. Only she had thought of this. What an inexpressibly precious sister she
                     seemed to be to him, then.
                  Brothers and sisters, all, were waving their handkerchiefs, and the girls were
                     kissing their hands to him, O! so rapidly! God bless them! What kind, dear
                     friends, and what a happy home he was leaving!
                  The young man could not look at them long; it would unman him; he passed his
                     hand over his eyes and resolutely
                     set his face toward the city. And yet, on the last eminence, where of all the
                     old home he could look and see no lower than the top of the porch, he turned
                     once more in search of Jule; he knew she would expect it, and he would not have
                     denied her for half his brightest hopes. She caught his movement and waved her
                     final farewell; he answered it, and then—then—he bowed his face, and—Dewitt
                     lashed his horses.
               
               
                  II.
                  Bidding adieu to Dewitt in Rochester, Will entered the cars and was soon
                     speeding along among the gently swelling hills on his way to Buffalo, where his
                     "career" was to commence.
                  In those days the usual mode of traveling west from Buffalo was by boat. When
                     arrived in that city he who designed proceeding further was welcomed by the
                     captain or the civil clerk to the palace cabins of the great lake steamboat,
                     where he resided much as in an over-crowded hotel—not much seclusion for any
                     one—until he had reached Detroit, Chicago, or whatever western port was his
                     aim—Detroit usually, most travelers there taking cars again for Chicago, or
                     some locality in Michigan.
                  Such was the course that Will had decided to pursue.
                  Stepping from the train into the street on its arrival in Buffalo, he was
                     immediately accosted by a young man of very prepossessing personal appearance.
                     He was about twenty-five or twenty-six years old. His form, rising in
                     gentlemanly proportions and elegance rather above the medium height, was very
                     fine. His carriage was an exemplification of unstudied, natural grace; features
                     large, strongly marked, but regular, open, and quite pleasing; and his address,
                     as Will soon learned, was unexceptionable. His coat and all the appointments of
                     dress about him were neat, and in perfect good taste. He appeared to be
                     faultless in dress and bearing, and when he spoke his voice and language seemed
                     to diffuse around him the magic charms of gentle-manhood.
                  It was natural and easy to mistake him for a genuine Chesterfield.
                  This apparently fine young man said to Will, as soon as he had stepped from the
                     car to the walk, his tone and air easy and well-bred:
                  "Going up the lake I take it?"
                  Will leisurely surveyed the gentlemanly stranger, and, deciding that he liked
                     his appearance, answered him; but, if unsophisticated, yet not a fool to show
                     his hand unasked, he simply replied: "Yes!" and waited.
                  Handing Will his card, the young man immediately continued:
                  "Just the way I am traveling. On my way home from Old Brown where I graduated
                     last week. Been visiting The Falls a day or two. Let's join
                     together and amuse ourselves. You are a collegian are you not?"
                  Though you could not have detected in his fair countenance and blue-veined
                     temples but that half Will's time latterly had been passed in the school-room,
                     yet his hands were hard with the labor of the farm, but the young stranger had
                     not appeared to note the fact.
                  
                     Will read the address on the card: Edward P. C—s, Detroit, Mich.
                     He now looked at the young man with interest as he inquired:
                  "A son of Gen. C—s, of Detroit?"
                  "Yes, sir! I have the happiness to be his son," returned the stranger
                     quietly.
                  Will extracted a card from his memorandum book and extended it, responding
                     cordially to the other's confidence:
                  "I am not a collegian. I can claim no higher scholastic honors than those
                     awarded by the Academy. But I do not see that that need interpose as an
                     objection to our making ourselves agreeable to one another."
                  "Certainly it need not."
                  "Well, we will keep together then on the passage up the lake. I must however
                     ask you to excuse me at present as I am about to visit a brother here in the
                     city."
                  "Ah! very well! My head-quarters are at Bennett's Temperance if you are at
                     leisure and shall desire to call before the boat leaves this evening."
                  The two youths joined hands and bade one another a warm good afternoon. Yet
                     despite their apparent adieux they lingered together a few minutes longer,
                        exchanging some pleasant
                     conversation, after which they parted mutually and decidedly pleased.
                  Will informed me after he had returned from his western tour that he never had
                     a suspicion of the good faith of his pleasant acquaintance until after the very
                     last moment after they had parted in Detroit. He had never heard that Gen. C—s
                     had a son, but he thought it likely enough, and he thought nothing could be
                     more natural than that a young collegian should be bearing home his
                     commencement honors just at that particular time.
                  I dare aver to you my polished and accomplished friend of the world, that, old
                     veterans in the world as we are, in this particular instance the strongly
                     marked, but quiet, honest lines resting in such serene repose in the young
                     man's face, and his rare accomplishments, would have imposed upon even us, only
                     that we would instantly have searched our vast storehouses of knowledge and of
                     facts, and immediately have learned therefrom that Gen. C—s never had a
                     son.
                  After bidding his new found friend good afternoon Will proceeded to his brother
                     John's residence where he passed two or three pleasant hours until evening.
                     When evening had arrived he and John set out in company together to visit the
                     theatre. The elder brother's wife, feeling slightly indisposed, did not
                     accompany them.
                  Will having informed John concerning the young man who claimed kinship with
                     Gen. C—s, and that he was pleased with the acquaintance, they started early in
                     the evening and traversed a circuitous route from his residence on Delaware street on their way to the place of amusement, called at Bennett's,
                     and invited him into their company.
                  John, not much older, not long resident in the city, and therefore not yet much
                     better skilled in the exceeding nice art of reading difficult cases in human
                     nature than was Will, was soon as profoundly impressed with the apparent good
                     qualities of the young man as he had been.
                  If either had doubted his integrity of heart one little circumstance that
                     transpired during the evening would have allayed their alarms. The play that
                     evening was an old romance entitled "Love's Sacrifice." It was
                     exceeding well acted for a country place of amusement as the playhouse in
                     Buffalo would have been styled in those days. The piece was rendered with much
                     more truth and spirit than was "As You Like It" at Niblo's on
                     Broadway last winter. The actors were of superior merit to the company at Wallack's the present winter who were supposed to bring out the
                     lights and shades so finely and with such fidelity in "John
                        Garth." They were not excelled by the splendid troupe who performed
                        "The Ticket of Leave Man" so successfully in Chicago a few
                     years ago.
                  The piece was so well acted that I do not deem it any disgrace to Will's virgin
                     young manhood to say that at that particular portion of the play where the
                     heroine is overpowered with her sorrows, his fresh, untried young heart,
                     powerfully acted upon by his lively, strong imagination, spoke its lively
                     sympathy with her woes by bringing the tears into his eyes. Young people of
                     vivid imaginations and warm hearts are so prone to forget their surroundings at
                     such times, allow their whole souls to become absorbed in the play and regard
                     it as an episode just transpiring in real life.
                  John from curiosity, and he by way of asking for sympathy, both appealed to
                     their companion with their looks at the same instant. They discovered that
                        his eyes were also suffused with sympathetic tears.
                  After that, when the play was over, and John walked down to the boat in company
                     with the two, he bade his brother good-bye believing he was leaving him in
                     company with as pure-minded and warm-hearted a man as he could ever meet with
                     in this nice old world.
                  The more Will saw of him, the more he was charmed with his new found treasure
                     of a friend. He proved himself to be an infinitely congenial companion. His
                     responses to Will's generous sentiments and emotions were always delicate,
                     prompt and apparently sincere. He also possessed and skillfully used the rare
                     happy faculty to evoke the happiest of emotions and sentiments in the bosoms of
                     others. This sort of man always interests and gets the good-will of all with
                     whom he converses.
                  The scheming young C—s obtained the complete good-will of Will Dimond.
                  During the passage up the lake the two young men were very intimate and very
                     intercommunicative. They shared the same stateroom—taken, by the way, in Will's
                        name—
                     Wm. S. Dimond and Friend, it was written out in the boat's
                     registry by the happy management of the young collegian—and there, during the
                     long watches of the after part of the night, while Will was really, and his
                        friend seemingly, restless and wakeful from the novelty of the
                     situation and the monotonous, slow roll of the boat, the unprincipled
                        scoundrel adroitly drew from the lips of the simple-minded young
                     farmer nearly all his past history as well as his present plans.
                  Will talked unrestrainedly about his happy home; his labors on the farm; of the
                     many, many dear friends he had left behind; the absorbing, anxious, eager
                     emulations and strifes of his school life; of his triumphs and his aspirations;
                     and now, at twenty-one, he was carrying west to Michigan, and perhaps further,
                     a heart filled and pulsing with ardent buoyant hopes, and a pocket containing
                     five hundred dollars with which to buy him a farm.
                  He talked unrestrainedly; he was open and sincere. He felt as sure that his
                     companion was the son of Gen. C—s as he did that his brother John was a
                     gentleman.
                  And yet, Will did not tell everything. He was a little vain, and he might
                     excusably be at his age, of his scholastic attainments—of his Latin, his
                     Philosophy, and his Mathematics, but his becoming modesty kept him silent with
                     regard to the powers that existed in his solid fists.
                  Ah, Will! happy, most happy for you that you never boasted of physical powers
                     and of your consummate knowledge of the Manly Art, or this tale
                     might have had a different and very sorrowful ending.
                  To lure forth, and in return for his confidence, the accomplished young
                     hypocrite regaled Will with store of choice anecdote concerning his illustrious
                     father and his own successful college career; happily discovered that one of
                     his best friends at the university was a certain Alfred T. Dimond, a relative
                     of Will's—third cousin I believe it was, whose home was in good old
                     Massachusetts; praised the loveliness of his sister Lucy, incidentally
                     displaying a well-filled case of rare jewels that he had purchased the week
                     previous in New York and was taking home as a present to the dear girl; and
                     proved himself in a thousand ways to be a young gentleman of wealth and
                     culture, of liberal mind and warm heart, and the master of a large fund of
                     information that was very entertaining to the untraveled young farmer.
                  When morning dawned at the end of that long night, long to the one, but short
                     to the other, how well they did like one another, to be sure. How well the
                     large-minded, large-hearted young farmer and the deep-thinking, scheming,
                     deliberative young villain did like one another!
                  In the morning the exchange of confidences ended with Will's receiving a very
                     hearty invitation to accompany his new friend to his father's residence in
                     Detroit, and tarry there a short time before he should proceed to hunt up his
                     relatives in Michigan. Naturally he accepted the invitation cordially and
                     unhesitatingly. "Wouldn't you?"
                  In due season the two fine young men, both exceedingly popular with the other
                     passengers, had danced in their last set on the cabin floor of the good boat.
                     The boat herself was steaming gaily up the river, and had arrived to within
                     half a mile of her moorage. Will and young C—s, already favorites with the
                     captain, as with their fellow passengers, were, by his invitation, promenading
                     almost alone on the hurricane deck, regarding and criticising the fast
                     accumulating concourse of spectators at the landing, and indulging in other
                     talk incident to the occasion.
                  An interesting point in their conversation was reached. Forgetful, in their
                     engaged earnestness, of their walk, they had halted in close proximity to an
                     upright spar. They were absorbed in their talk and with the variety of incident
                     afforded and displayed in the movements of the fast increasing concourse of
                     expectant spectators on the wharf. Young C—s' hand, holding a white
                     handkerchief, glided, emphatic in demonstration to his companion and also as if
                     seeking rest, and to throw off the remains of a feeling of ennui which had
                     oppressed him somewhat since dinner—in other words, to half "stretch
                     himself"—young C—s' hand glided up the spar.
                  The movement was so natural and so easy—so well done, that if you had been
                     inside his mind you would have given a deep admiration to his consummate powers
                     as an actor, unless your mind had been engaged in reflecting on the awful
                     consequences the gesture portended to Will.
                  The gesture signified to his accomplices on shore that he was in company with a
                     victim, and that he was defenseless. Had the handkerchief been red, it would
                     have denoted that Will was armed; any portion black, that he was armed and not
                     afraid to defend himself.
                  
                  A minute passed. They were within twenty rods of the wharf. Their near approach
                     had distracted their thoughts from their conversation, so that it had ceased to
                     be engrossing. Will, like the inexperienced traveler that he was, or like those
                     in a hurry, remarked:
                  "We had better go below and be prepared to go ashore as soon as the bridge is
                     run out."
                  The inexperienced young man acquiesced in the good sense of his companion's
                     reply before he had ceased speaking, when he said:
                  "O, no! I always think it as well to avoid the crowd and the possible
                     pickpockets on the lower deck until I get ready to pass through, and now,
                     particularly, I feel weary enough to avoid the bustle."
                  As he ceased speaking he half yawned, and his shapely hand, as if in unison
                     with the feeling of lassitude, again slid easily up the spar, now without the
                     handkerchief, with open palm, and with four fingers and the thumb up. Five
                     hundred dollars. His accomplices, and they alone, saw and comprehended. They
                     had vigilantly noted every movement since the boat had first steamed into
                     sight. They now knew all that it was necessary for them to know, and they were
                     prepared.
                  How many a credulous simpleton has been plundered of his few hundreds with much
                     less elaborate preparation!
                  When operating in gangs, in concert of action, as they did years ago in the
                     vicinity of the lakes, and as is their usual manner everywhere, the intelligent
                     rogues husbanded their means as faithfully as the most provident. Before
                     deciding to resort to the ultimate grand coup
                        d'etat employed in their infernal trade, as they were about to do
                     in this instance, they gauged the mental powers of their victim with wonderful
                     accuracy, often from personal appearance, with sometimes a little conversation
                     added to assist, seldom erring, and employed skill accordingly.
                  Liquor, cards, and all the inferior agents and methods of robbery were employed
                     by them with success—sometimes by the masters in the trade and sometimes by the
                     apprentices, according to the intelligence of the "customer." Before stepping
                     on to the boat with him C—s knew his man. He had "taken his measure" and had
                     confidently decided that liquor, cards, &c., would be of no avail with him.
                     He had decided, too, that it would not do to place him in the hands of any
                     clumsy bungler.
                  Had Will been nothing but an ordinary man, an ordinary villain, of whom there
                     were plenty of the gang in Buffalo at the time, would have had assigned to him
                     the task of manipulating him. Perhaps he would have been plundered before
                     leaving that city.
                  The boat struck the wharf at Detroit, and the friends descended to
                     the lower deck. Having already arranged about their baggage they passed over
                     the bridge in the gangway at once, and out through the press of people, with
                     their faces to the city. They were no sooner a little outside the crowd than
                     Will linked his arm affectionately in with the arm of as talented and
                     accomplished a villain as was ever allowed to roam free in the United States—he
                     linked his arm in, ready to be conducted by his friend Edward to
                     the mansion of his father, Gen. C—s, but a few blocks away.
                  They passed through the crowd and were about to walk up the street that jutted
                     diagonally down to the wharf, when, their eyes glancing up its deserted
                     roadway, they simultaneously beheld running towards them at the top of her
                     speed, and in apparent great distress, a young and remarkably lovely girl.
                  The moment he caught sight of her graceful, willowy form, the
                        villain exclaimed, and as if involuntarily:—
                  "Why! there's Lute! What can the matter be?" and breaking away from Will on the
                     instant, he took two or three quick steps in advance, as if about to rush,
                     overjoyed, to meet her, and also to learn why she should be in the street at
                     such a time and alone; then, turning about as suddenly as he had advanced,
                     impelled as it seemed by a sudden, spurring thought of alarm, he flew almost
                     frantically in the opposite direction, calling out hurriedly as he went past
                     Will and back on to the bridge in the gangway:
                  "Heavens! what a stupid blockhead I have been. I have left Lute's box of jewels
                     in my berth entirely exposed to whomsoever chooses to take it. Just wait for me
                     one moment Dimond! I'll be back before Lute reaches you."
                  That was the last that Will Dimond ever saw of the accomplished, the generous,
                     and the warm-hearted young son of Gen. C—s.
               
               
                  
                  III.
                  The lovely young girl came running, fawn-like, swiftly down the street towards
                     the guileless Will, and was soon standing before him, nearly breathless.
                  He saw at a glance she was the sister of the young man whose arm he had so
                     recently relinquished. The resemblance was too striking to admit of a doubt,
                     though the ensemble of her charms was perfect without comprising in their
                     complement, as in the man, anything that was bold or so strikingly marked.
                  And his attention once called to her, he regarded her attentively, as he could
                     not help but do, she appeared so inexpressibly lovely in his fresh young
                     imagination, the loveliness being increased by a shade of shyness which the
                     steady, earnest look of a young man so noble and manly appearing imparted to
                     her manner. She was apparently about thirteen or fourteen years of age; her
                     complexion chaste and pure, and her graceful form dressed with refined and
                     elegant taste. The colors and arrangement of her drapery betokened that a
                     chaste mind, perhaps her own, had employed itself with the choosing and
                     fashioning. There was an air of innocence emanating from her look and attitude,
                     and from the colors and arrangement of her apparel that was very attractive.
                     Every tone about her—of dress, of action, of the shining waves of banded brown
                     hair seen under the hastily assumed bonnet, bespoke refinement, sweetness,
                     perfect purity; and when her scarlet lips parted in speech the charms of her
                     voice and language entirely confirmed the happy impression those other adjuncts
                     had made on the mind of my young hero.
                  For two or three moments before speaking she gazed around upon the crowd of
                     people on the landing with a hurried, shy, and distressed aspect of
                     countenance, seemingly in search of some particular person, not discovering
                     whom, she appeared to decide to address Will as the individual fittest and most
                     likely to give the attention she desired. Speaking, her utterance was low and
                     hurried, but the enunciations perfectly distinct and musical. The words that
                     her fragrant breath breathed close within the influence of Will's presence,
                     were:—
                  "O, Sir! Father slipped and has fallen down stairs and hurt himself very badly,
                     and he let all the servants come down here to see the boat come in, and I can't
                     see any of them in this great crowd. Won't you come and help? Please! Where's
                     Edward? I thought I saw him with you!"
                  Will answered immediately and eagerly:—That nameless charm, the thrill of
                     incipient love—the precursor of splendid hopes—shot from the central hold in
                     his heart throughout his system and betrayed itself in his tones as he
                     replied:—
                  "Yes, I'll go with you! Show me the way! Don't wait! Edward'll come
                     directly."
                  The bewitching—yes, the bewitching girl felt and understood the
                     penetrating magic in his voice. She had never heard him speak before, but she
                        felt at once she would like to have a lover, one who looked as
                     noble as he, speak to her like that all her life, still, the reserve natural to
                     her sex at such times prevented her discovering to him her reciprocating
                     thought before it was time. Instead, she yet remained obedient to the wicked
                     power that had sent her to him. Yet, the sweet magic in Will's tone did perform
                     its saving work in her heart before twenty minutes had expired, as you will
                     soon learn.
                  It takes, sometimes, but a touch, a word, a motion, a breath, to win a girl's
                     heart in an instant.
                  But at present, without making a sign to Will that should betray to him the
                     real nature of her errand, and before he had ceased speaking, the girl had
                     commenced to swiftly retrace her steps up the street whence she came. Will was
                     soon by her side, particularly eager to be of assistance to the father of so
                     beautiful a being, though I know he would have speeded on the way promptly and
                     with alacrity had it been a boy in her place. His heart was always open to the
                     calls of any suffering fellow-creature for assistance.
                  The girl ran up the street two blocks from the river, changed her course at
                     right angles and swiftly traversed three more blocks, turned again and sped a
                     distance of a few more blocks, and then turning, ascended a flight of low steps
                     to a door that served to guard the entrance into a large roomy building,
                     somewhat weatherworn in appearance and that had seen its best days. It was one
                     of those numerous, commodious
                     structures, of which there are many standing back but a little distance from
                     the river front, that were in early days an ornament to Detroit, but which have
                     since been allowed to fall into the hands of that class of people who are
                     careless of their morals, of appearances and surroundings, and who have for
                     many years been allowing them to lapse slowly into decay.
                  The building, the door of which the young girl had now reached and was about to
                     open, had all the appearance of being kept as a tavern of the third or fourth
                     rate.
                  Now, though Will Dimond was simple and sincere, he was, after all as I have
                     already more than hinted, a keen youth; his brain was of the best; there was no
                     tangle in it; it had never been muddied with tobacco, liquor, or intemperance
                     in eating, he could think rapidly and decide instantly and judiciously when his
                     suspicions were aroused, and circumstances seemed to demand.
                  You'll believe it before you have finished reading the story.
                  He now apprehended before he had put a foot on the ascending steps, that there
                     was something wrong. There was danger in store for him, and near by; he felt
                     it; he knew it.
                  There was something in the aspect of the house entirely and completely
                     incongruous with the well known character of the estimable Gen. C—s. There was
                     no possibility that a man of his tastes, habits, wealth, and well-known
                     powerful influence, morally, socially, and politically, would reside in so
                     shabby a place—and particularly a place that had all the appearance of being
                     kept as a public house.
                  Then why should the girl have brought him there? There could be but one answer,
                     and that answer was plain. It was: as Will decided it after he had completed
                     his mental process:
                  "Certainly, not for my own good."
                  He felt and knew there was danger for him lurking within those neglected,
                     somber walls. And so, when you learn what he did, you must remember he was
                     young, he was fearless, he was just of that disposition which relishes
                     adventure spiced with a bit of danger, and too, reader, won't you excuse him? I
                     guess you will when you learn how circumspect he became before the close of the
                     evening—and too, more than all, he liked the girl's looks. Still, he did not
                     enter the den without an attempt at parley. Before the charmer had opened the
                     door, the lock of which her hand had just reached, Will queried kindly, though
                     not now with the lover's tone:
                  "Is this the place? Is this your father's house?"
                  The girl replied hurriedly and Will thought a little fearfully:
                  "Yes, this is the place. We must be quick!" and not yet having shaken off the
                     shackles imposed by the old, wicked power that ruled her—though there was now a
                     hesitation in her mind that had not been there at the wharf—she opened the door
                     and went in.
                  Will has since said that after receiving the girl's answer he was still as
                     confident of danger ahead as he had been at any time; still, he could not do
                     otherwise than strive to reconcile incongruities with his prepossessions—he
                     could not divest his mind of the thought that a girl with such a face, such a
                        look and air as she carried about with her, would not betray
                     him to harm.
                  The able young villain had now, as often before, calculated to the most perfect
                     nicety on the attractions of his lovely young sister. But! my friend! he had
                     not calculated so accurately on the young man's ability to strike a good blow
                     for himself and on his manly attractions and the consequences they might
                     precipitate in his behalf. This truth you will find disclosed in the
                     sequel.
                  The scheming villain won at the commencement of his game, for, when the girl
                     had opened the door and entered the house, Will had decided and had followed
                     her close. As to whether he prospered to the end, I will say, please read and
                     learn how Will emerges from the man-trap, and whom he takes with him.
               
               
                  IV.
                  The room the venturesome young man entered in company with the enticing girl,
                     was a long, broad, spacious hall, destitute of life save themselves. The girl,
                     scarce a step in advance, tripped lightly up half its extent until near its center, when, diverging, she opened
                     a door at the side and passed through.
                  Will also stepped out of the hall nearly as soon as she, following into the
                     room where she had led. He has since said that his object in following her so
                     close was to get some more talk with her. He had now no faith in the statement
                     she had made at the landing, but her beauty, and those indescribable charms
                     which native goodness can alone diffuse about the person, had made their
                     impression on his susceptible heart. Without really anticipating what it might
                     result in, he meant to know more about her before she went beyond his
                     reach.
                  So, in pursuance of this purpose, he had followed her close. As he stepped over
                     the threshold into the room adjoining the hall, he advanced three or four paces
                     into the room, instantly. He had perceived a man, partly hidden, with his back
                     close up to the wall, and his person close by the entrance, standing as if on
                     guard, and Will, not to be caught, therefore passed him quickly. As he passed,
                     this man reached out his hand without delay, caught the door, swung it closed,
                     turned the key, drew it from the lock, and inserted it in a tight pocket on his
                     person.
                  This man was about thirty years of age; of sinister aspect; large and heavy,
                     but compactly built; an apparent Hercules. There were also sitting on the
                     further side of the room, in various attitudes, three other men of iron frames;
                     of large, hard, and strong sinews, and large, heavy bunches of muscle. Will was
                     a pretty good judge of the physical man from outward appearances, and could see
                     and understand that much about them pretty plainly. He also saw that their
                     countenances were forbidding—that the situation they occupied, and their looks
                     and bearing proclaimed them to be, what they were—desperadoes.
                  He had left the society of the polished, gentlemanly villain, who seldom struck
                     a blow, only to get a close introduction to the thorough-going ruffian. He
                     comprehended his situation at once. He looked, he saw, and he comprehended that
                     if he opposed them they were prepared to undertake to extinguish his fire of
                     life. Perhaps they would attempt it in any event.
                  Did he fear them? No! Strange as it may seem to nearly every man on the face of
                     the earth, this graceful Will Dimond, entirely unarmed, laughed them all to
                     scorn in his secret heart, though he did not let his emotions become manifest.
                     He did not fear them in the least. He had learned what cunning and power there
                     were resident in his good, solid fists, from too many encounters with men who
                     were as good as they in every respect.
                  On first entering the room where the ruffians were, his vision had swept its
                     circumference in an instant. It was very large, and almost entirely
                     unencumbered with furniture. With the appliances of shutters, curtains, etc.,
                     etc., at the windows, it had been made nearly impervious to light and sound
                     from the outside, while within it was lighted by two or three cut glass lamps
                     standing on a table near the three ruffians who were seated on chairs. A heavy
                     carpet on the floor, two or three more chairs on the side of the room next to
                     himself, and a naked feather bed lying on the floor in one corner completed the
                     furniture.
                  The bed was used to smother the cries of refractory victims, and when employed
                     was seldom unrolled from the suffering victim's head until death had released
                     him from his agonies. Offensive weapons of war of all kinds—knives, pistols,
                     etc., etc., were rigidly ruled from the room on all occasions like the present.
                     Blood leaves traces not easily removed and must never be spilled.
                  Will saw clearly that a deadly struggle was impending. He did not once think of
                     submitting tamely. One thought passed swiftly through his mind with regard to
                     his means of defense. He had nothing with him but such weapons as Nature had
                     furnished. On these therefore, and on his ready wit, he must rely. He believed
                     them to be sufficient. He had a couple of pistols, but never having indulged a
                     suspicion that he might need to use them before passing through Michigan, they
                     were safely locked in his trunk, and were doubtless at this very instant being
                     hoisted into an express wagon for Johnson's Hotel.
                  But the situation, though apparently desperate, did not, as I have said, daunt
                     him in the least. He believed himself to be superior to it. He accepted it with
                     a serene mind, and accepting it, his next thought was to retain his
                     self-possession and be prepared to defend himself as becomes a man when
                     attacked.
                  These thoughts passed through his mind with great rapidity. While the principal
                     ruffian was locking the door and
                     disposing of the key, Will had advanced to one of the chairs near by the door,
                     had coolly seated himself, had unconcernedly surveyed his surroundings, had
                     deduced his conclusions, and now understood his position.
                  He knew what to expect. They could not surprise him; and not to be surprised is
                     sometimes nine-tenths of the battle gained before a blow is struck.
                  The big, burly villain standing within eight feet of him, misinterpreting
                     Will's movement of taking the chair, smiled a peculiar, wicked smile as he saw
                     him seat himself in it and complacently survey the scene. The victim's serenity
                     of manner prompted him to startle him by letting a little light into his mind
                     at once with regard to his situation, though they usually waited until the
                     decoy had passed through the room before commencing. Without moving in his
                     tracks he now spoke in a hard, sarcastic tone, commanding:
                  "Now then, youngster, fork over that five hundred just as quick as you can. The
                     sooner it is done the better it will be for you."
                  Will was a young man possessing marvellous powers of nerve. He surveyed the
                     villain steadily, not deigning to comply with his demand, querying in reply
                     with a voice that had not a tremor in its tone:
                  "And what then?"
                  "God damn y'u!—we don't want any of your jaw; no dilly-dallying here. Come!
                     pull it out quick, I say."
                  Will spoke with low, even tones:
                  "I intend to leave this house within five minutes, and with all that I brought
                     in with me."
                  The ruffian exploded with a horrid oath. He began to work himself into a fierce
                     passion preparatory to action, but was yet standing near the door. The
                     assistant villains, fifteen feet distant, had risen. Two of them were prepared
                     to advance, but appeared to await the motion of him who had spoken; the other
                     was already moving toward the bed in the corner.
                  The sweet young thing who had inveigled the young man into his present perilous
                     situation had had time to cross the room diagonally to a door in the far end;
                     she had turned the key in its lock and was about to pass out. Will, seeing her
                     movement before he had completed his reply to the ruffian, now instantly turned
                     his attention to her. He felt he could not let her pass beyond his influence
                     until he had said something to her. What, he hardly knew, but he believed in
                     her yet. He spoke. His voice, still modulated on a low key, was yet firm, and
                     now authoritative:
                  "Stop there! Lucy, I think it is they call you; come back here. I have
                     something to say to you before we part."
                  The girl did not hesitate nor waver an instant; she, too, had been thinking.
                     Will's tone at the landing had now begun to tell
                     effectively. That tone, combined with the augury of truth and
                     power she discovered in his present speech, influenced her mightily. She felt
                     glad that that voice had commanded her; she felt happy to obey it—happy, even
                     though she believed its owner to be in the extremest peril. She, too, wanted to
                     know more of him, as he of her.
                  She turned about instantly and glided straight, silent, and swift as light over
                     the thick carpet, towards him. There was a storm of grief, anguish, and pity,
                     mingled with despair, sweeping over her fair young face as she approached.
                  The ruffian, catching the expression in the troubled face with his eye, and
                     correctly interpreting it, ground out with terrible and significant emphasis
                     from between his teeth:
                  "Come! By God, Lute, don't let's have any more of that nonsense here. You've
                     tried it on once before, and found it didn't work. So, God damn y'u, keep
                     still!"
                  Without pausing in her course the girl flashed back a look of defiance, and
                     replied:
                  "You wouldn't dare to speak to me like that if Edward were here."
                  The next moment she had flung an arm around Will's neck and was hurriedly
                     whispering in his ear:
                  "O believe me! I was compelled to bring you here. Give them your money and
                     promise to be silent, or they will kill you. They know exactly how much you
                     have. O do heed me!"
                  Her whisper was pathetic with the most earnest tone of entreaty.
                  Returning now to the ruffian: The girl's reply to him appeared to stagger him
                     for the instant, but only for the moment during which she was whispering to
                     Will, when he was springing vengefully toward the young couple. Will, on his guard, was up in a flash, had
                     taken the girl by the arms and seated her in his place, rewarding her for her
                     friendly advice, only with saying—he had not time to say more—
                  "Sit there! Don't endanger me by getting up."
                  Before proceeding further with the narration of this thrilling adventure of
                     Will's, I may as well state boldly, what the reader cannot but have perceived,
                     that the girl was "falling in love" with Will with considerable expedition. The
                     word, the tone, and the look were already beginning to powerfully
                     affect her. And his manliness of bearing, his fearlessness, his Apollo-like
                     beauty and strength, his refinement and evident goodness, so different and so
                     superior to many of the associations by which she was, and always had been
                     surrounded, were also making their vivid and lasting impression on a young
                     heart which had not yet been deflowered. Such impressions strike deeply in
                     congenial soil, and sometimes sway powerfully. Falling like sweet manna on the
                     pure female heart, they are the germs whence springs happy,
                     nourishing love; a passion experienced in its first inception by many, but in
                     its fullest fruition by but few.
                  But though the girl was learning to love Will so fast, she yet had not betrayed
                     herself. The caress that her arm gave when she flung it about him had no harm
                     in it. It was pure as if given by a vestal. Though love was born in her heart,
                     she was not yet awake to the fact; had she been, I know her arm would have been
                     withheld just at present. Half the reason why she put that arm
                     about him was that it was in involuntary expression of her desire to shield
                     from harm, in the same spirit that she would have acted toward her brother, or
                     a sister, if either had been similarly situated. The other half of the reason
                     is chargeable to the loose state of morals of the society amid which she had
                     moved, more or less of her time. Many of the associations amid which she had
                     grown up were so different to those which surrounded our childhood, kind
                     reader. The habitual witness of improper conduct had invited her to imitate,
                     without informing her of the impropriety. She was as yet, in many respects,
                     what may be termed an unconscious, or, a sinless sinner.
                  Certainly, the society amid which she was living was doing its wicked work—was
                     defacing the innate moral beauty that God had implanted within her, but she was
                     not yet entirely fallen; or rather, the early blight of sin had not yet seared
                     her soul so completely that it was incapable of unfolding into purity and
                     beauty.
                  It was the God-given human pity, joining, unknown to her, fraternally with the
                     beautiful, up-springing love that had commenced to well up sweet in her young
                     heart, that charged her at the eleventh hour to adventure something to
                     frustrate the plans of the remorseless wretches who now appeared to have Will
                     in their toils—something to avert the dreadful fate that was so imminently
                     menacing him.
                  There was yet a great deal of good in her.
                  God pity that woman, I say—for she is surely lost—who can
                     premeditatedly and unpityingly lure manly strength and innocence to their sure
                     destruction.
                  But the late awakening of love and generous charity in the girl's heart came
                     near precipitating the terrible catastrophe that she dreaded.
                  Will had barely time to rise from his chair, take her by the arms, and
                     necessarily rather roughly seat her in his place—he was obliged to be so quick
                     about it—when the burly, heavy ruffian, now fearfully maddened by his calmness
                     and the tenderness of the girl's manner toward him—her evident desire to
                     befriend the victim, was rushing close upon them with all the terrible tiger in
                     his bad heart aroused.
                  Will sprang aside two steps with the celerity of the swift wind, and, as the
                     raging fiend passed through, clutching the air close by the chair where he
                        had been, his clenched hand shot straight out, like a bolt of
                     wrath, as it was, and hit the villain hard in the temple. Will weighed only a
                     hundred and fifty-three, but when he struck he was pitching forward on his
                     toes, so that the whole of that hundred and fifty-three went with incredible
                     velocity with the blow.
                  The ruffian dropped to the floor like an ox felled with a steel hammer. His
                     body rolled over like a log, senseless. He did not exhibit a sign of life
                     afterward while Will was in the room. He never learned whether he killed him.
                     When a man like Will, blessed with great muscular power, and who also
                     understands the Science of Striking, strikes another, hitting fair, at the full
                     length of the arm, it is much as if
                     he hit with a chunk of iron at the extremity of that arm.
                  Two others of the villains were now half-way across the room to him, the fourth
                     lifting the bed of feathers as the first fell.
                  On the two came, like a tornado, at about four feet apart, their eyes glaring
                     balefully in the lamplight upon the young hero. Together they made the vicious
                     rush; their intent deadly; bent on his destruction. With a light, quick bound
                     he again sprang out from the clutch, and aside, just as it was prepared to
                     fasten upon him.
                  Will did not strike this time. He saw that his assailants, having marked the
                     effects of his first ruining blow, were on their guard and might dodge and
                     escape if he should, so he allowed them both to shoot by unharmed. But they,
                     having passed, immediately checked their impetus and turned to grapple with
                     him. Quick as a thought, when they had turned, he bent swiftly down, rested his
                     hands on the floor and threw his feet lightly into the air in the direction of
                     the oncoming desperadoes. Before those feet, thus singularly elevated, had
                     commenced to descend in accordance with natural laws, he drew his body down
                     toward his hands, his chest resting nearly on the floor, and his knees bending
                     in unison. The next instant the feet went plunging with unerring precision and
                     terrible force into the lower extremity of the stomach of one of his foes. The
                     foe saw the swift-coming feet before they struck him, but not in time to veer
                     in his course or to check his advance. He received the blow fair and square in
                     the most vulnerable part of the body where a man can be hit by that sort of
                     blow.
                  The blow was tremendous—it was awful. Will learned the trick in his boyish days
                     of a little Norwegian in the Old District School-House, and had practiced it
                     while a boy until he knew just where and how hard he could hit. Not a very
                     dignified manner of fighting, certainly, but then, you know when a man's life
                     is in imminent peril, polite people even do not require that he
                     shall be choice in his methods of attack and defense.
                  That awful quieting blow from Will's feet sent the second villain straight past
                     the chair where the girl was quietly sitting in obedience to his desire, and
                     was contemplating the progress of these stirring events with a very interested
                     and absorbed air, to the wall of the room some five feet distant, where his now
                     inert body struck with immense force and fell heavily to the floor, a collapsed
                     mass of nerveless flesh and bones. Will did not see him stir again
                     while he was in that house.
                  His novel and peculiar change of tactics so astonished and disconcerted the
                     third villain, for the moment, that Will was up on his feet and facing him
                     "before the wretch knew what he was about."
                  Will's task was now an easy one, particularly as his blood was up. He quickly
                     "planted his left" soundingly in the chest of the third ruffian, followed in
                     about four seconds by the "right" striking sharp and heavy between the eyes and
                     his third enemy tumbled backward and was soon sprawling.
                  You may be sure Will had not hit three men so hard without getting warm. He
                     was, indeed, awfully angry—the term "mad" will better express his state of
                     mind—when the third villain fell.
                  His eyes blazed fire, and there was a fierce, terrible passion of wrath filling
                     his face when he turned to the fourth villain who had dropped the bed within a
                     few feet and was about to spring upon him. Though not so very tall his form now
                     swelled and towered into grand height with its awful rage—rage the most awful
                     that can exercise the human heart, because just.
                  He commanded, his voice thundering forth in low, deep, heavy tones—you
                     sometimes hear such reverberations from the storm-cloud when the Omnipotent
                     sends them forth premonitions of the infinite power held in abeyance—you
                     sometimes hear such from the storm-cloud, only they are far off and this was
                     near—Will commanded in awful anger:
                  "Stay where you are unless you want to die; for as sure as God rules I will
                        kill if attacked again."
                  The third villain had now risen to a sitting position and was inclined to get
                     on his feet. Will turned his terrible voice on him:
                  "You needn't get up."
                  Both wretches remained as commanded. Not because they feared him;
                     they were not cowards; there was not a coward in the room; but because they comprehended the utter uselessness of
                     making any further demonstration; they knew now that if he chose
                     to harm them they were entirely powerless to retaliate. They had learned that
                     his Science was superior to their brute strength, and that he would certainly
                     foil them if they should attempt to molest him further, and as certainly punish
                     them if they should disobey him; and truly, Will could have knocked down an
                     army of such men before tiring, if he could have met them, not more than two at
                     once—if he could have kept them all at his face.
                  The conqueror now stepped before the girl he had seated so unceremoniously in
                     the chair, and who had sat there faithful to his desire during the fight,
                     addressing her in tones that he managed to soften, perceptibly, from their
                     recent warlike harshness; his manner gracious and kind, as now became him. He
                     said, opening his heart at once:
                  "Do you wish to change your present mode of life?"
                  She sprang to her feet instantly, exclaiming with those notes of genuine
                     gladness which so unerringly betoken a new-born joyous hope springing into
                     existence in the youthful soul:
                  "Yes! O yes!"
                  "Come with me then," continued the young man, briefly, and, stooping, he
                     extracted the door-key from the pocket of the senseless ruffian whom he had
                     first subdued with his scientific skill, and with it in his hand proceeded to
                     the door at which he had entered the room.
                  The girl hesitated, which Will remarking, he added:
                  "You must trust me. There is no other way. How else can you leave your old
                     associates? But I cannot explain in presence of these ruffians. Don't you
                     see!"
                  His language was eager and persuasive; he liked her appearance very much
                     indeed; her manner had convinced him that she was a good girl at the bottom of
                     her heart; he wanted her to come, but he did not hesitate in his movements; he
                     knew it would do no good to wait; he unlocked the door and repassed into the
                     hall.
                  Without pausing he returned direct to the outer door. When he had reached there
                     the girl was standing close by his side. His language had had the desired
                     effect. Her faith in him had become great, and she really did want to associate
                     with respectable people.
                  She stood close by him; so close that their garments touched.
                  She breathed close to him—not whispered—so low and shy that he scarce detected
                     and gathered the sense of her aspirations:
                  "I trust you. I will go with you. But O! you must not deceive me."
                  Will responded:
                  "Whatever I may do, I shall never betray your confidence in me."
                  He raised his hand to the latch of the street door. The door was fast locked.
                     The girl produced a key from the folds of her dress and unlocked it,
                     remarking:
                  "I believe you can do almost anything. I believe you could get out of this
                     house without my assistance, but you would require some time."
                  Will smiled as he replied:
                  "If you were not here I should make a hole through that door in less than three
                     minutes, if not molested."
                  The door was thick and strong, and his speech surprised the girl. Was he
                     bantering her? Her people often talked so.
                  She looked into the man's smiling face searchingly. It was full of life and
                     hope, truth and confidence. She believed him. She assented with great
                     admiration:
                  "Yes you could and you would, but I don't know how."
                  Will explained:
                  "There are some immensely heavy andirons in the fireplace of the room we have
                     just left. I could soon get one and throw it through the door. It would not
                     require many blows to knock out one of those panels, heavy as they are.
                  A happy smile illumined the girl's face. She was well pleased with this new
                     manifestation that her hero—he was fast becoming the one only hero to her
                     heart—possessed such keen observant faculties and such ready wit. She responded
                     with increasing admiration:
                  "I believe I am a simple girl after all, and yet they all seem to think Edward
                     and I are so smart. Edward, particularly, has said many times that no other
                     girl could do as well for them as I have done. Do you think they have talked to
                     me as they have in order to flatter me and keep me reconciled with their mode
                     of life?"
                  
                  "Yes, without doubt that has been partly their object."
                  "I have thought so sometimes; they know very well that I have never been
                     willing to serve as their decoy."
                  She opened the door, flung it wide—there was a deep significance in the
                     action—and together, side by side, they stepped over the threshold into the
                     street.
                  The girl led him to the house of evil, to what she feared might end in robbery
                     and murder; the compassionate man led her away to virtue, a useful life,
                     contentment, and everlasting happiness.
               
               
                  V.
                  Will did not communicate with the police after he had gained his liberty, as
                     you would naturally suppose he should have done. He already held in his sound
                     brain a hastily devised plan for the girl's removal from among her old
                     associates, and consequently for her safety, that would not permit it. He knew
                     that a girl of as much beauty, intelligence, and consequence to the gang of
                     robbers as was she, must be sequestered from their knowledge most completely if
                     she were to be kept from them. Even should they be willing to dispense with her
                     valuable services, she knew too many of their dangerous secrets, too many of
                     their favorite haunts, and too many of their numbers personally, to be allowed
                     to depart from among them. She possessed the knowledge requisite to imprison
                     fifty men, and probably clues enough, if followed up, to lead to the detection
                     of half a dozen murders. It was plain: even her brother's influence, powerful
                     as it might be, could not save her from the pursuit of the gang if she should
                     leave them for honest folks—could not save her if they should know of her
                     whereabouts. They would reason that their own liberty would depend on her
                     silence, and of that, so long as she should be alive, they could only be sure
                     as her masters.
                  And further, Will reasoned that if he should use the present opportunity and
                     prompt the girl who had just given herself to him so trustfully to deliver any,
                     or one of them, to the law, their vengeance would be sure and deadly—only the
                     more sure and the more deadly; their hate would be tireless and implacable
                     until they should have destroyed her.
                  Will had revolved all this in his mind very rapidly, judging from what he had
                     seen and heard that such would be the state of the case in the contingencies
                     indicated. He was correct, and hence by not giving publicity to their late
                     attempt on his life, but by taking measures at once to secrete the girl from
                     their knowledge, he secured to her an eventual happy fate, however much he may
                     have cheated, or betrayed, the ends of justice.
                  His first movement when in the street was to hasten to the steamboat landing
                     whence he had been lured. He thought he might yet proceed from there to a hotel
                     in the usual way. He was again correct. There were yet two or three coaches in
                     waiting. He entered one of them with his companion and directed the driver to
                     proceed to the Michigan Exchange.
                  While in Buffalo he had been advised by John to visit Johnson's if he should
                     need to stop in Detroit, and he would now have done so had not the new
                     responsibilities incurred necessitated plans that he deemed could be best
                     prospered if he should seek seclusion among the more numerous company of guests
                     who were usually thronging the parlors of the more commodious and roomy Exchange.
                  Riding luxuriously along on the way to the hotel, Will's thoughts naturally
                     reverted to the house he had just escaped. There were one or two singularities
                     about the old trap that somewhat surprised him. If the house was kept as a
                     hotel, as to all appearances it was, where were the guests and other occupants?
                     He referred to the girl to clear up the mystery.
                  She informed him that the house was kept as a hotel, but was managed
                     exclusively by members of the gang to which her brother belonged, and by whom
                     he was regarded as a leader, and much respected for his courage and abilities.
                     She said that all, excepting those who were immediately concerned in the
                     execution of the desperate plot, made a point to be away when, once in a long
                     while, as to-day for instance, it was to be used for purposes of robbery.
                     To-day there was but one other person in the house, excepting those he saw,
                     when he was attacked. That other person was a trusty old hag, who had locked
                     the street door behind them after they had passed through the hall.
                  
                  "If I had not come with you, I should," said the girl, looking at him timidly,
                     the life she had lived being considered, "have unlocked the entrance door for
                     you at all hazards to myself after you had beaten those four terrible men."
                  She spoke from the depths of her kind heart now, and Will knew it and believed
                     her. Her voice was a little sad. He replied to her assuringly:
                  "There was but little danger. I regard myself as a match for almost any two men
                     on the face of the earth," he laughed; continuing, "I have a brother-in-law
                     named Ingoldsby, who is as strong as any two of those men combined. I could
                     knock him down almost as easily as I can a fourteen year old boy."
                  "But what if they had been armed?"
                  "Ah! then I might have required more than five minutes to get away, and perhaps
                     I never should have escaped them. But they were not armed, and I saw from
                     appearances they were not likely to be, almost as soon as I had entered among
                     them. I imagined what the feather bed was for almost as soon as my eyes rested
                     on it, and judged that men who should desire to resort to its use had not,
                     probably, provided themselves with deadly weapons."
                  "You are a brave man, and you think of everything," now again admiringly said
                     the girl.
                  After this piece of explanation from Will, which elicited such a choice bit of
                     encomium from his young companion, she further stated in reply to his
                     questioning and in response to his original interrogatory in reference to the
                     house, that, usually, the guests of the house were principally of the same
                     character as the management. There were only three or four visiting the home
                     to-day who were not of that class, and they had all gone to see the boat come
                     in, excepting one who had either gone voluntarily or had been enticed in
                     another direction, she did not know which. Had the respectable element been too
                     numerous in the house at the time, the gang had two or three other inferior,
                     but perhaps safer, places to which he might have been conducted.
                  "You would," said she, her tone again saddening, though she also seemed to be
                     half pleased, "have followed me anywhere."
                  "Yes," replied Will, "I believed there was good in you, and I would have
                     followed you into the nether regions unless I had sooner learned something
                     desperately to the contrary. I liked your appearance very much, and I desired
                     much to learn more about you."
                  Entirely candid and committal on Will's part! Wasn't it?
                  The girl responded: her tone was really mournful now:
                  "Yes, that has always been the way with all of them; but I fear all have not
                     followed me with as good a motive as that which actuated you."
                  "What!" said Will quickly, "I do not comprehend, do I? What but a good motive
                     could urge a man forward to the assistance of a suffering fellow-being?"
                  "Ah!" said she, averting her face in shame, "Edward has not put the same words
                     in my mouth on every occasion. Sometimes I have decoyed their victim with one
                     pretext and sometimes with another. I received the sign to-day while running
                     down to the wharf what to say to you," and the tears sprang into
                     her eyes.
                  Will said something befitting and consoling.
                  The girl then completed her statement with saying that the room to which she
                     had conducted him probably now wore an entirely different aspect to what it had
                     fifteen minutes previously. It was now probably well filled with decent
                     furniture, was thrown open to the light of day, and was wearing all the
                     appearances of a cheerful back-with-drawing-room. There could not now,
                     probably, be a sign discovered inside the house but what denoted fair
                     respectability at least. Doubtless, also, it had now a share of guests from the
                     very boat which had just arrived—guests brought in in one of the coaches
                     belonging to the gang, which had reached the house after a roundabout course of
                     travel, after dropping other persons at other of their dens, and after giving
                     the four ruffians who had Will in hand time to dispose of him.
                  "Edward has told me a great deal, and besides, I have learned a great deal for
                     myself," concluded the girl.
                  Will queried:—
                  "Do you reside there?"
                  "O, no!" she replied, "Edward and I live by ourselves in one of the most
                     respectable parts of the city, but," and she sighed, "I have been in such
                     places and among such men a great many times. Sometimes for many days in
                        succession Edward has sent me on
                     errands to such men in such places. I thank him sincerely that he has always
                     been a good brother to me in this respect, never sending me to meet any of them
                     except in public places."
                  "Has your home been always in this city?"
                  "No! we have been here less than a year. We have lived in Baltimore, New York,
                     Philadelphia, and many other places, but always leading the same life; yet,
                     though we have been robbers ever since I can remember, I have never suspected
                     that they murdered until very lately. If you had let me pass through the room
                     to-day I should have watched for you afterwards, and if you had never made your
                     reappearance they might have killed me sooner than I would have decoyed another
                     young man into their power. I am not bad! Indeed! indeed! I am not!" besought
                     she looking at Will appealingly.
                  "No!" said Will, "you are not a bad girl! I believe you will live to be a good,
                     noble woman."
                  She was gratified and satisfied with his words.
                  The coach had now arrived at the Exchange. They alighted. Will
                     handed the coachman his fare and dismissed him, escorted his fair charge to a
                     ladies' parlor, visited the clerk's office, recorded his arrival as Wm. S.
                     Dimond and Sister, and ordered a private parlor and two night-rooms
                     prepared.
                  Then returning to the young girl, a maid conducted the two to the desired
                     parlor; doubtless thinking that as the girl was so young there were other
                     ladies of the party who had charge of basket, shawl, and other et cæteras of
                     that description, or that, as the weather was so warm she had taken the
                     precaution to secure everything in her trunk before leaving the boat, thus
                     relieving herself of all trouble-some encumbrances;—doubtless the maid thought
                     thus, for she conducted the two to the desired parlor without remark at the
                     time, or afterwards; and now they were really alone together for the first
                     time.
                  Will spoke directly:—
                  "There is no time to spare; we must act; and first I must know your name and
                     age. This may be necessary knowledge to me in case some future circumstance
                     adverse to your welfare shall arise."
                  
                     The girl:—Responding promptly—"I am Lucy V.C—s."
                  
                     Will:—"What! you are not, really, as your brother claimed, a
                     relative of Gen. C—s of this city?"
                  
                     Lucy:—"No, not that I know."
                  
                     Will:—"Certainly not! Am I becoming stupid? Of course it is
                     absurd in me to think it now; but your age?"
                  
                     Lucy:—Blushing for the first time in her life—"I am just
                     fourteen."
                  
                     Will:—"Well, Lucy, as I have said, there is no time to spare.
                     What is to be done must be done quickly. And so, to commence:—If you are to
                     leave this city with me tomorrow morning on the cars, you must first promise me
                     never to again see one of your old associates.
                  
                     Lucy:—Startled—"What! not see Edward?"
                  
                     Will:—Decisively—"No! not one of them, not even Edward!"
                  
                     Lucy:—"O! can I leave Edward never to see him again? He is the
                     only relative, the only friend I have ever had in the world. Though he has made
                     me assist in his plans of robbery yet he has always, and many and many a time
                     saved me from greater harm. He has always been kind to me, never severe, unless
                     when I have rebelled to filling the place he has assigned to me in his schemes.
                     Can I never see him?"
                  Her appeal was pathetic. She had not anticipated total separation from her
                     brother. There was a storm of grief swept through her heart and surged out over
                     her countenance. The girl was sorely afflicted. The old love, natural
                     affection, was battling fiercely with the delicious new, joined to which was
                     another hope nearly as bright—the desire to attain respectability. Should she
                     stay with Edward, a known and dear friend, but one whose life daily embraced
                     infamy; or, should she accept an honest life and perhaps Will in
                     the future? She thought it thus; he had been so very kind in manner so far.
                  Will, commiserating her grief, answered more kindly than he had yet spoken,
                     though his tone and manner also evinced great firmness of purpose. He
                     replied:
                  "No, you must never see him; at least not for a great many years. Listen to me,
                     Lucy! The associations he has thrust you among have brought the very dangers
                     upon you in the past from which you have said he has so often saved you. This,
                     together with what I have learned within the past hour convinces me he is thoroughly and
                     irredeemably unprincipled. He will never get a footing in good society except
                     by fraud; nor will he allow you. And if he or any of his associates know where
                     you are they will allow you no rest unless you are again of them or in the
                     grave. They will hunt you until they kill you, or until they secure your
                     presence again among them; he most of any; and having secured, will use you
                     until you are ruined. Why! I can apprehend that, young as you are, you have
                     already brought in many thousands of dollars to the band, and you have informed
                     me that you are deep in their secrets. No! no! Lucy! there is no
                     safety for you for many years to come, except in perfect seclusion from their
                     knowledge. Even the law would be impotent to protect you unless you be
                     constantly guarded, and probably not then."
                  
                     Lucy:—"You are right. I feel it. I know it. But oh! it is so hard
                     to give up my brother. I never had anybody else to love," and she burst into a
                     paroxysm of tears.
                  Will was powerfully moved. He was a young man of quick sympathies and capable
                     of intense feeling, and hence, though not yet actually in love, he thought to
                     administer consolation. He said to her very tenderly:—
                  "Lucy, listen again! I am a man who can hold my passions and emotions amenable
                     to my reason, and I always intend to thus hold them. I always try to speak the
                     truth; therefore what I am about to say to you you can implicitly rely on, and
                     also believe that I sincerely desire that everything that I tell you that
                     depends on contingencies may come true."
                  Lucy sat so still you might have thought her an image carved in marble. She did
                     not seem to breathe. It was the young man's manner that impressed her more
                     particularly than the words, though they also seemed to her to be freighted
                     with something of immense consequence. She felt in her innermost soul that he
                     was about to say something of vast consequence to her welfare. She could not
                     have stirred before he finished speaking if she had tried.
                  He continued impressively:
                  "I have never liked any other girl so well as I like you. Foolish as it may
                     seem for such brief acquaintance, I like you very much indeed. I design taking
                     you with me, proceeding directly to Illinois and placing you under the
                     supervision of a respected aunt of mine who resides in D—, in that State"—he
                     named a thriving village located in the Great Western Garden, since grown into
                     a flourishing city—"where I shall desire you to remain for three years. And if
                     during that time you shall succeed in abjuring all old, wretched associations,
                     I promise you that I can, and will, love you, and marry you, if you shall
                     desire. I know, because—because"—and his fine eyes moistened; the great big
                     warm heart was fighting at a great rate with his boasted powers of will and of
                     reason—"I know, because I want to love you now; but I will not entrust my
                     happiness to the keeping of so young a girl, and one, too, who has lived the
                     life that you have. I must, and will, first have some enduring proof of
                     constancy in good purposes."
                  Lucy rose from the sofa where she was sitting and went and stood facing him.
                     Her soul was in a tumult of delight. The young man had offered her that which
                     she regarded at the time as the Supreme Good. The offer, too, had come from the
                     only young man in all the world from whom she could have desired it. It
                     affected her powerfully, making her supremely happy. She did not doubt in the
                     least her ability to live as he desired. Her heart had instantly and
                     confidently said: "He is mine, and I am his." Nor did she doubt but that he had
                     spoken the utterest truth of his heart. Yet the old habit of distrust she had
                     learned of the deceitful, treacherous people among whom she had always lived
                     made her get up and go and face him. She could not be quite satisfied that the
                     great, good promise just given her could be quite true until she had made
                     assurance doubly sure. Could it really be that he was sincere? Had he really
                     offered a poor, outcast girl so much, and all for nothing? She would be sure,
                     and thought she could tell.
                  She came and stood close before him. Her eyes sought his gratefully. Gratitude
                     and love shone from them as from heavenly lights. He received and drank in her
                     eloquent glances gladly, rejoicing; it was ambrosia; yet he remained
                     passive.
                  But if he was undemonstrative, she still perceived that she had understood him
                     correctly. As with hers, his emotional system was too near breaking into
                     visible, quivering ecstasies of delight for that delight to be entirely
                        repressed in face and eyes. Such
                     sensations will betray themselves. She perceived that she had
                     understood him correctly. He had spoken the truth of his heart and would be
                     true to his speech. The truth was divinely sweet to this sweet girl.
                  She rested her hands on his shoulders, inclined her person to him, and kissed
                     him warm on the mouth with her sweet lips.
                  You see, she wanted to give him an assurance that he need not doubt her; she
                     wanted to dispel from his mind every fear that it might harbor concerning
                     herself—concerning her desire and ability to be, or to make herself what he
                     might desire. She thought he would like it best so, and she wanted him to
                     understand that he had just surely betrothed himself to her—that she would
                     not—that she could not, fail him. She raised her bright brown head and said,
                     face and eyes shining:
                  "There is no danger for me if I have you to love. I shall not fail
                     to live as you desire. How can I," said she, wonderingly, "when you have saved my soul from ruin? I am yours entirely. Don't
                     fear for me. They shall never get me again. I will die first. But O! if we do
                     both live until the three years are expired, I will bless you better than
                        you have ever dreamed. You shall learn that the soul you have saved
                     can be worth something to you."
                  She spoke with intensity. Her closing thought—the thought of how hard she would
                     try, and how happy she might make the man she loved—multiplying itself
                     multifold and overflowing her soul with enthusiasm.
                  But, reader, will you believe it? Though aching to gather the trustful young
                     thing in his arms and surround her with his love, yet that stern-principled
                     young man controlled himself and did not respond to her caress,
                     then. He had given his decision, and both must abide by it. All he did was to
                     say:
                  "I will wait."
                  Still, she understood him. She saw and felt that he wanted to take her to his
                     heart; and that he suffered because he would not yet accept his happiness. It
                     made her pity him; and it also conquered her completely. Now more than ever she
                     wanted to show him that she understood him, that she felt for him, and that she
                     was most completely his own. And so, when she bent over and kissed him again it
                     was love pure and undefiled that she gave.
                  It was the sweetest and purest kiss that maiden ever gave to man, asked or
                     unasked; the sweeter and the purer inasmuch as her mind was now in that state
                     which is styled "silly" by some people. And it may have been silly in a certain
                     sense. It would have been the height of folly had she not been sure of the man;
                     for, so far as her own volition was concerned just then, she was standing just
                     on the verge of the awful precipice over which many, and many, and many a girl
                     has been lured to her ruin by the man she has loved. Her belief in his truth
                     had disarmed her of her will for the time. If Will had been a bad man she would
                     now most certainly have been giving herself to ruin. But being the high-souled
                     man he was, and capable to appreciate the divinity in her heart, she was safe,
                     and still the more highly prized in his estimation.
                  There was no danger for her when she took her lips from his the second time,
                     and said with sweet, serious earnestness and gravity:
                  "I trust you. I will be worthy of you. No one else shall ever have
                     me. I give myself to you unreservedly. Do with me as you will. I can be happy
                     either as the slave or as the equal of such a man as you, if you only love me,
                     because I know you will never abuse me."
                  Yet all Will did was to say:
                  "I think we shall be happy together, but I will wait."
                  Yet once more she stooped and gave her melting kiss. She meant it as the seal
                     to her everlasting resolve and her everlasting love.
                  She tempted—not as meaning to tempt—but she tempted him most sorely. He could
                     scarce keep his arms from about her; but still yet he did nothing. Were, or
                     were not, his principles making a wretch of him? Should he have given the
                     caress that she was famishing for, and that would have been worth so much to
                     her—just the one little kiss that would have made her so supremely happy? What
                     say you, little Miss Pert, of the world?
                  Well! Say what you please, and nevertheless there was a glad, glad little girl
                     went up to Chicago the next day.
                  The young couple now passed a brief space of time discussing and deciding on
                     the course of procedure that should
                     enable them to elude the vigilance of Lucy's old associates—a vigilance that
                     they knew would watch them tirelessly until they should be able to baffle
                     it.
                  Then Will left the hotel and went out into the city, where he made
                     arrangements, purchases, etc., necessary to the perfecting and carrying out of
                     his plans. He returned at a late hour, went to bed, and slept the sleep of the
                     tired traveler who lies down at night with his conscience at peace with God and
                     his fellow-men.
               
               
                  VI.
                  There was no lack of craft in Will's brain when he thought it necessary to
                     exercise that valuable quality of the mind in this sinful world of ours; and he
                     also had a pretty good opinion of his own abilities. He well knew that he and
                     Lucy would be followed and watched—that the robbers would endeavor to keep them
                     under strict espionage until they had effectually silenced her, and perhaps
                     also him; but he had not a fear but that he should outwit the most cunning and
                     active vigilance of those who would hereafter be her enemies as well as
                     his.
                  Lucy, he well knew would be their main object of pursuit, and hence he reasoned
                     that if he should separate from her, at the same time cheating them with regard
                     to her identity, he would thus distract their attention from her, and doubtless
                     also from himself, until he should have succeeded in baffling them completely.
                     He acted on that idea.
                  Therefore, on the morrow-morning when a saucily-dressed, bright-eyed, natty,
                     jaunty youth of about twelve or thirteen years, whose brows and hair wore an
                     entirely different color from their original hue, and whose cheeks wore the
                     rosy-red country bloom, stepped out from one entrance of the Michigan Exchange, while Will and a closely vailed young lady departed from
                     another door—when that youth stepped airily out and walked merrily down to the
                     station-house, gaily switching his newly purchased rattan, and eagerly and
                     familiarly chatting with anybody and everybody, naively telling them he was
                     just come from his father's great farm on the breezy champaign lands in the
                     vicinity of the city and was going to visit his uncle, the merchant in Chicago,
                     besides a deal more of important information, talking glibly and
                     unrestrainedly, just as the forward unsophisticated youngster will if you'll
                     only give him an ear—who could have divined it was the young Lucy V.C—s,
                     prospective wife of Wm. S. Dimond, Esq.?
                  Her own brother, though familiar with such tricks, did not suspect her at all
                     events. His keen eyes were fixed on two instead of one.
                  She saw him, and wanted to bid him good bye, O, so much! But she was a brave
                     little girl and with her brave will she held her throbbing heart close in its
                     confinement. She knew the value of the prize for which she was striving,
                     probably much better than some little girls who have always had it. She saw a
                     good character, a useful and happy life, and salvation ahead, and would not
                     throw away those blessings of the future by discovering herself to her
                     brother.
                  They got aboard the cars, and were soon flying along among the fruitful fields,
                     and halting now and then for a few minutes at the pleasant villages which are
                     so plentiful in Southern Michigan. Edward C—s, and the gang to which he
                     belonged, also had their agents on the train while Will and his veiled female
                     friend were crossing Michigan and Indiana. They were watchful of the young
                     couple, and toward the last, while crossing the wide solitary marshes at the
                     head of the lake, became very suspicious, but Will and the veiled female were
                     constantly on their guard, and succeeded in preventing their completely
                     fathoming the trick. Will was so successful in his strategy that he kept them
                     to their purpose of attending to the movements of the supposed sister of Edward
                     C—s until he had parted with her at the Tremont House in Chicago.
                  And afterwards, she was followed on her return to Detroit in the course of two
                     or three days, where the spies succeeded in ascertaining she was a smart,
                     graceful news-boy dressed in female apparel; but the boy knew no more
                     concerning Lucy V. C—s, with regard to his ability to identify her with the
                     farmer youth, or even with her own name, than he did of Queen Victoria's oldest
                     daughter, nor so much. He had probably seen Lucy more than a dozen times, but it had always been the
                     policy of the gang for purposes of their own, to allow, and to assist her to
                     keep her name from the public. The boy, too, had been well paid for his
                     services, and he had given them faithfully.
                  From Chicago the smart farmer boy went directly on to St. Charles on the
                     beautiful Fox river. Will stayed over a day in Chicago. Then he too went on to
                     St. Charles, to which place he also was dogged by two of the gang. There
                     however, leaving the railroad, and no one seeming to accompany him, he left
                     them behind him; they thinking he had parted with the young girl at the
                     Tremont, for the present, until about a week later when young C—s learned who
                     his companion really had been.
                  After that the hunters took up the trail again at St. Charles, but they could
                     never trace Will to any great distance from that place. He and Lucy, who had
                     joined him a few hours' journey from where they had left the railroad, were now
                     many, many long miles from there, and they had traveled by Will's own
                     conveyance purchased at St. Charles, too many hours by night, unobserved by any
                     one, traveling much out of their regular course, and making a five days journey
                     instead of two or three, to be successfully followed.
                  The young couple arrived at the aunt's in due time, and when Will had
                     introduced Lucy, related her history, and proclaimed her merits, the good woman
                     fell in love with her at once. The middle-aged woman and the young girl soon
                     became fast friends.
                  Will staid with his aunt a month, anticipating that they might be discovered,
                     but at the end of that time, not seeing nor hearing anything of the villains,
                     he announced his intention of departing for Iowa where he had decided to
                     go.
                  Although Will kept his reserve toward Lucy during the month and would not
                     fondle her, still he had inspired her heart with so perfect a faith in him and
                     she had learned so to worship him, that when he came to say good-bye she put
                     her arms about his neck and kissed him repeatedly.
                  And yet, if you will believe it, he gave her only words; but they were good
                     ones, for she smiled through her tears and was happy.
                  Lucy remained with the aunt and attended school at Will's desire for the three
                     years for which he had stipulated. She made good progress during the time,
                     though it was more with the assistance of the books with which her thoughtful
                     lover supplied her from time to time, than in consequence of the qualifications
                     of the teachers who were employed in that then wilderness region.
                  At the end of three years, Will, visiting the young Lucy, as he had also done
                     every year intervening, fondly acknowledged she had made all the improvement
                     during the time that he could desire.
                  So now, with his heart, his reason, and his will, all thoroughly enlisted, he
                     gladly made love to her in earnest. But what boots it, the maiden's heart had
                     been won three years previously and had never wavered in its allegiance, though
                     for all that she managed to keep him intensely interested and intensely
                     happy.
                  They were married, and Will says now, more than twenty years afterwards, that
                     the most noble and most lovely woman whom he idolizes, has fully redeemed the
                     unsought pledge she made to him in the parlor of the Michigan Exchange. Her
                     life is a constant and a supreme blessing to him; and their sons and daughters
                     are esteemed by their companions and friends as incomparable.
                  A word before closing, with reference to the fate of young Edward C—s, whom his
                     sister never saw after passing through Chicago.
                  Business calling a friend of mine to France during the late fearful struggle
                     there, he accidently learned of the death of the young villain. Under various
                     aliases he ran a long and successful career of crime—a career that embraced
                     within the scope of its operations the areas of two continents. Being in France
                     when war was declared against the Prussians, his love of adventure and the
                     desire to experience new and exciting sensations caused him to offer his
                     services to the French. He was accepted, immediately promoted to the command of
                     a company, and fell early in the contest while dauntlessly leading his column
                     on to death. He was a most able, brave man, and it is sad to think he could not
                     have put his talents to better uses.
                  One word more to him who may need it. If there be among my young agricultural
                     friends, any great-hearted, and large, but yet simple-minded young man like
                     Will, who reads my story, and it shall wake in his heart an admiration for Lucy V. C—s, now Lucy V. Dimond,
                     I shall not advise him to go and do as Will did; for, my young friend, the
                     society in which my heroine's girlhood was passed, is so constituted, that,
                     probably, it will not rear another such estimable character for many a long
                     year.
               
            
            
               DIAMOND LEAVES.
               IV.
               WHAT JULE AND I DID WITH THE WOLVES UP ON THE MAQUOKETA.
               
                  WM. S. DIMOND, Esq., and his sister, Miss Julia Dimond, are the hero and
                     heroine of the following interesting adventure. Their characters may be pretty
                     well apprehended from Mr. Dimond's language, which I have often, in the
                     progress of the story, transferred to paper almost literally as it was
                     addressed to me by him. Self-assertion is so strong a feature in his character
                     I have deemed it best to give him the benefit of the important personal "I"
                     throughout the narrative.
                  The incidents of the story—except that to avoid the possible charge of
                     "partiality" I have exercised a license of the story-teller and have purposely
                     disguised localities and events somewhat—are quite accurately rendered.
                  Understanding those facts, he who is in search of entertainment is bidden
                     welcome to read the records of an adventure whose details embrace some features
                     of as thrilling and absorbing interest as any that have ever been encountered
                     on the great and ever shifting Western frontier.
                  
                     AUTHOR.
                  
               
               
                  CIRCUMSTANCES PERTAINING TO THE ADVENTURE.
                  Just opposite where the boundary line between the two great states of 
                        Illinios
                        Illinois
                      and Wisconsin starts up out of its deep waters and shoots off east at
                     right angles with the course of the great Father of Rivers, picturesquely
                        perched on his bold and charming
                     bluffs, is the thriving mining and commercial town of Dubuque, named in honor
                     of Julien Dubuque, a gallant and persevering descendant from one of the
                     innumerable host of French pioneers who, a century ago, were among those who
                     crossed the Atlantic to colonize a New World and whose names are now
                     imperishably embalmed in history.
                  Forty miles exactly west from Dubuque, on as straight a course as the swan
                     flies twice yearly over the broad savannas of Iowa, you may cross that fair,
                     pure stream, the Maquoketa, on a substantial bridge spanning its musical flow
                     of waters in the midst of the city of Manchester.
                  There is scarce a fairer stream in all the world than the little Maquoketa.
                     About the size of the Juniata, its shallow current rippling swift and sweet
                     over beds of sand and rock, may rival the gurgling waters of that classic,
                     witching river as they come tumbling and rolling down to Harrisburg from the
                     higher Alleghany hills.
                  Unlike many of the rivers of the western prairies which are bedded sluggish,
                     slow, and malarious in broad areas of moist swale and dank fat intervale, the
                     Maquoketa gushing quick from limpid springs in the far uplands comprising the
                     great water-shed lying between the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the great
                     Northern Saskatchawan, comes bounding down in sweeping curves across wide
                     leagues of the rolling prairie hills of North Eastern Iowa, swift and free,
                     until it joins the swelling, absorbing flood of the great Mississippi.
                  In many respects it reminds one of the river system of New England. It has
                     scarce a margin of meadow lands, properly so called. Too shallow for purposes
                     of navigation and commerce, its clear current goes rollicking and laughing
                     along for many joyous miles, able to sustain the hum of a thousand factories,
                     and dispensing health, strength and pleasure in its course. These are blessings
                     and advantages not enjoyed in every locality.
                  But unlike the stony, sterile little farms of the Great American Hive, the
                     ample fields that are tributary to the little western river are generously
                     prolific. The soil, a clean but deep and strong sandy loam, repays well the
                     care of the husbandman.
                  The wheat he gets, is, according as he harvests it, either crystal amber, or it
                     is very white; the ears of corn with which he fattens his meat will shell a
                     pint apiece. The apple and all the small fruits flourish in vigorous
                     luxuriance.
                  The farm-houses of this charming region are fast taking superior rank to the
                     slate-covered dwellings—though no doubt happy homes—that are seen clustering so
                     numerously along the New England ridges. If you are much of a traveler you have
                     learned to correctly judge of the material prosperity of any particular
                     locality from the aspect and commodiousness of the farmers' homes.
                  Delightfully situated, right in the fairest, most healthful part of this
                     alluring domain, is the city of Manchester. Admirably seated on the clean,
                     sandy, easy swelling banks of the river, hugging it close, her children playing
                     in its renovating waters and breathing the invigorating atmosphere of the
                     region, she rules from her throne, a handsome, though I fear, an imperious and
                     a haughty little queen.
                  Her daughters are graceful, fair, and witty; her sons energetic and
                     enterprising—now and then one "level-headed," and quite a good many pretty near
                     to being so. She bids for railroads; she would like to dictate its political
                     policy and manufacture machinery for half a State. She aspires to rival her
                     grandmother who dwells but just a little way off down on the
                     river. And! well, yes, she'll do it—in time.
                  Such matters may not be of much consequence to you, who are engrossed with the
                     teeming fascinations ruling in the great city, or who have become peculiarly
                     attached to the Lares and Penates of your own venerable home; but for me and
                     for the appreciative reader they hold a peculiar and a powerful charm and
                     significance; and particularly did they hold this charm and significance for
                     myself, when, comparatively a poor man at the time, I apprehended twenty years
                     ago, before they were born into existence, their inevitable future advent.
                  Twenty-three years ago the country around the present flourishing town of
                     Manchester was a howling wilderness, almost strictly so. There was but now and
                     then a farm opened. The wild deer fattened almost unmolested on the lush, sweet
                     prairie grasses; the loping Indian, the prowling wolf, and the screeching lynx
                     ruled the night.
                  Twenty-three years ago I was a young man and was at one time exploring the
                     western wilds in search of a location where I might better my fortunes. While prosecuting my search my journeyings
                     brought me to the silvery, delightful Maquoketa at the present site of
                     Manchester. It is with strict truth, not metaphorcally, that I style the
                     Maquoketa a "silvery" stream. Its waters appear as pellucid and pure to the eye
                     as do the mountain rills of Vermont.
                  The beauty of the river and the attractions of the adjacent lands charmed me at
                     once, and doubtless I should have proceeded no further west, as I did, had I
                     not heard of the "Big Woods," the Indians' favorite haunt, out on the Cedar
                     some forty or fifty miles distant. Timber near his location is an important
                     desideratum with the settler in the West.
                  The reports concerning the "Cedar country" were too alluring to be withstood,
                     and so I journeyed along in the path of exploration. After leaving the
                     Maquoketa about three miles behind, the road trending west ran through a little
                     grove of about a thousand acres in extent. This grove, elliptical in form, I
                     discovered was well filled with some of the largest and best deciduous trees
                     that are indigenous to the prairie soil of the latitude; and skipping along
                     through its center, cutting it nearly in halves longitudinally, shining and
                     glancing along on its sinuous line of polished pebbles, was one of the
                     prettiest little rivulets imaginable.
                  Having beheld the beautiful grove and stream, and having surveyed the rolling
                     landscapes circumjacent, richly burdened with their heavy freight of wild
                     vegetable growth, I decided I could here requite my desires. Nevertheless,
                     resolved to be thorough, I proceeded to the "Cedar country," but speedily
                     returned to that gem of the prairies, the little grove near Manchester. That
                     section of country I could but perceive was surpassed by the advantages
                     pertaining to the lands bordering along the Maquoketa—surpassed by them, even
                     if there be a dearth of timber for so many broad, noble acres.
                  After returning to the Maquoketa I hastened immediately to the Land Office at
                     Dubuque and secured United States Government Patents for a tract of land
                     contiguous to the fine grove mentioned.
                  Having secured a title to the land I desired, and built a cabin on it, I
                     returned to New York, my native State, to escort to my new western home one of
                     my sisters who had promised to return with me and "keep house" for me if I
                     should please myself in the new country.
                  I had five sisters, any one of whom who was of proper age would gladly, for my
                     sake, have accompanied me into the wilderness. But there was but one among
                     their number whom I regarded as peculiarly fitted to fill the place; so,
                     passing the others all by, baby Maud, tender-hearted Lucy, magnificent, queenly
                        Belle,*
                      and white-skinned, blue-veined, yellow-haired lady Ida, I had selected
                      Jule.
                  
                     
                     *Belle was married previous to this time, and hence could not have
                        listened, but in mentioning her sisters the introduction of her name with
                        theirs has seemed unavoidable. Belle would have made as splendid a ruler
                        among her sex on the prairies as she did years ago in the woods.
                  
                  Like Ida, Jule also had a complexion white as milk, tawny yellow hair with
                     streaks in it that gleamed like gold in the sun or lamplight, and a superb form
                     that carried about with it the sweetest haughty grace of commanding ladyhood.
                     Her eyes held softened to a warm glow in their depths, the fires that have
                     burned brilliant in the eyes of the males of our race for many centuries. She
                     was tall and straight as the mountain spruce or as Juno, as agile and fleet as
                     the mountain antelope or chamois of Switzerland, and as lithe and strong as the
                     panther.
                  She was sure of eye, steady of nerve, and fleet of foot. She was warm-hearted,
                     faithful, and for a woman, singularly courageous and resolute. She was the
                     bravest person I have ever known, man or woman. No possible danger could ever
                     alarm her.
                  I could never account for it quite satisfactorily to myself, nor make it seem
                     right, but we five brothers and four sisters always addressed that regal
                     specimen of womanhood as Jule, instead of giving her, as her independent
                     character seemed to demand, her proper, sweet, strong name of Julia. I am
                     wondering to this day, how it is that, with all my instincts, sentiments, and
                     predilections earnestly protesting, I can outrage my sense of justice by
                     writing her name Jule. I suppose it must be and must have been because it grew
                     up with us as a habit; we brothers and sisters having thus learned to designate
                     the sweet, rosy-mouthed and rosy-cheeked child who was younger than many of us,
                     and whom we all dearly loved.
                  Well! well! dear sister Jule, your kind, generous disposition never rebelled.
                     Indeed! I doubt if you ever thought
                     that the name we gave you was susceptible of other interpretation than the most
                     perfect respect and love from us, but if you have, the noble man whose hearth
                     you daily brighten in the distant city daily offers you sweet guerdon of love
                     in recompense for past irritations as his full-toned, healthy, and kindly voice
                     habitually addresses you with the full, rich patronymic that our mother
                     bestowed upon you.
                  Jule accompanied me to the beckoning Maquoketa country. She brushed the dried
                     mortar drippings from the floor of the secluded cabin, and we entered with all
                     the zeal and zest dwelling in fresh young hearts, upon life in what was then
                     the vague, unexplored land beyond the Mississippi.
                  How different it all is to-day; countless herds ranging the beautiful sloping
                     pastures; innumerable fields of the cereal grains yellowing in their season in
                     the brilliant harvest sun; vast fields of corn, whose rows ranging across the
                     plain like columns of tall grenadiers; tower dark, green and stately into the
                     pure azure dome; the fair, pleasing landscape dotted with innumerable clumps of
                     thrifty, vigorous young trees, embosomed in whose shelter are thousands and
                     myriads of happy cottage homes whose hearth-fires are unceasingly sending their
                     incense heavenwards.
                  What enchanting—what happy scenes are yearly, and almost
                     spontaneously and magically springing into existence on the smiling western
                     prairies! O thou dear, generous, nourishing American Land, whom of thy children
                     can avoid loving thee? Ah! ye dear, beautiful landscapes that embellish so
                     charmingly the banks of the silver-shining, tinkling little western river, why
                     did I ever forsake ye?
                  Yes! to-day the teeming region along the Maquoketa shelters and nourishes many
                     a farmer and his loves and hopes in paradise and plenty—do they know what
                     charming and eloquent idyls they are living?—but twenty years ago the wild
                     Indian and the wilder wolf held almost undisputed sway.
                  When I came to the little grove mentioned there were scarce none to dispute
                     with the prowlers of the wilderness. One hard-headed old judge, together with
                     his amiable and competent wife, and their interesting family of one or two
                     enterprising sons and half a dozen very intelligent and pleasing marriageable
                     young daughters, besides three or four more settlers of less intellectual
                     consequence, comprised the vanguard of settlement and civilization for the
                     neighborhood; though before the adventure which I am about to relate had
                     transpired there were as many more people in as close proximity on the opposite
                     side of my place.
                  Jule and I soon settled quietly into our respective positions, and I diligently
                     commenced to pursue the hard routine life of the pioneer on the prairies; for
                     mind you, my reader, I was none of your soft-fingered moneyed loiterers who
                     could hire my labor done, while I sat or strolled around in listless ease. I
                     might, doubtless, have embraced a more intellectual occupation, but having, for
                     reasons satisfactory to myself, chosen to be a delver in the soil I did not
                     design to evade any of the responsibilities of the position.
                  And this reminds me to say to my young city reader that there are but few
                     pioneers in any wilderness country who do not devote a portion of time to
                     severe manual labor. The falsely educated Idler who is an integral part of the
                     false society of the great eastern cities will scarce believe such examples are
                     common, as they are, that I once caught a gentleman of means, who resides west
                     of the Mississippi, filling his wain, with his own strong arms, from the manure
                     pile in the heart of the city where he dwelt. He was a judge and a
                     land-surveyor and had brains and education ample to have pursued the calling of
                     first-class civil engineer. When both in their prime he could have beaten H. G.
                     at mathematics, at felling a tree, or, with a trusty rifle compelling the
                     scared, bounding deer to lower his "flag," any day.
                  In those early days of commencement on the Maquoketa there was seldom a
                     loiterer to be seen strolling at his leisure along its inviting, pleasant
                     banks. And to-day that class of people is not numerous west of the turbid flow
                     of the Mississippi.
                  Most of the time, for more than a year, I pursued my busy employment on my new
                     purchase, breaking the tough prairie sod, turning the rich mold up to the warm,
                     fructifying sun-light, and dropping the choice, curious seeds into the
                     generous, embracing bed, where they should be warmed into generation—into
                     active life—into up-springing, growing, fruitful beauty above the surface.
                  
                  During the winter I employed myself with cutting and hauling firewood, and with
                     getting out posts and rails from the grove with which to make a protecting
                     fence around my improvements.
                  Jule cooked my meals, kept the cabin tidy, and for amusement, when not visiting
                     the neighbors, walked, rifle in hand, many an hour by my side while I was
                     tracing furrows across the virgin meadows, every now and then knocking over a
                     gopher with a ball from her gun as she would catch sight of his funny little
                     form sitting erect on his haunches and peering curiously out at her from among
                     the spires of grass. I had early taught her how to use the rifle, and with her
                     keen, quick sight and steady nerve, she soon depopulated the immediate vicinity
                     of that pest to the grain fields of the western farmer, the gopher.
                  Also, having learned to use the gun with skill, she agreeably surprised me many
                     a day with a wild chicken for the pot or the gridiron, or with the brace of
                     wolf's ears that should claim their bounty from the government.
                  Wolves were, indeed, her specialty. How often, and often has she sought for
                     occasion and cut short the easy lope of the hungry marauder.
                  But though Jule and I destroyed many, and the neighbors occasionally caught
                     them napping, wolves were still too plentiful in numbers to be agreeable
                     companions; indeed! though the surrounding fruitful fields are all occupied,
                     though the country is thickly peopled, wolves are still, at the date of this
                     writing, 1871, occasionally seen to issue from one or two nearly impenetrable
                     thickets that are allowed to flourish in close proximity to Manchester. In
                     those old days they were a multitude, and in the fall and winter time often
                     made the night hideous with their hungry howlings.
                  They were so numerous and so much of an annoyance that, at last, after having
                     observed for some time and learned something of their habits, I arrived at the
                     conclusion that I could soon thin their numbers considerably, and at the same
                     time enjoy some fine sport.
                  One winter and two summers had, since our first arrival in the country, passed
                     agreeably away to us and been swallowed in the gulfs of the past. During the
                     time I had remarked that all the bones of animal and fowl that Jule had thrown
                     from our meals to a distance from the house had unaccountably disappeared soon
                     after being cast out.
                  I had reflected upon this circumstance for some time, finally deciding that the
                     bones were seized upon by the wolves and carried away by them during the night,
                     I having as yet been unable to procure a dog that might have taken them. I had
                     subsequently watched one night and satisfied myself that such was the case.
                     Hence my plans were based accordingly.
                  After having matured my plans I consulted with Jule, making her acquainted with
                     them. She readily concurred with my views and cordially agreed to give all the
                     assistance in her power.
                  Receiving my instructions, she commenced to retain in the house all the bones
                     from the meats that came under her culinary operations. Clinging to most of
                     them, to promote the object I had in view, was left a little of the flesh. With
                     the strips and shreds of raw flesh adhering to them, Jule stored the bones as
                     fast as they accumulated, in a small outhouse I had erected near by as a sort
                     of receptacle for general stores, where, during the winter they were
                     immediately frozen, and would remain until spring as fresh as when first placed
                     in store.
                  When March had arrived the bone pile was swelled to quite formidable
                     dimensions. It was composed chiefly of the bones of the deer, the rabbit, and
                     the prairie chicken, intermixed with which were some of the porcine and bovine
                     species of animals. Altogether there were more than three bushels of them. The
                     quantity of refuse matter that may be collected from the larder in the course
                     of three or four months, in that healthy climate, and still not all be saved,
                     is surprising.
               
               
                  THE ADVENTURE.
                  Choosing my time early in March, one evening when the moon was at the end of
                     the first quarter and it was pretty light, I scattered the bones outside the
                     cabin in a circuit of about a hundred and fifty feet diameter longitudinally,
                     and between the outhouse and the cabin. The earth was well frozen, not yet
                     having been penetrated by the spring warmth, and some few small patches of snow
                     and ice yet remained from the first
                     thaw of the season which had occurred about ten days previously.
                  Before scattering the bones, I had taken the precaution to thaw the frost from
                     them, and they were as sweet and would be as attractive to animal taste as if
                     they had been covered with warm quivering flesh but the day before.
                  Also at the time of distributing them I threw out among them several generous
                     slices of fresh raw venison, cut from various parts of a deer I had killed
                     during the day for the special purpose. The bones and the bloody, dripping meat
                     were distributed about seven o'clock in the evening; then Jule and I sat down
                     in the cabin, my two rifles loaded, ammunition convenient to hand, my axe
                     standing by the door, and every thing in order. Without lighting our
                     candle—deeming the moonlight sufficient for our purposes—we sat down and
                     waited, sanguine of results.
                  We had not long to wait. The wolf will scent the taint of fresh blood on the
                     air for a long distance, and he will hunt its trail much farther. He has been
                     known to follow the horse whose foot has been wounded, and from which has
                     issued an occasional drop of blood while he was pursuing his way over trackless
                     wastes of country, for many, many a long weary mile. He will track it,
                     persevering and patient of fatigue, till he is gaunt as famine, if only he may,
                     in the end, wet his crimson jaws with warm sweet blood. How he does love
                     it!
                  On this memorable evening Jule and I had sat but a little time, quiet and
                     attentive to outside noises, when we were rewarded by hearing the anticipated
                     whining, disagreeable, ugly howl, long drawn at intervals and prolonged on the
                     night air; not like the dog's though still there was a resemblance, but a howl
                     peculiar to the animal; something fearful and horrible to listen to; you'll
                     remember it if you ever hear it.
                  I have designated it as ugly and disagreeable, and I emphatically repeat that I
                     have never heard anything in nature so thoroughly fear-inspiring as the
                     horrible accord of sounds issuing in chorus from the hot throats of a hungry
                     pack of wolves—never anything so fear-inspiring unless it be the occasional
                     thunder storm that careers low over their favorite haunts.
                  I have listened to many threatening night noises on the prairie. The plaintive
                     wail of the catamount, unearthly in tone, inspires a mysterious dread; the
                     screech and the shriek of the fierce lynx are terribly alarming; but the voice
                     of that so-called, insignificant "varmint," the prairie wolf,
                     when he angrily salutes you in droves is sublimely appalling.
                  This evening when I first heard the marauder speak, I arose, anticipating what
                     was to ensue. I did not tremble nor shiver, but still when I thought how soon
                     the peaceful stillness of the beautiful evening, as it hovered calm, sweet, and
                     brooding, over the prairie outside, was to be violated by a fiercely
                     threatening concert of terrible howls, I will own that I felt a thrill of
                     horror creeping along my nerves: I knew so well of what they are capable when
                     many of them are collected together.
                  Jule also arose, and quietly stood regarding me, regal in her splendid beauty,
                     with a still smile wreathing her handsome and speaking face. She was perfectly
                     self-contained. I saw, that if need be she was ready to receive all the wolves
                     on the Maquoketa, and that too without desiring time to fortify her
                     courage.
                  Taking now my axe in my hand I opened the door of the cabin, stepped outside,
                     and crossed the intervening space of about seventy feet to the little out-house
                     standing beyond the bones. Arrived there, I swung the door on its hinges,
                     entered, and closed it behind me.
                  The rifles I had left with Jule. She, it had been agreed between us, should do
                     the slaying, and while I should secure the trophies of her skill by dragging
                     them into the outhouse where they would be safe from the fangs of their savage
                     brethren, was to reload the guns; my powder flask being topped with a thimble
                     of the proper size to contain a charge for either gun, the operation of
                     recharging could be readily performed in the dark.
                  The first warning cry heard by us while sitting in the cabin was very soon
                     answered by another, then another, and another, and yet many others. Their
                     hungry war notes were soon pealing all around us, filling the welkin with
                     harsh, angry music.
                  I cast a look from my one window of observation and at once the dusky, flitting
                     forms of the first two or three that rapidly approached, crossed my view. I
                     glanced across the frozen lawn to Jule. She was standing in easy attitude at the window of the cabin which
                     commanded the situation, with the muzzle of her rifle protruded from it where a
                     light of glass had been conveniently removed in answer to the demands of the
                     occasion.
                  Immediately, now, the first wolf came bounding into the arena that I had
                     established should be the place of conflict. He was agile, alert, and bold. The
                     wolf has been, and is, styled a skulking coward. When you see him bounding
                     lightly, easily, and gracefully across the prairie, every motion untrammeled
                     and free, or when you meet him face to face alone in the wilderness, and he
                     stands and returns your gaze with an eye as intent as your own, you will be
                     pretty sure to decide that he is, at least, not always such a contemptible
                     thing. I met one once when he was alone, and shot him square between the eyes
                     when they were gazing full and fearless into mine. He was serenely
                     contemplating me with his full front to me, his commanding attitude and proud
                     poise of head—his pose, as it seemed to me, bespeaking that he was
                     actuated by the purest of inherent royalty. I had much ado to pull the trigger
                     and destroy so much sovereignty.
                  So, on this evening, Jule experienced a species of the same sympathy with the
                     majestic, or the beautiful. It was more than a minute after the first wolf had
                     vaulted into her vision before her gun spoke in answer to his appearance.
                  She has since said to me that as he came careering in, she discovered in his
                     graceful and flexile movements so divine a beauty and perfection of natural and
                     easy motion that it infected her with a "spell" so powerful that
                     it was some time before she could resolve to take his life.
                  At last however, after more than a minute, the sharp crack of the rifle
                     reverberated against the fast accumulating howls, and the first that had made
                     his appearance in his careless, easy style, tumbled ingloriously to the earth.
                     I quickly grasped my axe, sprang out, seized our fallen foe by the back of the
                     neck and swiftly dragged him into the outhouse while he was yet struggling in
                     his death agonies, perceiving while I was accomplishing the feat that there
                     were half a dozen more within a hundred yards of me.
                  I had not closed the door before I heard the ringing report of the other rifle.
                     Without pausing to look, I swung around on one heel, and in a moment was again
                     outside; for I well knew that Jule never fired a gun in vain. Another wolf
                     down; and one, two, three, four, five—I took time to count them—yes, there were
                     ten more of the savage beasts skurrying around among the bones, snapping and
                     snarling; others in sight loping up, and yet others wildly howling as they
                     swiftly approached in the distance.
                  I soon had the second wolf in security, and then I paused to take breath. I had
                     worked with such celerity to get the two, that I was breathing quite fast and
                     hard. But I had barely recovered my equability of respiration when I saw the
                     blaze of the rifle, and another wolf fell. For the third time I sprang out
                     between the two buildings. Two or three of the boldest, not satisfied with the
                     bones, were prepared to dispute title with me for the quarry. They sprang in
                     and began fiercely to tear the dying animal. Quick as they, I rushed up to
                     defend and secure my half conquered rights. I raised my axe; it descended swift
                     as light, braining one of the aggressors. The others, intimidated for the
                     moment, retreated, and I proudly hauled two dead wolves after me as I gained my
                     place of retreat.
                  Having now a short respite I eagerly looked from my window. What a terror
                     inspiring scene to behold, and what a conjunction and combination of awful,
                     horrible noises accompanied and aided to explain the sight.
                  It was not a roar; not particularly loud, nor particularly deep; but an
                     incessant snapping, snarling, wrangling, rending pandemonium of confusion and
                     murderous contention. Imagine to yourself twenty wolves leaping and rushing
                     with crazy fury and with the rapidity of lightning, almost, back and forth
                     among one another, meeting, clashing, and rushing past at all conceivable
                     angles at all instants of time, incessantly snarling, snapping, and madly
                     fighting for the best bones—giving awful prominence and significance to their
                     passions by both voice and movement—together with the added terror of twenty
                     more approaching howls, soon to be mingled in dire strife with the first
                     twenty, and you may possibly get some conception of the dreadful scene I had
                     conjured up with the potent charms clinging to a few dead bones, and was now
                     witnessing with a fascinated and fearful interest, but still designed to
                     continue master of.
                  
                     It was pandemonium indeed. I think if you had been there you would
                     have pronounced it nearly as terrible a spectacle to look upon as Milton's Hell peopled
                     with all the demons and furies. Ugh! I shudder now when I recall to mind what a
                     wrathful congregation of red-mouthed fiends I lured together and afterward
                     miraculously escaped from on that evening.
                  Escaped from, because an unlooked for and great peril soon menaced me with its
                     imminent frowns. How truly has it been said that man proposes but God
                     disposes.
                  A longer interval of time than usual elapsed before I again heard the welcome
                     report of the rifle. Jule had delayed in order to charge both guns. But if the
                     time was longer, the lapse was still, really, of but brief duration, ere both
                     rifles were discharged almost simultaneously. Two wolves fell as if their legs
                     had been suddenly cut from under them; one at my door, the other within five
                     feet of the door of the cabin. The venturesome girl meant to have at least one
                     wolf in her stronghold. We both glided to our respective thresholds, stepped
                     over at the same instant and pulled in the trophies of the battle.
                  I had barely risen to an erect position and closed the door when my eyes as
                     usual sought the increasingly terrific and fascinating scene outside.
                  Horror of horrors! What was it that seemed to blast my sight so cruelly? What
                     was it that I saw that appalled my heart so fearfully? No! I could not be
                     mistaken. I saw all too plainly. Just bounding through the opposite window
                     where Jule was standing, was a dusky-grey, ponderous ball, instinct with
                     ferocious life, and I knew that others would soon follow unless prevented by
                     human agency. It had been so ordained in nature.
                  One huge old savage, more bold and daring than the rest, having seen Jule
                     outside, and having just spied her through the opening in the window after her
                     re-entrance into the house, was bent on blood for himself and revenge for his
                     kind. I saw the sash give way and the shivered glass glint and sparkle as it
                     fell to the ground through the crossing moonbeams between me and the cabin. I
                     remember so well; it seemed to me then as though light and hope for Jule were
                     falling down, down, with the broken glittering glass.
                  The savage beast was through the window and in the room with my sister, and
                     there had been no candle lighted during the evening whose cheerful flame might
                     intimidate to protect her from his rending fangs. Would he allow her time to
                     put up the barricade—a thick oaken plank that my team had hauled from Dubuque,
                     together with other necessaries, with much labor—before he attacked her? My
                     spirit, sore oppressed with mortal fear for her safety, groaned in agony, but I
                     hoped she would have time to act.
                  But while that thought was passing through my mind, I also thought that
                     whatever she might do I must base no hopes on a possible contingency. I myself
                     must be out and doing. It is only cowards, cripples, and imbeciles who stand
                     supine and inefficient when a life is at stake; unless there be others to bar
                     the way.
                  There was no time to lose. I opened my door, passed out, and closed it again in
                     an instant—mechanically, I think, or I should have left it swinging. I carried
                     my two double-barreled pistols in the belt I had put around my person for the
                     emergency. My axe I held in one hand.
                  As I stepped into the open air I drew forth one of my pistols from the belt, at
                     the same time casting a hurried glance across the lawn between the two little
                     buildings. It was alive with rushing, vicious, fierce brutes, whose burning
                     eyes glared flame, and whose hottest of tongues were eager to lap my blood into
                     their boiling throats.
                  Just then, as I was nerving myself for the rush, three more dusky shapes
                     vaulted up and seemed to soar, as if on wings, in at the demolished window. I
                     groaned aloud in despair:
                  "Holy God in Heaven! have you forsaken Jule?"
                  And yet, I did not despair, for, as another wolf was preparing to spring, I
                     raised my pistol, pressed the trigger, and the hammer fell.
                  P—ing! the ball sang as it went speeding on its errand of salvation. I
                     distinguished its whistle, clear and decisive, above the angry wolf-notes. It
                     made the sweetest music I have ever heard as it went singing so musically on
                     its mission. I believe that the new life with which the defective ball inspired
                     me while winging its way, singing, in search of the heart of the wolf at the
                     window, saved both mine and my sister's life that night. How often since have I
                     thanked God that there was a speck of dirt in the mold when it was cast.
                  My appearance among them, the sound of the pistol shot, and the fall of the
                     wolf at the window attracted the
                     attention of the entire band; some to the fallen wolf, but many more to myself;
                     but having now gained great heart I immediately made the rush for the opposite
                     door. Tearing across, three wolves with their glaring, lurid gaze fastened on
                     me, barred my immediate path, prepared to spring upon and tear me down. I
                     paused for three seconds at each, "sweetening" and softening the passions of
                     two with precious lead from my pistols, dashed my empty pistol rudely into the
                     face of the other between fires, and then bounded on over their writhing
                     bodies. Of the remainder, some fell immediately to devouring the three dead
                     brethren in their midst; numerous others closed in behind me sharp, snatching
                     great gores of cloth from my pants, and one or two nipping through, wickedly
                     and stingingly, into the quick flesh as I opened the door.
                  Reaching the door, I opened it with a jerk and sprang in, safe. I barred it in
                     an instant—lucky for me that Jule had not dropped the guarding cross bar—and
                     sprang to the window. Before I had reached it and could raise the plank to its
                     place, two more wolves dropped with a soft thud on the floor behind me. But I
                     did not mind them then; I swiftly raised the barricade and secured the window
                     against the entrance of more.
                  Then I looked anxiously about me—a blazing match had been touched to the wick
                     of the candle and it was now burning brightly, Jule might have retreated to her
                     bedroom—the one other room of the house that I had partitioned by itself with
                     plank rived with wedges from the bass wood, and having as yet only a curtain of
                     muslin to guard its doorway—Jule might have retreated to her bed-room as a
                     measurably safe place for a few minutes; but no, there the daring, fearless
                     creature stood, not in a corner—she was too sensible to trap herself in any
                     such manner—but advanced from one end of the room quite far enough so that she
                     had free, full swing for her clubbed rifle, and could strike surely and
                     effectively.
                  There she stood, laughing amusedly as she caught my eye, with her rifle poised
                     as a club, the first wolf that had entered kicking his last gasps at her feet,
                     and the others eyeing her stupidly, almost vacantly, not yet enough accustomed
                     to the light and to their new situation to venture an attack.
                  You may be sure I did not delay for them to declare war. The remaining ball in
                     my pistol humbled one of them instantly. Then throwing the weapon down and
                     seizing the other rifle which was standing convenient, I swung it very much as
                     an Irishman does his shillalah and soon broke the heads of two others.
                  Meantime Jule had belabored and despatched a fourth, and finding her rifle
                     rather cumbersome as a club, she had dropped it, had caught up a genuine
                     hickory about an inch and a quarter in diameter and some three feet long, which
                     we used to insert in a ring to raise the trap over my little "7 x 9" cellar,
                     and with it was pursuing and vigorously hitting the fifth, and now only
                     remaining live wolf in the room since my entrance.
                  Jule persistently chasing and raining heavy blows on the wolf with her hickory
                     club, and he fleeing as if pursued by an avenging fate, with his tail dropped
                     between his legs like a whipped cur, as no doubt he felt, struck me suddenly
                     and irresistibly as a scene so ludicrous that it caused an entire revulsion of
                     the emotions which had hitherto swayed me. I dropped into a chair, and despite
                     the intimidating ravings and howlings of the villains outside, I burst into a
                     violent paroxysm of laughter. I laughed deep and long. I laughed, and laughed,
                     and laughed, until I fear if they outside could have broken in upon us, they
                     might have found me so nearly exhausted that I must perforce have become their
                     easy prey.
                  "Lickety clip it!" "lickety clip it!" they raced around the room, the wolf's
                     feet falling thick and fast and with a soft, velvety pat, followed
                     remorselessly by Jule's heavier tread on the floor; she raining blows thick and
                     heavy, and I laughing. "Lickety clip it!" "lickety clip it!" and around they
                     ran, lively and fleet, savage celerity and youthful nimbleness, pursuer and
                     pursued, again and again, and again still repeated, many times.
                  Towards the last of the race the girl's luxuriant hair became loosened and
                     tumbled down, floating all about her bust and clear down to her hips in great
                     massy waves, a golden glory. It rolled around and into her face, interfering
                     with her vision quite perceptibly, but often as it came in front, back she
                     would perseveringly fling it with a quick toss of her head, and all the time
                     pursuing the poor wolf "lickety clip
                     it!" "lickety clip it!" and striking at every step. Her picturesque face
                     flushed a refined, delicate crimson; and her person undulating with suppleness
                     and strength as she ran, she appeared as an Amazonian Hebe might.
                  It was a superb picture. I shall never witness its like again.
                  Yet though the spectacle near the close challenged the most noble faculties of
                     the mind to admiration, I was still too much swayed by Momus or his twin
                     brother, to cease laughing. I laughed on and on, continuously, all the time the
                     race lasted.
                  But the principal personage in the striking and impressive scene did not heed
                     my laughter, other than it caused her speaking countenance to gather a little
                     more sternness than was natural to the circumstances, and impelled her to
                     strike a little more fiercely. And on she went. She still kept up the circuit
                     of the room and still kept striking. She was a girl who never gave in.
                  She pursued that last poor wolf with her light hickory club a good six minutes,
                     "lickety clip it!" always hitting his head, until she had broken his skull,
                     literally, into pieces like so much pounded clam-shells. His nose, mouth, eyes,
                     and entire face, were a mass of gore when he finally fell.
                  Having at last given him the finishing blow, she sat down in the middle of the
                     room to rest herself, queen of a singular scene.
                  The stove, standing near the middle of the room, had escaped any serious
                     damage; but the table was overturned and broken; two or three chairs broken;
                     crockery and Delft-ware, shivered from the shelves, was scattered about in
                     fragments, destroyed; a pail of water overturned, stood, whisked in and mixed
                     with blood, in sickening pools on the floor; and lying around promiscuously
                     among the debris, were the dead, bruised, and bloody carcasses of seven prairie
                     wolves of the largest size.
                  The burning candle, standing close beside me on the table, I had seized at the
                     commencement, and held convulsively griped in my hand during the entire chase,
                     so that we now had a good light by which to survey our surroundings.
                  Jule sat, wound up her splendid hair, surveyed the scene complacently, and
                     rested herself, while I reflected what should be done with the besiegers
                     outside. My thoughts, however, were soon called from the subject which
                     interested them.
                  Suddenly, before I had reached any conclusion, eight or ten shots fired in
                     quick succession and a cheery chorus of halloos attracted our attention to the
                     outside. I arose and went out.
                  The neighbors hearing the unusual disturbance around my "improvement" had come
                     to befriend us if we needed assistance. Their numbers—there were eight of them,
                     two being accompanied by their fearless young wives, besides two large and
                     powerful dogs—and their shots delivered so numerously had dispersed the
                     wolves.
                  After I had related the occurrences of the evening, the company, in compliment
                     of her conduct, unanimously presented Jule with the wolves they had slain after
                     coming to the rescue. There were eight of them, which together with seven in
                     the cabin and five in the little out-house made the complement twenty.
                  When I flayed the animals the next day I remarked that every one of them that
                     Jule had shot had had his head perforated by a ball on the same straight line
                     between the eyes; excepting two of the number which she had hit in the eye, one
                     in the right, the other in the left. She said that after she had commenced
                     shooting, their eyes seemed to burn and glare like two beacons purposely for
                     her to sight between.
                  With my neighbors came also a visitor—one of the soft-fingered, moneyed
                     do-nothings to whom I have alluded, but for a wonder, an anomaly in his class
                     and quite a sensible person, even in the sense that we farmers define the term,
                     sensible.
                  He was visiting the hard-headed old judge who was one of those who had preceded
                     me into the wilderness. Of course politeness required that he should be
                     introduced to Jule, and of course an introduction was given.
                  After that a mutual and attractive regard seemed to spring up between the two
                     at once and spontaneously—a regard that called them together often afterwards,
                     so that after a time they got to thinking they were congenially mated—and all
                     that.
                  And—O, dear! well, yes! I suppose I may as well acknowledge it; I lost my
                     housekeeper; though as to that
                     matter, even if she were the dearest and best of sisters, I yet had my
                     consolation. My own best Lucy was growing and patiently waiting for me down in
                     Illinois.
                  Yes, Jule married the judge's visitor. Her affection for me would have caused
                     her to deny her lover for a season, and remain in my cabin, but understanding
                     such a course would cause some grief I urged their immediate union. Jule
                     accordingly returned to the East almost immediately, and they were married
                     within six months from the time of the first meeting. And now, in these later
                     years, when Lucy and I visit them in their palatial city home, a tribe of
                     tow-headed urchins—they have fourteen children in all, great and small—yet they
                     are brave, bright lads, and bonnie, winsome lasses, call me uncle—'Bill. I suppose it is because my hands are hard, my face is brown, and I am a
                     countryman.
                  The bounties received for wolves' ears, amounting in all to just one hundred
                     dollars, bought Jule's wedding dress. She thought "that did pretty well for a
                     farmer's daughter."
                  The peltry not being very valuable at the time—in fact scarce salable at any
                     price—I retained for a few years. Eventually I sold the skins for a reasonable
                     sum to Mr. Geo. T—d, at present a member of the substantial mercantile firm of
                     B—d & T—d, Manchester, Iowa.

               V.
               EUREKA DARE.—A STORY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN.
               COMPRISED IN A QUINTUPLE SET OF CHAPTERS.
               
                  I.
                  
                     INITIAL.
                     AS rewriter or editor of the following story I deem it of importance to say
                        to the reader that Nelson Bascom, the hero, is a gentleman of leisure,
                        wealth, and culture, whom flattery, administered pretty freely by his elders
                        in his boyish days, and the command of unlimited means during his early
                        manhood has spoiled somewhat. Those influences carried along in his mind and
                        operating adversely as he grew into years and discovered the falsehoods, the
                        oppressions, and the injustices incessantly practiced under the fostering
                        and protecting care of society, tended to sour and harden in a measure, a
                        nature that was originally open, warm, and generous.
                     His temperament became, while he was still young in years, seriously
                        misanthropic; in fact, so much so, that he is now regarded by his friends as
                        cynical. And I may as well tell the reader, first as last, that, regarding
                        most fine people as inimical to virtue, his conduct toward them
                        is, at times, both uncouth and ugly; but to those whom he respects, and with
                        whom a permanent friendship is established, he is the most whole-souled and
                        generous fellow in existence. Another redeeming virtue of his is a perfect
                        and entire love for his wife.
                     His story, written by himself, and which, for sufficient reasons which will
                        appear in the narrative, he would not offer to the public through the medium of the
                        Press, I have prevailed with him to allow me to edit, thinking that the
                        peerless heroine may be set up, and that not inappropriately, as a model for
                        my fair young countrywomen, as, next to an honest man, a modest and virtuous
                        woman, which she is, is the most glorious thing in all the world.
                     But, in the connection and as explanatory, I would be understood as claiming
                        that the modesty and the virtue in woman which constitute the most glorious
                        thing must be to the world the manifest and comprehensible results achieved
                        by the active soul which knows no guile—which has never conceived sin to act
                        upon it.
                     Being acquainted with the heroine of Mr. Bascom's story I think my knowledge
                        of her character justifies me in saying that the lovelinesses of her mind
                        fill the description. She is as accomplished and pure-minded a lady as I
                        have ever met; and the circle of my acquaintance among the worthy is by no
                        means limited.
                     But of that the sensible reader may also judge for himself after reading the
                        little romance concerning her, which I give in very nearly the language used
                        in the hero's MS.
                     
                        N. S. R. B.
                     
                  
                  
                     MR. BASCOM'S PREFACE.
                     As the well-educated reader is aware, all stories are founded on fact. Even
                        those which are acknowledged by their authors as belonging in the realms of
                        fiction, have, interwoven in their web, matters of fact to which the
                        writers' brains are cognizant, even though they be unable to connect their
                        facts with any reminiscences of the past.
                     I do not say their hearts or their memories, but, their brains,
                        it being notorious that the loves of the heart may grow cold and die away,
                        and that many an individual can relate the particulars concerning some
                        circumstance or event that has transpired in the past, which others
                        recognize as his truth and which he once knew as such, but which neither his
                        cold heart nor his torpid mind now remembers as ever having been an
                        actuality in his personality.
                     The amount of knowledge floating around through the world that has lost its
                        paternity, or which its paternity has lost, is just incredible.
                     For instance: Say that twenty years ago Mrs. E. D. E. N. S. discovered and
                        promulgated the idea, or principle in psychology, based on reasonable
                        grounds, that every male mind from the time of Adam has had its twin,
                           or sister, among the gentler sex, with whom it should always correspond
                           in the closest, most loving communion to all eternity—that she
                        still remembers there is such a sweet truth for womankind to joy about,
                        existing in the fair domain presided over by the intellect and the
                        affections, but that she has actually forgotten that twenty years ago she
                        was the happy woman to first discover it:—imagine this I say of Mrs. E. D.
                        E. N. S. and I can truthfully assure you that it has its thousands and tens
                        of thousands of counterparts; whatever be the significance, whether of
                        greater or less consequence to the human race.
                     Also, there are many matters of truth related and passing current in the
                        world, with whose 
                           orgin
                           origin
                         the interested relator has never been acquainted.
                     The very nice distinction inculpated concerning memory and brains I leave
                        for the experienced metaphysician to explain and establish more completely
                        and satisfactorily than I care to do at present.
                     My story, then, the interested reader will understand, contains the
                        essential ingredient, truth; a story of truth, criticise as closely as he or
                        she may.
                     I do not aver, as the reader has understood, that, in its detail, it is
                        something which is incontrovertible—I do not aver this, because I have
                        endeavored to embellish with those rarer charms of the imagination which the
                        skillful author knows so well how to display; but its spirit I trust is
                        sufficiently true to the felicitous emotions experienced by two hearts of
                        purity and fire, to interest and charm the kindest, the truest, and the best
                        heart in existence; and to interest and charm without leading astray.
                     Further—my story has not, perhaps, a sufficiency of plot to thoroughly
                        beguile or fascinate the ardent lovers of mystery, but for that lack, if it
                        be a lack, I intend to some time make amends by writing a tale, the
                        wonderful performances and incomprehensible disappearances of whose
                        characters shall outvie in startling strangeness and all singularity the
                        astonishing feats of legerdemain said to be performed by Syrian, Chinese,
                        and East Indian jugglers. And in
                        the meantime, for lack of the most interesting plot in this, I offer a
                        narrative of weighty truth, embellished as I have already intimated, and to
                        culminate in the discovery of a very sweet, nearly perfect woman.
                     Ah! Dear Love! How heartily does my soul always pronounce your soul to be
                        one of the sweetest and loveliest of poems, incarnate!
                     I can say this of you so naturally, heartily, and thankfully, though to the
                        world my story is as yet simply but about a humble Pennsylvania girl who
                        grew into womanhood as many others may; whose heart, rich-freighted as it
                        may have been with ability to love, was yet only accidentally found by a man
                        while she was on the way, and who—the man—still retains that heart, and
                        together they are now passing through life as persons of their means and
                        mental calibre usually do.
                     So are we to the world—the cool, critical, cruel world which has not yet
                        surmised that there never has been, and probably never can be a mar to our
                        happiness which shall ever live within our own hearts; but of that, "more
                        anon," as is very suggestively said in the old plays.
                     The reader has, I suppose, remembered the title of my story. I hope so. It
                        is for his or her interest if he or she has; but if he or she has not, I now
                        advise him or her to glance at the two words of heading, there being
                        sometimes much in a name; but of that also, "more anon."
                  
               
               
                  II.
                  MR. BASCOM'S NARRATIVE.
                  SHE.
                  Every tale has its heroine. She is frequently kept so much in the background
                     that you would not suspect that charming inamorata of all masculine lovers
                     always has an existence. But this is nevertheless true, strictly, and always
                     true, as you can at any time demonstrate to your most perfect satisfaction by
                     thoroughly sifting the first or any subsequent tale you may hear. There is no
                     story, good or bad, in whose plot the woman is not involved.
                  However, my heroine, as you have already gathered from the language of the
                     first chapter, is a principal personage; so much of a principal personage that
                     you need not hunt through the mysteries of the tale in a baffling search,
                     trying to discover traces of her whereabouts. In fact, she is conspicuously
                     prominent, as virtues as eminent as hers always demand their possessor shall
                     be. The sterling qualities of such a woman always absorb to herself the merits
                     of any tale into which they may enter and 
                        constitue
                        constitute
                      a constituent part, and make her the chiefest personage.
                  Of this truth you shall soon be convinced—you shall soon learn that the woman
                     whose worth is so surely invested in my mind, wears, and rightfully wears the
                     right royal crown which may be rightfully awarded to right royal womanhood.
                  Be pleased to continue with me and you shall soon make her acquaintance as I
                     first knew her in her intelligent, spotless childhood, before she had entered
                     that hey-day of female life—her teens. O! those blissful years which created
                     for us an endless halcyon future! Can I ever bless them enough?
                  A trip, partly business and partly pleasure, took me in the summer of 184- into
                     the coal regions of Eastern Pennsylvania. John Dimond, now the Hon. John Dimond
                     of S—, a cousin and friend of mine, residing at the time in Buffalo, had had
                     considerable correspondence with the proprietors of the coal quarries or mines,
                     there, designing to introduce the coals to his advantage in the Buffalo
                        market.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *The great coal fields in the western part of the State were not then
                        discovered, and hence, of course, the tale cannot refer to them as being
                        also convenient to the Buffalo market at the time. N. S. R. B.
                  
                  The correspondence had proceeded so far that it 
                        necesitated
                        necessitated
                      his personal presence in Pennsylvania. Accordingly he had decided to
                     go there; but just at the time when he was busy making his preparations to
                     proceed on the journey, he was prostrated with a severe illness—an illness of
                     so alarming a character that it entirely incapacitated him for business
                     transactions for the time.
                  It being indispensable that some one should represent him with the Pennsylvania
                     men, he had not lain long on his sick bed before he began to cast about in his
                     mind in search of the proper person.
                     I being a valued friend, a man of leisure, and visiting him at the time, he
                     decided, for those and other influencing reasons, to employ me if I would
                     undertake the business. He requested me, therefore, to proceed to the coal
                     region in his place, and manage for him, if they should be manageable, the
                     important matters concerning the coals.
                  Having long desired to visit a State which I had learned abounded in some of
                     the most charming natural scenery, both grand and simple—landscape, rill,
                     river, and rugged mountain crag—and over which presided a people, warm-hearted,
                     loyal, engaging, and entertaining, I readily signified my willingness to comply
                     with his desire.
                  Hence, after receiving the necessary papers and instructions, I was, in a few
                     days, alternately rambling among the rough hills crowning pleasant verdurous
                     valleys and again boating on the beautiful rivers with some happy party of
                     pleasure seekers, to be succeeded by inspecting in turn that metallic carbon
                     which is now used by half the civilized world for fuel. How much more
                     inestimably valuable are the little black diamonds*
                        than are the lustrous gems of Asia and South America!
                  
                     
                     *Black Diamonds:—I find this term used as original in Mr. Bascom's MS.,
                        and at a time before it had become common. Is not this, as well as many
                        others similar, therein, original with him? There are several such unique
                        terms in his MS. that I do not remember to have ever seen in print until
                        since a date when I know his tale was completed. Has one of
                        those meanest of wretches, a literary pirate, been aboard of him? Or is
                        it only one of many similar literary coincidences, to be accounted for on
                        the principle that all human minds are always, at any particular time,
                        together exploring thought in the same grooves. N. S. R. B.
                  
                  Some people decry the notion of combining business with pleasure. Such people
                     argue: business first, pleasure afterward, or the world comes to ruin.
                  I do not desire to advocate anything which tends to sloth and effeminacy. I do
                     not ask any one to consider my acts as of sufficient value to be shrined in
                     their memories as examples for guidance in their own personal doings, or that
                     their efficacy for good ends has made me sufficiently illustrious to be
                     regarded and respected as a model; though I do claim to be of some importance
                     in the world. I only wish to say that while in Eastern Pennsylvania, when
                     combining business with pleasure, I had a fine time; thoroughly enjoyed myself;
                     experienced an exquisite enjoyment of nature, both human and of the parterres
                     of God's making, if a high wrought expression may be used.
                  I suspect from what I learned during my Pennsylvania trip and what I have
                     learned at other times, that, if people would but be original, there need be no
                     particular necessity, as regards the greater number, to hunt up and down
                     through time in search of an Exemplar. While on that trip I did as the good
                     spirit within me prompted, and as I felt. I was light-hearted and happy, and
                     acted it out; and believe I returned to my home in Western New York a better
                     man than I went away.
                  After attending to the business of my friend, which I found exceedingly
                     interesting to me, as well as promising a prospect of being quite profitable to
                     him, I turned my attention to the western portion of the State, having
                     originally conceived the design to make the acquaintence of that monster which
                     consumes so much coal—namely, Iron; and also those marvelous spurs of the
                     Alleghanies—marvelous because they are one of God's stupendous manifestations
                     of himself, and because there Iron has made his home and bed, and has there
                     slumbered, grim, ponderous, black, and terrible, for centuries; ready at all
                     times—always ready to be wrought for peace or war, for friend or for foe, for
                     life or death, hunger or satiety, for all the innumerable wants, passions,
                     pleasures, and vices of man. Who shall write the history of Iron and compress
                     that history into the size of a fifty-volumed Cyclopedia? In these years of
                     expansive thought a complete history of Iron would comprise a history of the
                     times.
                  I proceeded leisurely toward Western Pennsylvania, admiring on the way the
                     diversified scenery of the region; here, fair ranges of choice arable fields
                     fringed with their setting of evergreens; here again, vast groupings of immense
                     rocks, thrown lavishly and carelessly along on wide counties of billowy waste,
                     and embellished with the same ornamental scattering groups of dark, sentinel
                     trees; the whole unutterably, weirdly wild and solemn in its effect on the
                     receptive mind—the desolation and the solitude of the most ragged and rugged of
                     wildernesses—a rough, broken wilderness country of black rock and somber cedar
                     and pine.
                  There can be no scenery more recluse and wild, nor more sublimely gloomy and
                     awe-inspiring than are portions of the State of Pennsylvania—that Pennsylvania
                     that was, erewhile, and is, perhaps
                     yet, regarded as so smiling and fruitful by the followers of the whole-souled
                     Penn. The awful depths of the Yosemite*
                      —sheer precipices of a thousand feet—whose rent and scarred faces
                     assume a million different, wonderful, and terrible aspects, are not more
                     impressive—more calculated by the Divine Mind to inspire the soul with a fear
                     and worship of the mysterious in Nature—of the Omnipotent Power which such
                     manifestations indicate is held locked in her secret recesses—than is some of
                     the wild scenery within a hundred and fifty miles of Philadelphia.
                  
                     *The superior, more startling and impressive scenery of the upper
                        Yellowstone had not been explored when Mr. B. wrote his story, or perhaps
                        he might have referred to that for his comparison. N. S. R. B.
                  
                  And again, though the smiling, rippling Susquehanna, and the murmurous, rolling
                     Juniata are not bedded so deep among the bordering hills as may be the great
                     Columbia and the Colorado of the West, yet the bold bluff, the castellated crag
                     with its fantastic spur, its wondrous peristyle supporting pinnacle, tower, and
                     canopying dome, occurring constantly, cut into the upheaved, hard rock in
                     endless variety of form, and jutting into and overhanging their clear,
                     embracing waters, afford many a picture of beauty that is very alluring to the
                        lover of nature, and that is not often, in many respects,
                     excelled.
                  Half the great, proud State of Pennsylvania is one immense store-house for
                     Nature's marvels. Why does not some competent person write them up? Something
                     more, and higher, than the poem "Susquehanna," and that other
                     little gem "The Indian Girl," are needed.
                  I traveled down the fair, wide-spread Susquehanna to the latitude of
                     Philadelphia, and thence returned, diverging up the ragged gorge of the "blue
                     Juniata"—laughing Juniata, who, like a frolicsome girl, leaps and dances adown
                     the whole long length of her hard stone floor, until she shies out from among
                     the mountains into the open, smiling valleys, a liberated spirit of song and
                     gladness, where she composes herself to rest, reposes from her play, and dreams
                     away the accumulating summers. I diverged up the frolicsome Juniata, proceeding 
                        liesurely
                        leisurely
                      along among the hovering hills, admiring the multitude of beauties
                     and novelties which cluster along her narrow borders, until I had reached the
                     vicinity of a village that I will name S—. Here the superior natural
                     attractions of the panorama that might be advantageously viewed from the
                     surrounding summits crowning the long ridges of the mountain range, decided me
                     to tarry for a time.
                  In accordance with the decision, I sought and obtained lodgings at the village
                     inn, and commenced a series of explorations throughout the circumjacent
                     territory.
                  I pursued a prescribed course of search and adventure in the vicinity of S—,
                     for three or four days without meeting with anything more remarkable than the
                     discovery of some fine mountain scenery; and that was, in fact, the most I
                     cared about. At the end of that time—it was early one bright morning in the
                     latter part of July—I mounted my horse as usual and proceeded leisurely on an
                     excursion among the neighboring hills:—"prospecting," the villagers thought,
                     they having taken note of my propensity to ramble, and S— being in the vicinity
                     of the mining region—for learning and pleasure I said to myself, I was now
                     walking and anon galloping my horse among those rugged ridges, my mind greedy
                     to bear witness to the stupendous and the marvelous, and to the peace and
                     beauty reposing in slumbrous quiet in close proximity at their feet.
                  But the villagers were right as well as I; though not in the meaning they
                     meant. I was "prospecting," and though not for iron or coal, I found something
                     yet better than they, valuable as they are—I found the virgin gold, gold pure,
                     and unalloyed with baser metal; though the discovery was unpremeditated. I
                     found that gold which was an intelligent glad girl's impulsive fancy, ripened
                     in later years into a virtuous woman's love for man. Who shall count its worth?
                     Who can count its worth?
                  I think I never felt so brim full of life as I did on that July morning; never
                     enjoyed Nature with so keen a zest—never before, nor since, surveyed God in
                     Nature with such an ethereal clearness of perception in both the moral and
                     intellectual faculties as on that morning which was particularly wealthy in the
                     signs of God's love and power: the pure sky; the pure, sweet mountain breeze;
                     the sweet, luscious dew on plant and grass; the running brooklet; the rocks;
                     the trees; all the varied and inviting perspective of mountain and valley; all
                     the beauty and grandeur of scenery by which I was surrounded.
                  
                  I think I never enjoyed myself so well as on that morning, and yet I have
                     witnessed Nature where her manifestations are much more bold and striking—where
                     her grandeur is so profoundly impressive that one can almost discover the hand
                     of God as visible, palpably so, beyond anything which the mind can read in
                     ideas suggested by mere mountain, tree, river and rock, or any of them.
                  Though the hills were not of the loftiest, yet, on that morning I discovered in
                     their wavy proportions a massiveness which I think none beside but the Supreme
                     could have comprehended; a ruggedness which was awful; a combination of
                     groupings of the objects along their surfaces which was thoroughly imposing as
                     suggestive of illimitability in design. Masses of rock were disposed according
                     to the grandest of architectural designs; the trees scattered here and there
                     along the interspaces seemed to serve as embellishing shrubbery for the wide
                     surrounding slopes and lawns; immense cubes and other huge, irregular fragments
                     of stone were thrown along the acclivities in proximity to castellated
                     precipices in a manner that they might serve as stepping stones for giants or
                     archangels to their earthly palaces, and long rows of stately colonnade crowned
                     with their gorgeous capitals and interset with magnificent, stupendous buttress
                     and propylon, indicated that here might, indeed, be the abode of
                     immortality.
                  Though in July, the trees were clad in the brightest, most vivid green I have
                     ever beheld as drapery on trees. The frondage was as rich and perfect in bloom
                     and beauty as the fullest vernal season could have produced. The rivulet beside
                     which I had now halted my horse, rippled, tinkling, clinking, over its pebbled
                     bed, the clearest, dulcet, liquid music that water ever sang; and the water was
                     clear and pure as that famed Elixir, a draught of which bequeaths an eternity
                     of mortal life.
                  Animate nature was in harmony with inanimate. Birds sang sweetly in unison with
                     the water, and the zephyrs playing in accord among the harp-strung foliage of
                     the occasional pine, produced a symphony unrivaled even by the human voice and
                     all the accompaniments of art. The squirrel's flexile motion was vast in its
                     suppleness, while his fresh morning coat toned well in the grand accord of
                     agreeable sights and sounds, rivaling the plumage of the bird, which shone with
                     a luster outvieing that with which the silver dew polished shrub, and plant,
                     and grass. And the dun deer bounded his sinuous course in a light and mazy
                     dance for the entertainment of the immortal inhabitants of the lofty,
                     rock-ribbed castles of the hills.
                  Raising my eyes from the view of these manifold—the sweet, the grand, and the
                     entrancing objects of contemplation, into the purer and grander empyrean, a
                     feeling of such ethereal delight filled my system from the citadels of life,
                     and gradually and surely enveloped my interior soul as would be utterly
                     impossible to describe. My soul appeared to feel exalted above sense—even above
                     all mere human reason—above the frailties and failings of earth, and eminently
                     able to carry itself and its enshrining casket, the body, whithersoever it
                     would. It seemed to me to have escaped from all the grossnesses and mazes of
                     the flesh, and to stand proud and free, of its own will and right, the master
                     of its mortality.
                  As something also approaching to an expression of the sensations I experienced,
                     I will transcribe from the letter of a valued friend, language of his relative
                     to his emotions while living through a half hour of joy in a situation somewhat
                     similar. The friend intimated is a young gentleman*
                      of culture and considerable intelligence, and one whose opinion I value
                     highly in regard to most questions of a metaphysical character. Whatever he has
                     written thus far in life I regard as truth. He says:—
                  "This scene, so many times witnessed, on its contemplation yesterday morning so
                     filled me with the essential ethers of delight that I actually realized in
                     thought, then and there, as I have frequently heretofore experienced in dreams,
                     that I could mightily and lightly bound, with great easy leaps, and sustain
                     myself in mid air with slight effort of volition while passing from one to
                     another of the highest of the D— hills, shouting exultingly as my person
                     described the apex of the arch in each soaring vault—Life! life! sweet life!
                     brim-full, soaring, most exalted, exulting life! Eureka! Eureka!!"
                  
                     
                     *Boyd Dimond; brother second younger than Hon. John Dimond. He was very
                        young indeed at this time. He died but a few years later. N. S. R. B.
                  
                  Very like were my sensations and emotions that July morning as I viewed the
                     pine-robed Pennsylvania Alleghanies under the pure Pennsylvania sky.
                  
                  Had I, like De Quincey, ever addicted myself to the use of opium or any other
                     strong drug or narcotic I might have attributed my gorgeous and sublimed
                     fancies to the weird spell which the habitual "pill," as repeatedly as taken,
                     weaves around, and with which it envelopes the brain of the indulger; or to
                     some fascinating influence over the mind lurking latent in the drugs of some
                     former indulgence which remained in the system to be called into action and
                     exercise power during some subsequent occasion of excitement.
                  But as I was hale and sound and had not tasted opium nor anything of the kind
                     for many months, and never only as incidental to experiment, I think I may,
                     without any irreverence to the venerable prophets, ascribe my—what the tame
                     will call, hallucination—but in reality, my teeming and exalted thoughts to a
                     direct and very natural inspiration.
                  Sitting there on my horse by the clear running water, in that solitude so
                     expressive and influencing, completely enwrapped and absorbed in the holy
                     influences emanating from the beauties and sublimities in which I was
                     environed—sitting there; as if in answer, and as if spoken by some Omnipotent
                     filling that solitude where I had imagined no existence as high as, or equal
                     with myself—as if in answer to my unreadable and most secret thoughts, I heard
                     what was seemingly some angel, or demigod, with a man's voice strong, clear,
                     musical, and bass, call:—
                  "Eureka!"
                  So perfectly and entirely was I under the spell of the enchantment, that, for a
                     few moments after—my mind recurring with a flash of thought to Milton's Angel
                     who visits and counsels Adam—I acknowledged the presence of the supernatural
                     and was about answering:—
                  "Glory! It is true!"
                  When, lo! a vision: Not like him who appeared in serene, severe, but gracious
                     and pitying superiority, to reveal to the first Father the future woe and
                     subsequent redemption of a fallen world; but still, something as pure, as
                     sweet, and as holy, if not invested with really angelic benignity and
                     truth.
                  The vision was a beautiful and pure young creature of human flesh and
                     blood.
                  Limned by the young and sweet morning light against the dark, rich, green
                     trees; the dew glittering in jewels around her as she brushed and scattered the
                     bright drops in passing; her young, classic head wreathed with a coronal of
                     wild mountain blooms; her arms and bust decked and zoned with circlets and
                     festoons of evergreen creepers interspersed with bright red berries and
                     woodland flowers; every motion lithe and flexile; her brow clear, strong, and
                     decided, with lower face and mouth to match; a countenance sweet as we imagine
                     Eve's; the glad light of young life, of innocence, and of intellect, all
                     shining harmoniously in her eloquent eyes and face; that vision!—there it was!
                     with her full front turned to me just at the instant of discovery—just on the
                     last advancing step, poised in an attitude of indescribable grace and beauty;
                     pure, proud, free, and unrestrained, she stood, a girl of ten—the most
                     beautiful picture to be seen in all the Universe.
                  Just as our eyes met, her lips were parting, and instead of my responding to
                     the angel, she answered:—
                  "Father!"
                  Again came the clear, musical bass voice:
                  "Before you return from school go to Old Jube's and get the bottle."
                  With her eyes still in mine, in which they seemed to me to be lost, as if mine
                     had the power of sudden fascination, for hers had not turned, raised or fallen,
                     nor blenched for a single instant, though her will still obeyed an older and
                     nearer power, the young girl replied:
                  "Yes, father!"
                  And then, immediately, pained by some hard, secret thought, the heaven I had so
                     briefly seen in those fine eyes began to wane; but the innocence was still
                     there. Her brow lost none of its integrity, though her sweet mouth gathered a
                     slight spasm of rigidity.
                  She kept all her grace and pride of bearing—manifestations of youth, innocence,
                     and incorruptibility, but I saw and knew in a moment that her soul was crying
                     bitterly, though the visible outward manifestation was so nearly
                     imperceptible.
                  I saw too that thus early in life she had passed the age, of whom there are few
                     that do, when women never weep; but her soul was crying bitterly.
                     Why?—and she so young and diffusing such an air of regal innocence about
                     her?
                  
                  I was now thoroughly awakened from my heaven-born inspirations as they had been
                     immediately before I saw this beautiful being; and she, before I had spoken,
                     recovering and banishing with a sudden and strong effort of her young will of
                     steel the hard pain which had assailed her, recollected her native, inborn
                     modesty, and gathering her looks to herself dropped a pretty courtesy and said,
                     while just the slightest tint of the rosy blush suffused her fair, pure
                     countenance:—
                  "A happy morning to you sir. We never had a visitor on our part of the mountain
                     before, and it has surprised me a little to see you."
                  What did this mean?—this young creature of the wilderness—this young cottage
                     girl of only ten summers—this wild mountain flower, addressing me with a grace
                     and propriety of speech, and an accent unrivaled by that of a Boston lady? Was
                     she a rara avis? More perfect than a Hebe in
                     her physical contour, because molded from a model of a loftier order; too young
                     and too profoundly beautiful to be styled bewitching; having mental
                     accomplishments which, though she had spoken to me but once, I had already
                     discovered were rare in one of her age, had she also and really, as her
                     countenance and speech seemed to indicate, a heart to match?—a heart that was
                     warm, and sweet, and pure, and just, entirely?—a heart that would scorn
                     deceit—hate it as God hates sin?
                  I thought and believed she had. I believed more. Intuitively, I believed that I
                     should learn decisively.
                  While she was uttering the closing words of her address, as if liking my
                     presence and eager to make me welcome to her domain, redundancy of life
                     seconding the wish, she impulsively resumed and continued the course towards me
                     in which she had paused while addressing her father.
                  She was advancing in obedience to the desire named, and involuntarily as it
                     seemed, and had taken some two or three steps in my direction, when!—down came
                     the small, bare, shapely white foot on an enormous snake which had emerged from
                     the tall grass close by her side and was gliding noiseless and noisome across
                     her path:—enormous I say, because for one of the venomless, and so considered
                     harmless kinds of reptiles it was a mottled black and white skinned monster of
                     more than four feet in length.
                  I regarded the incident as singular at the time, never before in all my
                     experience having known a snake to approach a person who had been stationary
                     for a few moments and talking during the interim; though whether the ordinary
                     tone of the human voice affects the reptile kingdom as does music I am not
                     prepared to say.
                  I saw the ugly thing before the lovely foot descended, and had raised my hand
                     and was just about to utter an audible warning, when I saw it was too late and
                     refrained. The fair, graceful child recognized the motion of my hand and the
                     warning in my eye, and would have obeyed their suggestions, but on the instant,
                     the little delicate foot of alabaster polish was on the monster. In less than
                     three seconds of time both ankles were in its horrible and tightening coils,
                     drawn together quick, sure and deadly.
                  It was flattering to me certainly, however dangerous to her, that the influence
                     of my presence had so completely distracted the attention of so bright and
                     keen-sighted a girl from her other surroundings, but of that I could take no
                     cognizance at the time, of course. Her precious life was in too imminent peril.
                     My sympathies were instantly enlisted for her rescue.
                  But, meantime, did she shriek or faint? O, no! She had barely felt the sure and
                     awful constriction around those trim ankles before both hands had sought and
                     grasped the triple coils and were diligently striving to free them from the
                     hideous and hateful embrace. But those binding, crushing coils were relentless
                     to her. Her little strength could not suffice. Had not a man's energies been
                     speedily forthcoming, the sinless soul of another child—of another of earth's
                     choicest and best, had now been rejoicing in heaven.
                  I was not idle, either in thought or movement, but acting before my raised hand
                     had fallen. It required but a moment for me to fling myself from the saddle and
                     pass the short intervening distance of slight ascent between us, when I was
                     close before the brave girl, ready for action as quick and sure as the
                     serpent's.
                  As I hastened toward her my voice vibrated sharp on the solitude:—
                  "Stand erect, quick!"
                  Instantly the slight, bent form rose upright and stood, statuesque; the face
                     white as pure lily petals floating
                     on the water, but no quiver of nerve nor blench of the eye.
                  Stooping before the little princess, with my right hand I grasped the snake
                     firmly around the neck, wrenching asunder the compressing folds of his fast
                     increasing length with the other. Then I jerked the ugly, defiling thing from
                     her person, and raising it aloft at once, hurled it with all my might against a
                     neighboring, jagged rock. For a moment or two I sternly regarded its writhing,
                     dying convulsions, and then turning to the interesting little maiden, who was
                     regarding me, not the snake, very intently, I said:—
                  "We must go to the water and cleanse ourselves of the slime."
                  We stepped together to the convenient rivulet and in its clear waters soon
                     removed from our persons all disgusting stains and sensations.
                  After washing my hands I had seated myself on a large piece of rock near by and
                     was drying them with my handkerchief and quietly observing the movements of my
                     interesting young companion, when she stepped out from the shallow running
                     water in which she was wading, and, approaching where I sat, placed her hand
                     under mine, raised it to her lips very tenderly, saying simply, but with an air
                     and tone of the most intense conviction as she performed the action, while
                     there was a soft, deep light, and the dawn of a summer morning in her
                     eyes:—
                  "I know you are good."
                  The appeal was irresistible. I drew the slight form of the child into my lap,
                     put my arm about her, and gave her a caress with a simpler and sincerer delight
                     than I had ever in boyish days taken forfeited kisses from laughing, resisting
                     maidens who, with wide awake boys played wild and exciting games in farmers'
                     kitchens.
                  And, considering that she was a girl whose every nerve quivered, and whose blue
                     blood tingled with the desire for motion, she sat very quietly and contentedly
                     in my embrace. With a child's intuitions she had already read my heart to her
                     satisfaction, pronounced it good, and given me her entire confidence.
                  After I had responded to her childish and natural, though unpremeditated call
                     for love, I said:—
                  "And your name is Eureka is it my little dear?"
                  "Yes, sir!"
                  "And is that all?"
                  "Eureka Dare, sir."
                  My next question, prompted by the clean and dry state of the vines and summer
                     flowers with which she had tastefully decked herself, was:—
                  "How is it that your garlands are so nice and dry? Did not you make them this
                     morning?"
                  "O no sir! I gather the vines, the berries and the flowers almost every
                     afternoon when I return home from school; and father and I twist and weave them
                     together in the evening. Two or three other girls who attend the school do the
                     same. We think they are very pretty and nice."
                  "And I, too," I said.
                  And before I had propounded my next question, which I designed should be of
                     considerable weight and importance, curiosity and a fast growing interest that
                     I had remarked in her manner during the last two or three responses, prompting
                     her, very urgently, to become the querist in turn, the maiden immediately
                     asked:—
                  "May I ask your name, sir?"
                  I gently took the child in my arms and placing her on her feet, stepped from
                     her a few paces, when, inclining my head with as courtly an air and modulating
                     my voice to as suave and agreeable a tone as any with which I had ever saluted
                     the mistresses of luxurious parlors behind the handsome, artistically wrought
                     fronts of Madison Square and the Avenues, I responded:—
                  "Certainly you may. My name is Bascom. Nelson Bascom, at your service, Miss
                     Dare."
                  It was worth more than all the wealth of Peru in the old days to behold the
                     dignity, the grace, and the courtly tenderness manifested in her bearing as she
                     caught the very finest spirit of my manner, and imparted it again in her reply
                     when she said:—
                  "I am happier in making the acquaintance of Mr. Bascom than I can express. Mr.
                     Bascom knows that it is probable that he has just won my life, and is entitled
                     to the gratitude—the deepest gratitude of my heart. That gratitude is flowing
                     to him in full measure."
                  I never was so completely surprised in my life, as then. A "grizzly" suddenly
                     springing upon me and my party once,
                     in one of the many canons among the Sierras of California, did not take me more
                     aback than did this language and these sentiments of the young Eureka.
                  This finished, sincere, and delicate speech, worthy to have issued from the
                     lips of one of the best of women of thrice her years, emanating as it did from
                     the heart of a rustic child, certainly astonished as much as it gratified me.
                     Where and how could she have learned so much, so finely, and so well? This was
                     indeed four-fold what her first correct, graceful address had prepared me to
                     anticipate.
                  But recovering myself before my astonishment had become remarkably manifest, I
                     assured the charming girl that the pleasure of acquaintance was mutual;
                     complimented her on her bravery about the snake, which brought the deep, warm
                     light again into her eyes, it intensifying as I informed her it was more
                     pleasurable to me to 
                        recieve
                        receive
                      gratitude than gold, and concluded with inviting her to a seat with
                     me on my horse, as I doubted not she was proceeding to the little school-house
                     which I had observed a day or two previously, situated some two or three miles
                     away, down in the valley.
                  "O yes!" she chimed, "I have been wishing it so much."
                  Naively spoken now, artless and simple, like any other girl of ten.
                  I instantly comprehended that the enthusiastic freshness belonging to, and worn
                     so gracefully by those who are young in years, had not been driven out from her
                     nature by any premature development of intellect; and that whatever Iron of
                     sorrow might have entered her soul, she had a will, or a mind, as you will,
                     that could, and would, and did, compass that sorrow and hold it in
                     subjection.
                  My horse having been thoroughly trained was quietly standing in the pathway
                     where I had dismounted, awaiting my approach. I went up to him and mounted,
                     placing the little Eureka before me; then, putting him into an exhilerating
                     gallop, continued a snatching conversation with her as he sped along.
                  I soon learned how far she had progressed in grammar, arithmetic, geography,
                     etc., etc. With the system of short questions I introduced, I pretty soon and
                     surely suspected that she was more competent than her teacher, and might have
                     spared her the pain of the concluding, elucidating query, but I was desirous of
                     noting its effect—more so I now apprehend than I would at the time have
                     acknowledged—therefore, I introduced finally, and as the key to unlock the
                     whole:
                  "And can Miss H—," she had given me her teacher's name, "instruct you in all
                     these things?"
                  Instantly turning her sweet countenance up to mine, in which I now saw grief
                     dimming the happy light, she appealed:
                  "Mr. Bascom please don't urge me to answer that: for if you do, I must answer,
                     because I think—I believe—I feel, that—that I must reply when you ask; but
                     please don't ask that. I do believe you are good. And, please, mayn't I like
                     you, and won't you like me if I don't tell you?"
                  I was answered. My only reply was to give the precious child a kiss.
                  And then, after two or three seconds of expressive silence, during which I
                     lashed myself severely for inflicting the cruelty that had elicited so pathetic
                     an entreaty from such innocent lips, she added:
                  "Miss H— is very good and a great deal older than I."
                  Again I caressed the dear, dear girl, restoring her confidence in
                     herself and me by saying that nothing had as yet arisen, and I hoped nothing
                     ever would occur to destroy the mutual liking that was growing so happily
                     between us—that I was quite desirous to treasure all the good-will she was
                     cherishing for me, and that it would be one of the greatest of pleasures to me
                     if she would always remain my friend.
                  With her countenance glowing with happiness she appropriated my sentiment at
                     once, saying eagerly:
                  "I like you, and I shall always be your friend," while with myself I
                     soliloquized:
                  "What a noble heart! And I, numbered among the very few who are thus blessed,
                     have found this pearl—a rare and costly gem. Will I keep it?"
                  And man of the world that I was, having partaken of joys with the light, and
                     vain, and frivolous, and all without compunction, and with a heart indurated
                     with the mechanical, cold forms and ceremonies of society, as some might deem,
                     yet, there on horseback in the Pennsylvania wild, there was a subtle, elevating
                     influence flowing, as it seemed, from the air and spirit of that pure young
                     thing whom I held in my shelter,
                     that imperatively bade me look within and search my conscience for proof that
                     should justify me in my own eyes as being worthy to rank myself her equal. The
                     quest, though occupying but a few minutes, was yet long and laborious, and my
                     soul began to feel weary as I began to fear it would prove fruitless. But at
                     last, after having gathered in all the old threads and ends of memory that had
                     been dropped all along by the wayside while I was climbing to my altitude of
                     twenty-six years, the desired light, consolation, and assistance came. At last
                     I reflected exultingly, that though I had tasted of a multitude of follies,
                     yet, among them all I had never offered an intentional wrong to one of my
                     kind.
                  It was a happy self-catechism for me; for, unconsciously to myself, that
                     searching of the soul was to prepare and fit it for the action that I assumed
                     six years afterwards—action that was fraught with an eternity of happiness to
                     two young souls.
                  One other little incident transpired during that ride which confirmed my belief
                     in the entire excellence of my little friend, if confirmation could be of that
                     of which I was already confident.
                  We had proceeded about half the distance to the school-house, when, in passing
                     a tangle of briars that was crowned with some half dozen handfuls of large
                     jet-black berries, the little girl impulsively and eagerly raised herself
                     against my arm, exclaiming with the impulse of the movement:—
                  "O, Mr. Bascom! if you please, won't you ride alongside of those bushes and
                     allow me to gather some of the berries. I have been waiting a long time for
                     them and now they are just right."
                  Perceiving there was some more than ordinary influence—a powerful influence at
                     work within her mind, and desirous to possess myself of the source of her
                     eagerness, I queried:—
                  "Why does my little friend desire the berries so much?"
                  The tenderness of feeling cherished for a remembered object of her care
                     expressed in her tone and manner, was very charming and very lovely, as she
                     softly and sweetly replied:—
                  "Old Aunt Patsy, who lives down in the valley by the school-house is sick and
                     unable to get such things for herself, and I think they may do her good."
                  "Does Aunt Patsy know you are to gather and bring them to her?"
                  "No, sir! but I thought if I gathered and carried them before I informed her,
                     the pleasure of the surprise might benefit her as much as the berries
                     would."
                  How thoughtful! How reflective, even! How tender and how kind! And as I parted
                     with the most lovely little girl of ten as she was carrying the berries into
                     the sick old woman's hut, I swiftly reviewed my brief acquaintance with her,
                     and as I arrived at the conclusion mentally ejaculated:—
                  "Eureka! Purity! Truth! It is true. She, fair, and sweet, and pure entirely—a
                     jewel of priceless value; and I, though before my prime, what am I?—a worn
                     veteran in and of the world."
                  I asked and answered the question thus; but does the reader imagine from this
                     and from what has preceded that I was in love with the child? Then, I say:—
                  "No!"
                  But I am willing to acknowledge that I was so deeply impressed with her
                     engaging ways, her innocence, her perfections, that, had I found her a
                     houseless and homeless wanderer, I would have made myself her lover, young as
                     she was; would have cherished her to development and thereafter forever.
                  It is not every day in the year that a man can pick up a waif from the wayside
                     whose worth is beyond all computation.
                  And though I did not know it at the time I am now willing to
                     acknowledge that I was on the road to love; in corroboration of
                     which admission I am also willing to acknowledge that before we parted at the
                     old woman's hut, I had said to the engaging, lovely child:—
                  "Shall I come and make you a visit at your father's house?"
                  To which she responded with all the warmth of her warm heart:—
                  "It will make me very happy, indeed, if you will."
                  And thus endeth the chapter about SHE.
               
               
                  
                  III.
                  MESNE.
                  "Philosophy teaches that that to which can be applied the
                     principle—extension—must have a middle."
                  Such was my reply to the Cynic to whom I had communicated my title word for the
                     third chapter in Mr. Bascom's story, and who had remarked thereupon concerning
                     its extreme oddity.
                  He now responded:—
                  "Certainly, the title is not altogether inappropriate as regards the position of the chapter; but why not retain FATHER, the title word
                     in the original MS.?"
                  
                     Writer:—"Considering the character of the personage most talked
                     about in this chapter, I cannot satisfy myself but that the word Mesne is the most appropriate word to use. You know that the disgraceful
                     fate, brought on by his own folly, of the personage in question, places him
                     beyond the pale of respect. And if we commence to show respect to those, or to
                     the memory of those who wilfully and wickedly throw away their lives, how long
                     will good opinion be of value to respectable people?"
                  
                     Cynic:—"Well! well! I suppose you are right. Have it your own
                     way, at all events; still, my father-in-law was a much abused man."
                  Then, desirous I suppose of being disputatious, and perhaps therefore not
                     apprehending the levity of the question, he reverts to my axiom of
                     introduction, with:—
                  "But where is the middle chapter of the story which has an even number of
                     chapters?"
                  
                     Writer:—Elevating his eyebrows:—"My dear sir! all you have to do
                     to ascertain the whereabouts of the middle chapter is to take the last half of
                     the antecedent and the first half of the succeeding at an intermediate position
                     in the numbers, add the two halves together, and according to the addition of
                     vulgar fractions you will have it entire, preserving the principle in
                     philosophy in perfection. But I, having some regard to the current 
                        superstitution
                        superstition
                     , that 'there is luck in odd numbers,' and not desiring to compel a
                     descent to vulgar fractions, if any one desire to discover the middle, have
                     decided to retain the original odd number of chapters in the original MS.,
                     though I think the story would read equally as well divided into chapters
                     numbering one more."
                  
                     Cynic:—Impatiently, but laughing; and I suspect, having held this
                     formidable question in reserve from the commencement:—
                  "And how about Eternity?"
                  
                     Writer:—"Sir! My dear sir! You astonish me! You!
                     living in the midst of the enlightenment of the nineteenth century, asking such
                     a question as that! Eternity, sir, is superior. It compasses and envelopes all
                     geometric science. Eternity is all middle. It has no verges; never
                     has had, and never can have, limits."
                  
                     Cynic:—Delightedly:—"You are right old friend, you are right. I
                     desired a little eloquence and I have obtained it."
                  
                     Little Miss Pert,*
                      one of a quartette to whom I have just been reading the first two
                     chapters of the story, listens admiringly to my emphatics, but with curiosity
                     concerning the heroine paramount in her imagination, now breaks in:—
                  "But you did really marry the smart, sweet little thing when she got old
                     enough, didn't you? Somehow it seems as though the story ends with the second
                     chapter."
                  
                     
                     *An elder sister of the Miss Pert to whom allusion is made in "The Manly
                        Art." See note at close. N. S. R. B.
                  
                  All the company were not acquainted with my antecedents.
                  
                     Writer:—"Who! I marry her! Not at all! I am merely rewriting the
                     story for a friend as is stated at the commencement of the first chapter."
                  That friend, by the way, is the Cynic, but none of the company present
                     excepting him and me knew that.
                  "That friend, Miss Pert, declares the printers are all slanderers; and he
                     swears by his wife who is truly lovely, and whom he truly loves, and by his
                     beard which is very long, that he will none of them. And you see, when a man
                     gets so 'cranky' about anything, we must humor him a little, reason with him a
                     little more, and try to cure him of his faults; and if we can't affect him in
                     this manner, why, then we must try and nourish into life all the latent good there is in him, and bring it
                     into action, and this effected, perhaps in time we may reform him;
                     consequently, acting on the foregoing principles, I have succeeded after much
                     beleaguering, in awakening in his mind a sense of justice toward the world, and
                     he has consented, after a long while, that I may rewrite his story and publish
                     it to the world."
                  As I finished my speech I glanced "severely kind" at the Cynic, who I perceived
                     was chewing the "cud"—polite: quid—of sweet and bitter fancy. He understood the
                     kindly sarcasm of my language and manner, and maintained a discreet
                     silence.
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"Oh!"
                  Says Miss Dimond:—Looking up into my face archly and
                     tantalizingly:—
                  "Were you never married? Anna says not; but it is rumored you have left a wife
                     behind you in your old home. Which am I to believe, rumor or her?"*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *Miss Dimond's cousin the Cynic's wife.
                  
                  
                     Writer:—"No Miss! Thank you for your frankness. I belong to the
                     tribe called old bachelors; that class which is supposed to never trouble
                     itself particularly about the affections."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—Who has been waiting anxiously, eager to keep her
                     place:—"Do tell us! Are those names—Eureka, and Nelson, and so on, really and
                        bona fide, true?"
                  
                     Writer:—"They are fictitious as used, barring a single exception,
                     and the name constituting that exception, is, for a sufficient reason, no
                     longer borne by the person to whom it belongs; but I shall desire Miss Pert to
                     curb her curiosity for the present in this particular, as that reason will
                     appear in the proper place during the continuance of the story, or at its
                     close, if desired."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—A little sorely: thinking she felt a slight caustic
                     and rebuff in my language, and that she ought to retaliate—as women always
                     think under such circumstances—suddenly, and without warning, changed the
                     subject; cutting in:—
                  "Well! I don't care! But I should think you might leave the writing of heroic
                     literature to women."
                  
                     Writer:—Surprised:—"My dear Miss Pert, I am aware that of late
                     years women would be pleased to, and perhaps are endeavoring to, make heroic
                     literature a specialty—a peculiar province of theirs; but I do not deem that as
                     a reason why the masculine brain, which is, certainly, more powerful in the
                     aggregate, should relinquish its right to amuse and instruct in any innocent
                     and lawful manner that it may choose. Neither my notions of justice nor of
                     chivalry will uphold me in the practice of any such nonsense."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"Forgive me for my ill-nature, you dear old bachelor.
                     I think I was wrong."
                  
                     Writer:—"Freely, Miss Pert; and in return for your graceful
                     concession, I will say to you individually—but you must not impart the
                     information to a third person—that, in the matter of portraying the emotions of
                     the heart and their operations, the female romancist is, usually, as much
                     superior to the male as the sun is to the moon."
                  Miss Pert appeared to be exceedingly gratified with this bit of honest
                     diplomacy of mine, but before she had opened her always ready and always pretty
                     mouth in reply, young Bluff-'Em-Off,*
                      a promising youth of eighteen who was just "beginning to feel his
                     oats," as we country people style that sort of thing, not liking the tone which
                     the conversation was beginning to assume, clamorously broke forth with:
                  "O hang your nonsense! That Eureka—queer name for a girl, an't it? but that
                     Eureka was of the right sort. Prime! That's enough for me. I wish the story
                     ended with the second chapter, I'd hunt her up and marry her myself. Just about
                     my age by this time, an't she?"
                  
                     *Mr. Dewitt C. Dimond. N. S. R. B.
                  
                  He glanced, as he concluded his burst of eloquence, admiringly, though unaware
                     of her identity with Eureka, at his cousin the Cynic's beautiful young wife who
                     had just then entered the room.
                  
                     Cynic:—A little jealously, though I am sure there was not the

                     Bluff-'Em-Off:—With a whistle long drawn under his breath, having
                     given more attention to the Cynic's manner than to his language:—

                     occasion, playfully prove herself very sarcastic, here interrupted, thus
                     perhaps allaying the discordant spirit which might have bred trouble; though I
                     think there was no danger; both men were gentlemen:—

                     Writer:—"In very brief time. I am now about adjourning to my room

                     interpolate as fast as my brain will execute. I work only evenings, certainly,
                     but I think I can promise you the sequel within a week."
                  Saying which, I gathered together my manuscript and departed. Arriving in my
                     room in the chambers—those girls called it my den—I arranged my materials, sat
                     down to my round table, and wrote:—
               
               
                  MR. BASCOM'S NARRATIVE—Continued.
                  Broderick Dare was a Southerner by birth. His father was descended of ancestors
                     who claimed kinship with that Virginia Dare whose name God immortalized by
                     calling her, a first sacrifice of European energy to the far-reaching and awful
                     American Solitudes.
                  Owning a fair estate in Virginia, and remembering his parentage with pride, he
                     carried his head pretty high, and aspired to carry it higher. Not content with
                     the competency that has sustained many a Virginia gentleman in easy, simple
                     dignity through the peaceful years of a long and pleasant lifetime, his active
                     brain stimulating him to aspire for that power which large wealth can command,
                     he sold his fine patrimonial estate in Virginia and removed to Baltimore.
                  Constantly casting his thoughts about in search of sources whence he might
                     increase his wealth, his mind eventually and permanently rested on stocks. For
                     many years the father of Broderick Dare visited the handsome edifice which is
                     so fitly hidden away just off Broadway among the mazes of dark alleys and
                     streets in lower New York. For many years he visited that classic structure
                     where New York and the Western World principally do their gambling, and there
                     gambled in that seething whirl until he lost his patrimony and his temper,
                     fought a duel, was mortally wounded, and was carried home to Baltimore to
                     die.
                  He read commercial and stock bulletins for half a lifetime, faithfully
                     searching for some alchemist's crucible which should transmute the baser metals
                     into gold, and—failed.
                  Broderick buried and mourned for his father. Then, at twenty-one, alone in the
                     world—he was an only child, and his mother had died in his infancy—he asked
                     himself that fateful question which has puzzled so many, and which has often
                     been so sadly answered:—
                  "What shall I do?"
                  Poverty crowding close, he soon began to look earnestly about himself for means
                     with which to continue his existence. Averse, like most of the Southern gentry
                     of his day, to severe manual labor, the work that "niggers" did could not, of
                     course, be accepted under any circumstances. Therefore, young, ambitious,
                     desirous to maintain respectability, and determined not to be dependent on
                     others, he naturally turned his attention to the professions.
                  The ministry, medicine, and law, were for various reasons set aside; and, as it
                     eventually proved, he unfortunately devoted his abilities to Authorship.
                  He was a young man of some talent and considerable genius, and might have
                     succeeded had he not inherited that old, hasty, turbulent temper, which had, in
                     his father, desecrated the peaceful shades of what are now the inviting hills
                     and picturesque, romantic ravines of Prospect Park, Brooklyn, with the darker,
                     sanguinary gloom of blood.
                  His first writings, written immediately after his father's death, received a
                     fair welcome from the Press. But, in seeking for fame and the consequent
                     emoluments and enjoyments it may command, he had not counted on, and could not,
                     and would not, and did not, pass serenely unheeded, rebuff and aspersion from
                     unexpected quarters.
                  First, the critics—not being bought to his interests—to try his temper and
                     quality, lashed him for his temerity and pretentiousness.
                  His retorts, keen and fiery, showing that their blows had struck, only caused
                     them to increase their efforts, and soon they were scourging him
                     unmercifully.
                  He fought bravely and well. He always retaliated, and his replies were always
                     truthful and to the point, but what did that avail, when, the devil being
                     awakened within him, those retorts
                     were also tinged with the spirit of malignancy. A man will forgive anything
                     sooner than a blow struck in spite. Or what would it have availed had he been
                     blessed with the spirit and temper of a Socrates? When the leashes are thrown
                     from the hounds they are not easily stayed until they have brought down the
                     quarry. You know how it is.
                  And so, the critics, though themselves the aggressors, feeling acutely the
                     stinging pain in the gashes he had slashed into them, sat behind their
                     entrenchments, secure, and launched at him their shafts of satire, of
                     invective, of double-entendre, etc., etc., now tipped with a venom more
                     poisonous than anything he had conceived. They, an army against one, maddened
                     him to desperation. His feelings, not at all concealed, became bitterly and
                     personally revengeful towards them; and theirs to him.
                  Continuing the warfare, soon the better brethern in his profession, remarking
                     the uncontrolled spite with which he launched forth his diatribes—what though
                     they were in reply to those more malicious and equally deadly in intent; he was
                     young, untried, and had not secured his place, while the critics were
                     established paramount—began to give an occasional thrust.
                  Though the approaches of his brother Authors were made in a spirit not
                     altogether uncharitable at first, and though they were made in that manner so
                     well known to the craft, wherein the aggressor cannot be singled out and held
                     personally accountable, it being impossible to fix the attack with any
                     particular person and mark it as designed to be personal; nevertheless, they
                     were understood as desiring to interfere with what was none of their business,
                     and were treated accordingly. Then they too began to slash in, or silently
                     dropped him.
                  Thus matters progressed from bad to worse; and presently, critics, Authors, and
                     all, were ringing an infernal din against his consciousness.
                  Printers soon joining in the war manifested toward him by universal Authordom,
                     the result was that the proud, free, shining banner that he had unfurled gaily
                     in the morning was trailed in the dust by his enemies long enough before noon.
                     He sought the bottle to drown his woes, and at the age of twenty-three,
                     Broderick Dare found himself prostrated by liquor in the Philadelphia gutter,
                     penniless, homeless, without a friend; no publisher that would listen to him;
                     with a motherless young child crying for food; ruin staring him sternly and
                     frowningly in the face.
                  If we shall consider success in Authorship as of vital consequence to Broderick
                     Dare, then he did just what he ought not to have done, unless, like Byron, he
                     had had the pecuniary means with which to sustain himself.
                  Probably had he had the command of large wealth and been also sustained by high
                     hereditary social influence, as in Byron's case, he would have succeeded, for
                     their cases in other respects were not altogether dissimilar, but he had
                     nothing—absolutely nothing on which to depend but his own unaided energies.
                     Those energies would have served him well had he been deaf to the critics and
                     controlled his temper; that he did not, and the bottle and the gutter were the
                     result.
                  One alone, among all, Edgar A. Poe, had always remained his steadfast friend,
                     but Poe was now gone to New York, though even if he had remained where his
                     sympathy would have been of value to young Dare—sympathy being all he would
                     have accepted from any one—it may be that his gloomy genius would have been
                     more of an injury than would the sympathy a benefit; but of that I will not
                     judge; that Poe did give him human sympathy and
                     kindness—friendship—when they were together, is sufficient for laudable mention
                     and remembrance.
                  So now, all alone, disgusted with everything, weary, at war with the world,
                     naked as may be said, and a confirmed lover of strong drink, at twenty-four,
                     Broderick Dare had the resolution—I think he never lacked in that respect—to
                     take his daintily bred person and his young child and turn his face to the
                     solitude.
                  When I first made his acquaintance he had been for eight years a dweller on the
                     mountain in the vicinity of the village of S—, his only means of support an
                     annuity of a hundred dollars a year his father had had the forethought to
                     purchase for him before casting the last remnant of his fortune into the
                     engulphing vortex presided over by Mammon in that beautiful Temple*
                      of carved stone which stands
                     
                        
                        *Its predecessor I suppose. The Broker's Exchange, or whatever it may have
                           been named, must have been destroyed by the Great Fire which swept

                           R. B.
                     
                     laughing defiance in the face of Old Trinity in lower New York.
                  His history I learned from his own lips, having sought him in his place of
                     abode after the morning of refined pleasure I had enjoyed in the society of his
                     little daughter, Eureka; a name, sad to say, that he had given her to humiliate
                     a member of his profession.
                  The circumstance making quite a little anecdote, I will relate it. One of
                     Broderick's bitterest enemies was a proud, supercilious young fellow, an editor
                     for one of the departments in one of the Philadelphia dailies. As it happened
                     at the time, he had collected in his pocket in current checks and bank bills,
                     some four thousand dollars. As vain young men often do, he had repeatedly, when
                     the question came up, been heard to declare that no pickpocket, however clever,
                     could get to his purse unbeknown to him. Broderick had heard him repeat the
                     boast when they were formerly on better terms, and was therefore well
                     acquainted with this particular weakness of his.
                  Proceeding along Sansom and other streets in his usual manner from the
                     Editorial Rooms of the paper on which he was employed to his Hotel, on the
                     evening when he had the four thousand dollars on his person, the young boaster
                     was relieved of the entire amount. The next day the loss was published
                     throughout the city. The day after, Broderick paid liberally for a short notice
                     among the editorial notes in one of the leading dailies;—he paid because his
                     enemies were already numerous.
                  It read thus:—Singular Name:—We learn that the young aspirant for literary honors, Broderick Dare, has named
                     his infant daughter, Eureka.
                  This raised a great laugh at the victim from their numerous mutual
                     acquaintances who had often heard them converse, themselves often joining in,
                     and who well understood, with regard to this method of communicating ideas. To
                     be laughed at in his present sensitive state of mind, and that the laugh had
                     been provoked by an enemy—he had of course seen the point at once—was more than
                     he could patiently endure. He resolved that the young father should suffer for
                     his temerity. He immediately, whip in hand, sought the offending young Dare,
                     meaning to cowhide him. When he left him he was a wiser if not a better man. He
                     lost his whip, and got—cowhided.
                  The four thousand dollars were never recovered, though the young editor who had
                     had his self-conceit humbled twice so effectually had the satisfaction to learn
                     that it was a London expert just arrived in town who had relieved him of his
                     fortune. The humiliation had been visited on him by a master in the
                     profession.
                  When I first became acquainted with Broderick Dare, he was a young man in the
                     prime of life, of noble presence, and with a yet full, strong voice, though
                     there was blood in his eye and the marks of the debasing influence of liquor
                     stamped on his countenance.
                  He acknowledged to me, unasked, that he yet obtained liquor when he could, and
                     drank it, and thought he always should. But his child since his residence on
                     the mountain had never suffered for food or clothing, nor ever should suffer so
                     long as he had life. He was positive in this. He had thought a great deal since
                     his brief literary career in Philadelphia, and had now taken the resolution
                     that he would work like a "nigger" before she should want for bread. He meant
                     it.
                  As I learned his history, gathered from conversations had with him at various
                     times during an interval of about a week, that being about the length of time I
                     remained longer in the vicinity of S—, the conviction gradually assumed the
                     direction in my mind, as I have already narrated it, that Broderick Dare,
                     however much he might be blamed as harming his interests in his manner of
                     conducting his war with those connected with the Press, still had right on his
                     side; and while I pitied his degradation as I beheld it in externals and in the
                     influence that liquor had obtained over his capable mind, I could not but
                     admire the heroism which had voluntarily and I believe, wittingly, too,
                     sacrificed fame, wealth, everything, almost, but bare life, rather than
                     relinquish, or even waive for a season, the right to retaliate on unprovoked
                     attack.
                  It was plain to be seen that if he would but have dropped his right for a
                     little time he would soon have risen above his enemies, and might have again
                     easily resumed it after securing position. But the relinquishment his pride and
                     his temper could not, would not, and did not allow him to suffer. And I do not
                     think he regretted the course of action he had pursued when a dweller among
                     men, even under all the present
                     privations, all the present misery which that course of action had entailed.
                     Yet, as he had sought a solace in rum, and this was a source of great grief to
                     his daughter—as he well knew, for he loved the child and was keen-sighted to
                     discover the cause of her sorrows, though she usually controlled her emotions
                     of grief admirably, being prompted thereto by the strong bond of love that
                     existed between them—yet, I say, as his habits of intoxication were a source of
                     deep sorrow to his daughter, I think he sometimes indulged regrets on her
                     account that he was not in better circumstances and had not a better control
                     over his appetites. His paternal affection was strong and warm,
                        always.
                  During my sojourn among the Pennsylvania mountains I learned much of Broderick
                     Dare that was kind, and noble, and true, drunkard that he was. It pleases me to
                     think that he was one of my kind.
                  And his kindness, nobility and truth were of the active, useful sort, too, as
                     he demonstrated in the care he took of the child's education socially and
                     intellectually, as well as to warm her heart and feed and clothe her. He
                     attended to her intellect himself, and sent her to school to get a practical
                     understanding of social knowledge other than he could impart.
                  Previous to the death of his father he had acquired an excellent education in
                     the schools of Baltimore, and this he now bestowed during his sober intervals
                     without stint on his daughter. She did not need to attend school for anything
                     there to be obtained from the books. He was well aware that so far as
                     conventional knowledge is concerned she could gain no advantage by visiting the
                     school-house in the valley; but he reasoned, and rightly too, I think, that for
                     the uses and happiness as of the world when the time should arrive for her to
                     leave his humble hut, as come that time must sooner or later, now was the time
                     for her to gain from an intercourse with her own sex, perhaps some her seniors
                     in years, if not in the mind, a familiar knowledge of the ways of women, and
                     perhaps the establishment of friendships with some of them, that might prove to
                     be of inestimable value. Hence he kept her at school.
                  And Eureka, young as she was, thoroughly and heartily appreciated and responded
                     to her father's care and thoughtfulness for her future. And he regarded it as a
                     recompense, that, at all times, even clear through the obscuring and deadening
                     mists which inebriety exhales to rise and spread over and around the mind to
                     stupefy its preceptions, she had never failed to pierce with the charms of
                     stern integrity and strong natural affection, to the core of his life. He said
                     that when so drunk he could not rise from the floor he never failed to
                     recognize the touch and voice of love from his daughter as distinctly as when
                     there were no alcoholic fumes in his brain. While in the lowest degradation to
                     which liquor ever reduced him, the father had never for a moment forgotten that
                     the child was his daughter. He had never struck her a blow—never grieved her
                     affectionate heart with a harsh word.
                  I believe it. When a boy I was once too drunk to raise my head from the floor,
                     or the ground rather, but I know I retained control of my faculties well enough
                     to reason intelligently, though I suppose their numbers are few whose intellect
                     liquor will not prostrate in company with the person.
                  Save the one failing of his—he had but one failing to her, a failing which she
                     could not conquer for him, nor was his love, strong as it was, yet strong
                     enough to induce him to become a self-conqueror—the drunkard loved his daughter
                     with an absoluteness and entireness of the heart seldom witnessed in the walks
                     of human life.
                  It is almost needless to have said as I have, that, with a girl of Eureka's
                     character and temperament her father's affection was cherished and returned
                     with a constant and equable ardency such as natures as hers are alone capable
                     of experiencing.
                  While my brief and happy intercourse with Broderick Dare continued, I daily
                     discovered more and more, something to admire in the ways, the intellect, and
                     the heart of his winsome, most lovely child.
                  I gave her more than one horse-back ride to the schoolhouse in the valley; and
                     was more than once charmed with the justness and appropriateness of her remarks
                     on the scenery—concerning the views to be had from different points of
                     observation—of their different values as capable to produce emotions and
                     sensations, both separately and when brought into juxtaposition and
                     contrast.
                  
                  Young as she was, I found her capable of giving expression to a refined and
                     appreciative admiration of nature. Yes, she was an appreciative admirer of
                     nature in all the varied, wonderful, and sometimes grand phases she assumes in
                     the vicinity of the Pennsylvania drunkard's old home.
                  Her soul was amply commensurate to measure the sublimities of crag and cliff of
                     Susquehanna and Juniata, of the higher Alleghanies of Virginia, of the White
                     Mountains, the far-off, lordly Sierras, or even of the awful precipices of
                     Colorado and Yosemite.
                  And in matters of morality and the intellect—with regard to the affections and
                     purposes of the heart and the mind; her instincts, intuitions and
                     perceptions—her education, seemed to be more complete and perfect than that of
                     other women who are at the zenith of their powers.
                  
                     She unerringly traveled in proper paths.
                  But time progressed, and I bade adieu to Broderick Dare and his daughter,
                     promising to again visit their hut at some future time. Strange! How strange it
                     does sometimes appear to us, that after events, when they have arrived, had not
                     been divined before. Strange! Strange! But profoundly as I was impressed with
                     her beauty and merits—fascinated is not too strong a word to use
                     in the connection—I did not then realize that Eureka belonged to me. She has
                     since assured me that simultaneously with the adventure of the snake the
                     conviction began to grow surely and firmly, and weave itself inextricably into
                     her young life, that, at some time in the future I should become her protector
                     for always.
                  Can it be, as some people claim, that, a powerful will, clinging tenaciously
                     and with firm faith, for years, and even with thousands of miles and no
                     communication between, can bring to pass a dear and cherished desire? Can one
                     will thus act on another? Was this what impelled me again to the dear girl's
                     side after six years of separation? Could her strong, tenacious, faithful
                     affections, sent out by her as an Inspiration of Love, permeate space, with a
                     thousand miles and six long years of separation between, and thus operate on
                     mine? If so, then why is her mind now subject to mine, as I know, and as she
                     most thoroughly acknowledges? Why is not she the superior? Who can
                     satisfactorily answer such apparently wild speculations?
                  I bade adieu to Broderick Dare and his daughter: no acknowledged thought in my
                     mind of the closest of companionship with her in the future; traveled for
                     several days among the iron beds of the State, and concluded my Pennsylvania
                     tour with a visit to the great iron foundries at Pittsburg.
                  I returned to New York; was four years a dweller in the world, quaffing large
                     draughts of pleasure with the pleasure seekers; and again, discussing questions
                     pertaining to science, art, and discovery, with the learned. I visited
                     agreeably many of the temples of learning in the great Eastern cities, besides
                     lingering at nearly all the fashionable places of summer resort; and
                     occasionally sojourned in the country for a season, delighting in rural
                     occupations and recreations and in the strong good sense of the farmers.
                  During the time, Eureka was remembered, but almost indifferently. At last,
                     however, the impulse, strong, and like a flood, swept in upon my consciousness
                     and bade me seek the little girl of ten, now fourteen, and witness if time had
                     kept the miracle renewed.
                  Once more I left the familiar scenes and enjoyments of home and of the world
                     and sought the Pennsylvania wild. Once more I traversed glen, mountain, and
                     river; surveyed crag, cliff, rock and tree, worshiping at the Almighty's Oldest
                     Shrine.
                  Again I stood on the well-remembered spot where first the vision had gladdened
                     my sight. The stone of sharp corners, whereon I had dashed the serpent, was
                     still there, the same. The fragment of rock of which I had made a convenient
                     seat, and whereon I had held the engaging little girl in my lap; the pure
                     running water; the grouping of hills; the trees and shrubs; the heavenly
                     shining dew on the grass in the clear, warm morning light; the deer; the
                     squirrel, and the bird were all the same, but—no Eureka. Her presence was sadly
                     wanting to complete the cherished picture.
                  Sadly, with a feeling of dread—a womanly premonition of evil defining itself in
                     my mind, I wended my way to the hut of the drunkard. It was deserted; desolate.
                     Rank nettles grew in the doorway; rank ivy clambered the moldering walls, and
                     the bead-like eyes of the serpent glittered in the chinks between the logs.
                  
                  Where was Broderick Dare?
                  Anxiously I turned away and directed my course to the nearest neighbor's, some
                     two miles distant. Arrived there, I inquired:—
                  It was that old, old story, so often, and always sounding so sadly when
                        told:—"mania a potu."
                  "Where was the poor man's daughter?"
                  "She had gone west soon after her bereavement, with some family or other—who
                     had lived away in some direction or other, they could not tell where—of some
                     name or other, they could not tell what."
                  I traversed the country for miles around, seeking information; and this was
                     what I learned:—Many families of poor people had emigrated recently. After the
                     decease of her father, his daughter had been taken by some one of these poor
                     families to some far western State; Iowa, or Missouri, or Arkansas, or some
                     other; that was all; neither name nor certain destination could I
                     ascertain.
                  Who should have cared to interest themselves about a miserable drunkard's
                     child?
                  The few of her former schoolmates who yet remained in the vicinity were all
                     oblivious as to knowledge of her whereabouts. Like herself her best friends
                     were all gone west. Miss H—, an itinerating school-mistress, had gone, no one
                     knew whither. Old Aunt Patsy was dead, and Old Jube, of bottle
                     fame, didn't care a d—n.
                  Why had I not left my address with Eureka or her father in provision for such
                     an emergency as had occurred? In sorrow I acknowledged myself culpable, and
                     then for the first time, when, seemingly, she was lost to me, I knew how well I
                     had been guarding in my memory and affections the welfare of the little girl
                     who was only ten summers old.
                  Reader! I had learned to love the child with a love that I now
                     knew was likely to prove to be such love as that with which man regards
                     woman.
                  The happy knowledge, gained simultaneously with the knowledge of my loss
                     spurred me to instant and resolute action. It was no time for indecision. The
                     longer I delayed the less likely I should be to get a clue to her whereabouts;
                     and I felt, that after her father, my right to discover and constitute myself
                     her protector was indisputable. I acted.
                  As the speediest and surest agency of which I could think to summon to my aid
                     for the discovery of Eureka, I proceeded to the West and advertised. For two
                     years, besides traveling and inquiring personally and constantly, I kept a
                     standing advertisement in every newspaper in existence north of Louisiana and
                     between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains.
                  All availed me nothing. I received nothing in return concerning the girl I
                     loved but a silence as profound as that of the dead.
                  
                  Before closing this chapter the Author will remark that it may appear singular
                     to those unacquainted with the seclusions of the West, that so thorough an
                     advertising should not have been rewarded with success, as during the entire
                     time, the girl was really residing in the West; but it is not really so very
                     remarkable, as the reader may readily understand after a little
                     explanation.
                  The Author, while once traveling in the Western wilds, discovered a cluster of
                     three or four families whose cabins were advantageously grouped together in and
                     around a picturesque and secluded ravine, who devoured with avidity news
                     imparted by him from the outside world that was more than three months old. The
                     melons in their gardens were delicious, luscious; their potato patches
                     prolific; their vegetables splendid; their stores of corn and wheat abundant.
                     They had large herds of the finest of cattle; droves of fleet horses, which the
                     wild girls and wilder boys rode like the hurricane; but there was not a
                     newspaper among them; and entirely sequestered as they were, they had not
                     received and entertained a visitor for months, from the land of civilization,
                     until the arrival of the Author and friend.
                  It is not surprising then, that Eureka did not chance upon the Advertisement,
                     her protector having in this manner entirely withdrawn himself from the
                     world.
                  Yet, you may ask, why should not some friend or acquaintance have read the
                     Advertisement and have informed her of its purport; she must certainly have met
                     some one during the course of the two years who would have seen it? Ah! yes,
                     most certainly, and thereby depends another explanation which will be given in
                     due season.
               
               
                  
                  IV.
                  HE.
                  MR. BASCOM'S NARRATIVE—Continued.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *The colloquial commencement of this chapter is interpolated; I can
                        imagine so well how he would have spoken in the circumstances. N. S. R.
                        B.
                  
                  "He, is myself."
                  "And who are you?" growls some crochety reader, dissatisfied with the
                     appropriation.
                  "O! as I have formerly and finely said to the charming Miss Dare:—I am Nelson
                     Bascom, at your service, my dear sir, madam or miss, as you happen to be;
                     considering myself as competent to write this narrative as any one who is less
                     acquainted with the circumstances, and, saving the frequent recurrence of the
                     egotistical pronoun, I shall, when it is completed, have the presumption to
                     pronounce it well written."
                  "I don't care anything at all about that!"
                  "Don't you? Well! It is the sense of secret, inward satisfaction that gives the
                     greatest joy; and I'm sure you are, growler though you be, sufficiently
                     charitable to allow me to enjoy undisturbed my little inward
                     self-glorification; especially when I am taking so much trouble to myself in
                     order to amuse and hopefully to instruct."
                  "O! that's all right! Go ahead with your story!"
                  "Yes! I suppose you are anxious to learn of the history of the great hero in
                     this veritable romance, having already laughed in your sleeve at his falling in
                     love with what you termed—what was it you called her? I didn't quite
                     understand. Oblige me by repeating the term?"
                  "A little chit of a girl."
                  "A little chit of a girl? Softly there, my very dear friend, or I
                     strike. Have you forgotten that this little girl is growing, is pure, and is
                     blessed with store of excellences unsurpassable?"
                  "'Beg your pardon!' Did you say, Mr. Growler?"
                  "Yes! I don't want to quarrel about anything so inconsequential."
                  "Yes! It strikes me it is eminently proper not to quarrel."
                  "Well! are you going to tell about yourself or not?"
                  "To be sure I am! but you needn't be so impatient. You'll get enough of me
                     before I'm through!"
                  "I don't doubt that, but go ahead, will you?"
                  "O well! Hold your temper and listen!"
                  "Yes, I'm listening."
                  "Now then, as the quick-witted and energetic sometimes say:—'here goes.'"
                  My youthful years were spent on the farm and at the district school in the
                     State of New York.
                  On the farm I plowed and hoed, pitched and mowed, and swung the grain cradle
                     with the sturdiest of the farming youth.
                  At the district school I held my own with the best, the smartest, and the
                     merriest; was as good as any at playing "ball," "pull-away," or "flint-eye;"
                     kissed the girls oftener; and whether owing to my own peculiar, superior way of
                     managing matters, or to some other indescribable charm, got whipped the least
                     of anybody—in truth, was never whipped at all; kept my place at the head of all
                     the classes—even my partiality for the girls could not induce me to show them
                     favor in this respect—and won all the prizes.
                  Wasn't I a prodigy and a paragon? Not exactly a complete combination and
                     blending of the valuable qualities composing the charming characters of the
                     gallant John Smith and the most "Admirable Crichton," perhaps, but next door
                     neighbors to each, "you know."
                  Youth advancing on toward maturity, I wrestled and ran with the sturdiest and
                     toughest oaks among our farming people; cut the "bullies" out of their swaths
                     in the hay and grain fields; visited Academic Halls and read the classics and
                     declaimed eloquence to the muses, with a sibyl enthroned as presiding Goddess
                     or Genius, whom we supposed to listen unseen in Academic groves for the special
                     purpose of encouraging and imbuing our ardent young souls with Demosthenic or
                     Ciceronic eloquence and fire.
                  But ah! those potent magicians of fairy-land may not really have visited our
                     groves, those groves being not quite such as those in which those "long-headed"
                     old heathen, Plato and Socrates, taught. Their groves—Central Park with its trees, its shade, its
                     accommodating seats, its lakes of water, and its green grass, except that it is
                     more adorned and beautified, may perhaps, fill the description pretty
                     well—their groves were veritable Academic ground, while ours were properly
                     owned by prosperous farmers who resided in commodious farm-houses contiguous to
                     Academy buildings, and hence the sweet and lovely female band, scorning an
                     alliance, even in a seeming sense, with sordid grimy toil, may have shunned
                     their inviting shades. However, whether I drew inspiration from prophetic
                     Sibyl, or from fostering Clio, Melpomene, Euterpe, and the rest of the classic,
                     instructive train, it must have sought me from some source, for I was often
                     warmly complimented with being "a rising young man."
                  "Who knew but I might be Senator or President; Vice, without doubt!" How happy
                     "the dear five hundred" did make me! So they thought; but I knew the
                     inspiration of my hopes and joys came from a different source.
                  "Well! well! I suppose they meant it all well, yes, I am sure they did; and now
                     those congratulatory days of theirs—days so full of joyous, illusive expectancy
                     to them, on my account, are all passed away—dead like a futile dream, and ought
                     to be hidden from sight and forgotten, only that they conceal a moral that may
                     be of use to some other young beginner.
                  I left Academic shades with shining honors—honors merited; I had fought well
                     for them—as rousing as any in a night street "tussle," and at the head of the
                     first class in learning as it was written out in the pages of the matriculation
                     books. Don't forget my former apt illusion to Messrs. Crichton and Smith.
                  And now, at the mature and buoyant age of one-and-twenty, I discovered myself
                     thrown out upon the world by the honored Academic Alma Mater and the customs of
                     society, to take care of myself. And immediately, every one seemed to say:—
                  "Don't allow yourself to 'spoil' while there is so much to do."
                  I had taught district school one or two winters, and had advantageous offers to
                     continue in that business; also had conditional offers, tendering permanent
                     occupancy of Principals' chairs in High Schools and Academies, and yet I had
                     never been inside of College walls. Crichton again.
                  
                  Physicians, members of all the professions, invited and endeavored to incite me
                     to study and win, respectively, the highest honors of their callings.
                     Merchants, when I stood before their counters and also at their hospitable
                     boards, made occasion in their conversations to spread alluringly before me the
                     wealth of the Indies, East and West, and not forgetting traffic in cotton,
                     tobacco, wool, and the metals.
                  But I waived them all away. They did not know; but I realized that I should
                     murder myself if I confined myself to chair, book, or counter. My superabundant
                     physical vitalities emphatically said that I should study no more; only of the
                     world. And it had been a dream of mine, tenaciously and fondly matured from
                     childhood up, to see the world.
                  I waived the invitations all aside, and did what few intelligent young men of
                     my social standing would have done. While emoluments, honors, fame, all,
                     seemingly, were fondly wooing me to stay where I was and not ruin my fortunes,
                     I proceeded directly to New York, with less than a hundred dollars in my
                     pocket, and sought for some foreign-bound ship. My friends thought me
                     demented—thought I was madly throwing away my flattering chances for the
                     greatest of successes in the great game of life. As I have intimated, I
                        knew that no tame effeminate practice of physician
                     or lawyer could satisfy me. I must have something sterner, bolder, wilder, or
                     be killed by the revulsion of superabundant life thrown back upon itself. Hence
                     I hurried out into the world.
                  On my arrival in New York I sought at once a foreign-bound ship; whither bound
                     I cared but little—designing to see all in time—if so that I could satisfy my
                     raging desire to travel—to enjoy the felicity of motion, and to see and
                     learn.
                  As it happened, threading the mazes of shipping lying along the long line of
                     miles of wharves which engirdle the great city, I applied first to the captain
                     of a vessel bound to California to get a cargo of hides. The captain, his name
                     was P—, refused, decidedly, to engage a hand, and particularly a green one, on
                     the terms I desired; his men must ship for the voyage, or not at all; he would
                     not take a fo'mastman to San Francisco where sailors could scarce be shipped
                     for love or money, and there discharge him.
                  I said but little to Captain P—, after this, not thinking that I could
                     influence his decision; but I would by no means ship for the voyage, however possible it
                     might be that I should desire to immediately continue the return after reaching
                     that port. What I said, or what he saw in me to induce him to change his mind I
                     have never yet learned. At the time, I know, I was somewhat surprised that
                     after I had turned and was leaving his deck, as I supposed finally, he should
                     call to me, rather harshly:—
                  "Come aboard at seven bells you young land-lubber and mark the papers for the
                     run out around the Horn."
                  I did not quite like the epithet, "land-lubber," though it might be but the
                     language of habit; but at any rate it was no part of my policy to allow myself
                     to suffer an incivility of speech to repulse me, if such it were meant to be,
                     so I quietly signified acquiescence and departed.
                  The vessel was all ready for departure. The next day, therefore, we saw the
                     battery and the pretty islands of the bay falling behind us. The breeze
                     favoring, we sailed swiftly down past Greenwood—most beautiful city of all the
                     cities in all the world—escaped safely the ugly claw of Sandy Hook, and soon,
                     making the ocean stream, the sands of Long Island and New Jersey were fast
                     receding in the distance.
                  Despite his gruffness at the outset I found Captain P—7 as I had anticipated I
                     should, a very pleasant man, and before we had rounded the Horn and reached our
                     port, a most agreeable companion; and I desire, if this narrative shall ever
                     reach his eyes, that he will remember that I continue to thank him for that
                     extra can of grog that so frequently sent the warm tingling blood with
                     lightning speed and fever heat to the further extremities of my benumbed
                     fingers and toes while we were fighting desperately with the baffling, biting
                     winds and bitter cold storms that prevailed in the latitude of Fuego when we
                     were there; and also that I am not now sorry I did not resent being named a
                     "land-lubber" as was my first thought to do at the time.
                  It being no part of my plan in writing this sketch of my younger years to give
                     a detail of the voyage out to San Francisco, it is sufficient to say that we
                     arrived at that port in safety, and that there I bade my brother tars an
                     affectionate adieu.
                  With Captain P— it was difficult to part. He had, during our long voyage on the
                     ocean become much attached to me, and offered if I would continue with him, to
                     give me the berth of the second mate on arriving again in New York, with the
                     promise of the first mate's place as soon as I should become qualified to fill
                     it. But this I refused—it interfering with my cherished desire—yet regretfully,
                     I must say, as I saw the good captain brush hastily a salt drop from his eye at
                     parting with me.
                  San Francisco was not at that early day the great, busy, thriving city it is
                     fast becoming. The United States had but lately acquired the valuable territory
                     comprised in California and New Mexico; the country therefore but just 
                        begining
                        beginning
                      to beneficially experience the operation of the excellent laws
                     introduced by Fremont and others, and its mineral resources being comparatively
                     unknown, emigration had not yet set in. Vessels,—great ships and steamers were
                     not then as now arriving and departing daily from the wharves of the great
                     commercial depot of the American Pacific.
                  I speedily learned that I must await for some length of time the sailing of any
                     vessel to China, Great Britain, or any other region of the antipodes. I
                     accordingly availed myself of the opportunity to improve my time with
                     explorations in the interior; designing to return to San Francisco, unless
                     something extraordinary should intervene during the interim, and ship in a
                     British sloop which was to depart for the East Indies and Calcutta in about a
                     month.
                  In pursuance of my plan I left San Francisco and explored the wonders of the
                     present Calaveras County, and then crossed over to the Sacramento, being
                     desirous of acquainting myself somewhat with the capabilities of that fine,
                     even-flowing river for the purposes of navigation, and of ascertaining all I
                     could in general concerning the physical features of the country. I had
                     ascended the Sacramento as far as the Yuba and up that stream a few miles, and
                     was about to commence my return to San Francisco.
                  As a leave-taking to my further explorations into the novelties of that then
                     wilderness country, I was, though it was early spring, bathing in the waters of
                     the Yuba, the tide of the river being unusually low for the season. Diving to
                     the river's bed during my aquatic disport and refreshment my eyes rested on a
                     clear, shining, metallic-looking substance that appeared to be of a peculiar
                        character— something different
                     from common river sand; it seemed to be more luminous, more lustrous than the
                     white grains of silica as usually polished by the friction of water along the
                     courses of streams.
                  I grasped a handful of the glittering stuff and rose to the surface. Examining
                     my trophy I was well enough skilled in metallurgy to pronounce it gold without
                     awaiting a more scientific test.
                  Three days had not elapsed when I learned that gold had also been
                     simultaneously discovered at the Sutter Mill.
                  Such news, when once out, travels as with the wings of the messenger bird. The
                     country, sparsely settled as it was, was soon in a blaze of excitement.
                     Everybody rushed up the Sacramento for gold; many so precipitately that they
                     were forced to return to San Francisco and prepare an outfit before they could
                     proceed. I acted with promptness but also employed forethought. There was only
                     one old fellow, and he a hunter, who was always ready for any emergency, who
                     preceded me during my search for gold; marks of his trail, solitary and alone,
                     I discovered wherever I went while on the Yuba. He started out from San
                     Francisco the day of my return there, after the discovery.
                  Reflecting that, as the gold I had discovered was a deposit of the water, and
                     joining with this what I had gathered from reading, that in all the gold
                     districts of the world which had as yet been discovered, excepting some of the
                     sands of Africa, those ranges of hills having a general polar bearing alone
                     contained the gold, I reasoned that heavy ranges of hills of this description
                     were undoubtedly all auriferous, and hence the American Nevada must be a mass
                     of treasure.
                  With my idea for a base, I immediately formed a party for exploration and
                     adventure; being pretty sure I should discover a vast fountain of the precious
                     metal in the mountains.
                  The party was formed with the understanding that it should continue together;
                     its members to give one another all needful assistance in general, but every
                     individual to retain to himself all he might find. I might have readily made up
                     a party in the understanding that all findings should be hoarded in a common
                     fund until the cessation of our labors, when we should divide, taking share and
                     share alike; but knowing the free American spirit better likes to control its
                     own individual gains, I preferred to conduct operations as stated; therefore
                     with that arrangement we commenced the ascent of the Yuba to the mountains.
                  The company numbered five members. Each had two good strong mules, two small
                     sacks for gold, now filled with sea-biscuit, a small sack of salt, and a pick
                     and shovel; this, reckoning in, each a rifle, a double-barrelled pistol, and
                     the necessary ammunition, together with knives, was our entire preparation.
                     There having been no miners in the country previous to this time, we
                     anticipated starting sufficient game to supply most of the food we should need
                     while on our explorations.
                  We ascended the Yuba, continuing up the main stream to its source. We used the
                     pick and shovel but seldom; the river growing shallow as we ascended we picked
                     up peas, walnuts and nuggets of gold from its bed in sufficient quantities to
                     satisfy my most sanguine anticipations. We obtained all our gold in this way
                     except some rich "hauls" made from the pools with a wooden rake
                     that we manufactured with our knives while on the tour.
                  After climbing to near the source of the main stream of the Yuba, we explored
                     several of the collateral branches, and with such success as to demonstrate to
                     my perfect satisfaction that the Nevada must be one vast Aurifodina. This has
                     since been proved to the world to be the case as the world well knows.
                  After we had completed our explorations and our labors, my sacks were exceeding
                     weighty with gold. I had both my bread sacks filled, my salt sack, and two
                     sacks made from the sleeves of my shirt, a strong, serviceable article with
                     which I had provided myself previous to commencing the "prospecting" tour; in
                     fact, all the available bagging I could command and contrive with my resources
                     was crammed and crowded with gold.
                  Its weight, as subsequently ascertained in San Francisco, was more than six
                     hundred pounds. My two mules acknowledged the weight before I had arrived in
                     that city.
                  Although, with a single exception, no other member of the company had succeeded
                     so well and collected as much as myself, yet, the least obtained by any
                     individual of the party was weighed and valued in San Francisco at more than twenty thousand dollars; and
                     what is remarkable, the gold of the individual who succeeded as well as myself
                     weighed with mine, ounce for ounce.
                  The old hunter mentioned as preceding me, a Carolinian by birth, we met just
                     before we had completed the ascent of the Yuba. His mule was staggering under
                     more than it could conveniently carry in its course towards the haunts of men.
                     I saw him after our return to the city when he informed me that he made short,
                     easy stages, and often "toted" a hundred pounds or so himself for half a day
                     while on his way in. His gatherings weighed five hundred and nineteen pounds
                     and five ounces.
                  And now, after the lapse of less than four months succeeding my first landing
                     in San Francisco, I was again in that city, the possessor of wealth ample to
                     meet all my reasonable desires.
                  A government train being about to start for the "States" soon after our return
                     from the gold fields, I, together with two others of my company availed
                     ourselves of the opportunity to join our fortunes with it for the journey. The
                     other two of the company had already organized a party of eight, and were about
                     proceeding again to the mountains, now intending to trace up the main
                     Sacramento.
                  We proceeded with the government train via
                     the Texas route, reaching New Orleans without molestation, excepting one or two
                     brushes with the Comanches. Thence, I continued directly on to New York,
                     arriving there safely, soon after, with my treasure, and having been absent
                     from that city but little more than eighteen months.
                  I immediately visited Wall street where I secured a large portion of my gold in
                     stocks, principally of the best railroads. Another large portion I employed to
                     purchase land of the farmers residing in my native town. I bought of them about
                     five hundred acres in all. And knowing the instability of all human governments
                     and all human affairs, I had reserved a third and smaller fraction of my
                     findings, but still a considerable moiety, which I subsequently invested in the
                     British consols
                  The relation of my travel having now brought me happily again to my native
                     State, I will not proceed further in the narrative without saying that I left
                     California with regret.
                  During my brief sojourn in that wonderful State, then Territory, I learned that
                     so far as Nature may be of value in conducing to the happiness and enjoyments
                     of life, it is probable that there is no State in the Union so desirable as a
                     permanent place of residence as is California.
                  Its unrivaled climate, clear skies and pure air; its magnificent Sylva and
                     Flora; its pure mountain streams, watering and fructifying its virgin soil of
                     inexhaustible fertility; its marvelous scenery—mountain lakes fairer than a
                     poet's dream; its grand Nevada sheltering gorges and Sierras more wild and
                     rugged, more mysterious and solemn in their still, vast, and appalling heights
                     and extents than almost anything the world can elsewhere produce—the rude,
                     bold, singular, and many, many wonderful forms discoverable in the aspects of
                     the defiles, the acclivities, the precipices, are now alluringly beckoning me
                     thither again; and perhaps I shall yet return and make my home in that enticing
                     land; though fertile fields, abounding sublime natural scenery—the splendid
                     Hudson and the soft Genesee, Niagara, beautiful Catskills and fierce
                     Adirondacks; the attachments of my youth, friends and relatives, are with the
                     good old mother, the greatest and grand Empire State, New York.
                  Having now ample means with which to prosecute in a becoming manner my desire
                     for travel, I accordingly made the tour of Europe; profitably I believe. I also
                     ransacked Asia and Africa in search of knowledge and fatigue, and after a
                     sojourn of five years in strange lands returned again among familiar home
                     scenes, holding in my mind stores of information regarding what I had heard and
                     seen and with my pulses measurably quieted.
                  I may at some future time write a history of my travels in detail, as I have
                     beheld and learned much that is curious and interesting; but my present purpose
                     in giving this outline of my life is merely to instruct the reader
                     sufficiently, that he may intelligently judge what sort of character is the
                     hero of this story, the lover of Eureka Dare, queen of women.
                  After my return to the United States from my foreign travels I was earnestly
                     solicited by my friends to allow myself to be brought before the people as a
                     candidate for Congressional honors. Not having formed a very high estimate of
                     the Senatorial dignity as it existed at that time, I demurred. My excellent friends persisting, and
                     appearing to feel much hurt at my disinclination to gratify their desires I
                     finally yielded and allowed myself to stand on the canvass, though I knew very
                     well I should spurn with contempt the business of legislation as it would be
                     conducted, and should never suffer a re-election to transpire under any
                     circumstances.
                  
                     But they did not know.
                  I knew as well when I was twenty years old that I should never fill political
                     place, as I know it now. Not but that I believed I had talents enough, but
                     because I knew I could never degrade myself to meet familiarly in Council those
                     who would constantly thrust out their gigantic frauds and their many
                     duplicities to the acceptance of a confiding people, and who would persevere,
                     too, in spite of all I could do to prevent, until they should get them
                     accepted. But my friends, not knowing my feelings, and meaning all for the
                     best, as I have formerly intimated, sought to give me what they regarded as
                     preferment. They never knew what I thought—how thoroughly I despised all shams
                     and treacheries—and never will until they read these lines.
                  You see, my friends, I was not quite perfect myself. The price of peace in
                     those old times was—silence. Had I spoken "the truth, the
                        whole truth, and nothing but the truth," how soon would nearly
                     all of ye have hooted me as a dreamer, as crazy, or as a fool!
                  Now, I do not care. I say what I choose. My place in the world I believe to be
                     established, and unjust judgments cannot harm me.
                  I was elected to Congress. Subsequently, at the proper time, I proceeded to
                     Washington, was qualified, and took my seat among the National Representatives
                     in the Capitol.
                  I will give a sample of my Congressional experience and dismiss the theme. It
                     shall be a portrayal in outline, of a supposed debate in the United States
                     Senate, and may be regarded as displaying in its spirit a fair criterion of the
                     proprieties and doings of both branches of Congress as conducted at that
                     time.
                  
                     We, members of the House, in common with the people, often availed
                     ourselves of the privilege extended—the opportunity of listening to the sage
                     speech of reverend Senators. On one occasion, regarded as of unusual interest,
                     I sat as one of the "sovereign people" in the Senate gallery, listening
                     attentively to a debate similar to the following:—
                  A Senator remarks:—"The Senate is met in body, and is deliberating in body in
                     order, first, to create Thought and purpose on which the Popular Will may
                     expend its energies; and after, to aid in legalizing its demands and to temper
                     the lawful expression of those demands with the wisdom and justice inhering in
                     this deliberative assembly for such intent. This duty from the Senate is always
                     the rational demand of the country. Shall we, as in the bill now
                     before us, allow the Popular Will to originate measures in its own brain? Shall
                     we allow it to establish so exorbitant a precedent with so exorbitant a
                     measure? The Popular Demand, when originating with the people, is almost
                     invariably unwarrantable and exorbitant; seldom to be trusted as likely to be
                     conducive to the good of the country. Shall we then give way, allow it to
                     undermine and prostrate our powers, rule in these halls, and eventually ruin
                     the country? No! no! Mr. President! we are placed here to guide Popular Will
                     and not to be guided by it. We should rise above all that nonsense about being
                     "the servants of the people," and claim and maintain our position as the Leaders that we ought to be. We cannot inspire and secure respect
                     to ourselves and to the dignity of the Government, otherwise. Senators have now
                     before them an alarming example of the folly into which the mind of the people
                     may fall, in this bill for the purchase of Great Britain which has been
                     introduced by the honorable Senator from El Dorado. Does the honorable Senator
                     really regard this measure as either just or expedient? His little speech
                     accompanying its introduction failed to enlighten Senators; and it has also
                     been launched on the Senate without a premonition of any kind from its friends.
                     Does he suppose that the popular call and the introduction of the bill in this
                     unexpected manner are to ensure the passage of so monstrous a measure? Let him
                     explain what the thing means! I do not anticipate he will betray any personal
                     and party ends that are to be served, but let him inform us, if possible, what
                     is desired otherwise. He need not fear to commit himself. There is no danger
                     that Senators or the people will accuse the honorable gentleman of turning a
                     deaf ear to their interests if he
                     state the true object of this most ruinous measure. He has, on other occasions
                     as well as this, declaimed so loudly and so long on the theme—Popular Will—that
                     his most lukewarm friends can never doubt him—so loudly and so long that his
                     words should be stamped and driven in on every square inch of the walls of this
                     room; and always he has failed to speak of his own views—he has never brought
                     his own excellent judgment to bear truthfully on any matter which has
                     interested us. His great, one, terrible cry has always been:—
                  "The people believe this to be for the best—the people believe that to be for
                     the best—the people ask for this—the people ask for that.
                  "Will the gentleman now speak out and inform us what he believes,
                     and what he asks, and why he asks it. We are taking
                     care of the people, not the people of us. There is the truth for Senators,
                     etc., etc., etc."
                  
                     Defendus:—the Senator from El Dorado who has introduced the Great
                     Britain bill, responds, temperately, that:—
                  "The purchase of Great Britain, besides securing to the United States many
                     millions of intelligent, moral, and industrious people, will cleave asunder the
                     colossal coalitions about to be cemented and perfected by the crowned heads of
                     Europe for the purpose of brow-beating and overpowering Republicanism, the only
                     form of government that can save the world from eventual anarchy. What a
                     momentous question! 'Millions for defence; not one cent for tribute,' says the
                     one, great, unanimous voice of the people."
                  
                     Ironsides of Penna., the Senator first introduced,
                     interrupts:—
                  "The honorable Senator from El Dorado has the floor; will he allow a word?"
                  
                     Defendus:—"Proceed, sir!"
                  
                     Ironsides:—"The honorable gentleman is aware that the carrying
                     out the provisions of his bill will require a vast amount of means, more than
                     enough to exhaust utterly the entire resources of the country, private as well
                     as public, both individual and national; it will tax agriculture, manufactures,
                     and commerce to more than the last mill of their value; then why foolishly
                     advocate the adoption of a measure, the means for operating the provisions of
                     which are so entirely inadequate? Why strive to embark the nation in an
                     undertaking which will so certainly involve and prostrate it beyond all
                     possibility of recuperation, even in the remotest future! Why so wildly and
                     wickedly strive to legislate us into absolute nothingness?"
                  
                     Defendus continues:—"The debt created by the purchase of Great
                     Britain will not necessarily amount to a much greater sum than the present
                     national debt of that kingdom, which she carries so easily and lightly; and
                     that is a short-sighted common-sense which has not already perceived that after
                     the purchase there will be double the people and quadruple the wealth with
                     which to lift the burden; we not only become masters of the vast commerce and
                     manufacturing powers of the kingdom itself, but also masters of the energies of
                     British America and Australia, and of the wealth of Australia and
                     Hindostan."
                  In the mean time there is another bill of engrossing interest on the tapis.
                  There has been much talk and a great deal of interest manifested latterly in
                     private circles concerning balloon voyages to the moon. A bill with this object
                     in view has been prepared by prominent Senators and is now on the calendar.
                     This bill has been warmly discussed by Senators in caucus and now has the
                     serious, ardent sympathy of many to the detriment of the Great Britain
                     bill.
                  The discussion of the Great Britain bill grates harshly on the nerves of these
                     Senators. This is well understood; therefore as soon as Defendus
                     resumes his seat and the way is opened, one of their number jumps up and moves
                     the postponement of the bill under discussion to some future day. The motion is
                     instantly seconded and prevails almost by acclamation; the friends of the
                     Balloon bill are so numerous and know so well that the passage of either bill
                     involves the serious question of national credit, and that therefore there is
                     not a possibility that more than one shall live.
                  Directly, the Balloon bill comes before the Senate, receiving the most
                     enthusiastic attention at its first introduction.
                  
                     Mr. Fargone is speaking:—
                  "I have just returned from a trip to the moon and can pronounce that I have
                     found it a world gorgeous and beautiful beyond compare. Golden slopes and sunny
                     intervales are clad with a verdure and a blossoming outvieing in brightness, richness, and all refined
                     attractions and splendors any that could have been dreamed of by the
                     imaginative and voluptuous Spaniards who listened with chained attention to the
                     tales told of the Indies by the followers of the dreamy Columbus. Choice,
                     luscious fruits, exceeding in rareness and deliciousness the ambrosial
                     nectar—food for gods—are lavished by the wealthy and generous hand of Nature in
                     wanton profusion. The intoxicating aroma of honey-ladened blossom and of
                     perpetually ripening fruits, purple and golden, is almost overpowering to
                     mortal senses. Hesperidean profusion and magnificence are surpassed by the
                     teeming, bountiful gardens and enchanting vales of fair Luna. No cold, barren
                     places there. All is gold and emerald; and light and life; and joy and
                     sunshine. Clad in garments which shine as with the luster of Heaven, the
                     budding girls and blooming women wear an aspect fairer and sweeter than the
                     houris of Mahomet's Paradise. And the men walk princely, with the glory and the
                     powers of Uriel and of Raphael stamped and glowing on their brows."
                  And much more was added in the same high wrought strain.
                  I watched from my place in the gallery and comprehended that sage, reverend
                     Senators were becoming fired with the description. Their blood had commenced to
                     pulse as in the newness, and with the life of youth. Their imaginations called
                     in all the marvels wrought by Geni, Magician, and ancient Chemist. What if air,
                     or food, or water of the Moon, should prove to be the alembic holding the
                     Elixir, so long and so vainly sought, that is to bequeath endless days of
                     youth! Would not a country seat in the Moon be indeed a priceless treasure?
                  I saw that it needed but a justification bearing the semblance of wisdom, to
                     carry the Balloon bill.
                  That soon came from Senator Bunkum of Occidentalia, condensed in
                     brief, as follows:—
                  "The day, Mr. President, that first beholds the inaugration of a line of
                     Balloons from the Earth to the Moon will be hailed, universally, with
                     profoundest pleasure, as an era marking the stupendous progress of Science. I
                     care not so much for the sensual pleasures so finely described by the
                     imaginative gentleman who has enjoyed the pleasure of a visit to our satellite.
                     I desire more to call attention to the intellectual values that may be
                     obtained—to the material interests and physical features of the planet which we
                     inhabit, that are affected—to those interests which we may so materially affect
                     by reason of establishing continuous communication with the moon—by reason of
                     getting control and conduct of the movements which shall hereafter transpire on
                     her surface. Who shall say to what extent puny man may hereafter be enabled to
                     regulate the falling of rains and dews, and hence the preservation or
                     demolition of hills and mountains, of the volume and flow of springs,
                     brooklets, and rivers, in the long ages to come; how much be enabled to control
                     the rise and fall of the tides—the running of ocean currents—the equability of
                     trade winds—the raging of typhoons and cyclones—and many other of the
                     innumerable Phenomena in Nature which are so seriously affected by the inherent
                     potencies wielded by the Lesser Luminary—all involving the destruction or the
                     preservation of thousands and thousands of miles of shifting coast lines; of
                     the harbors, of the towns and great cities which these coast lines protect or
                     sustain, the one in active growth, the other in their natural state of
                     perfection and usefulness; of the engulphing in angry waters of islands, of
                     great promontories as well as little bits of earth, of the building up of new
                     lands and new kingdoms in the wild waste of waters where now 'soil, and
                     greenness, and bloom' know not their abiding place—etc., etc., etc., ad infinitum. Heavens! what thoughts! Can it be
                     said, when we reflect how much man may yet become master of the powers which
                     are constantly working out the marvels of Nature, that He doth,
                     really, 'Hold the winds in the hollow of His Almighty Hand'?"
                  "Ah!" I mentally ejaculated in my seat in the gallery, "what a great thing is
                     this far-reaching, audacious Pride of Progress, harnessed in alliance with the
                     Greed, or the Love of Self, with which to rule the nineteenth century."
                  The Balloon bill passed. Comments are needless.
                  We defeated it in the House, but only for the reason that the Senate had
                     trespassed on one of our constitutional prerogatives in originating and
                     adopting a measure which appropriated the revenue necessary to make its
                     provisions operative.
                  I anticipate the House will reframe the bill and pass it at some future
                     day.
                  
                  I remained in Congress but two years and would not of course, suffer a
                     re-election. I am now therefore an X. M. C.
                  Subsequent to my years of foreign travel I have remained in the United States;
                     traveling considerably; have cultivated acquaintance with all classes and
                     phases of society, endeavoring, in my way, to enjoy myself and render happiness
                     to others; doing when in Boston as the Bostonians do, and when in Philadelphia
                     agreeing with the Philadelphians, though by no means allowing my individuality
                     to become merged in theirs. If the society of those, and other cities, is not
                     conducted on the best of principles I do not regard it as a fault of mine, or
                     that I should withhold myself a recluse from intercourse with them, or with any
                     of my kind, fearful of soiling my soul.
                  So, I have dallied with pleasure in the sumptuously decorated halls of New
                     York, where fashion and folly hold high court, and immediately thereafter have
                     been received as a welcome guest in city parlors where the Genius of Science
                     and Literature presides. Again:—grasping the friendly hands of the rougher sons
                     and daughters of toil, to be immediately succeeded with exchanging the
                     courtesies and amenities of life with the high and thorough-bred favorites of
                     the best schools of Culture.
                  Said an honest, matronly farmer's wife to me one day:—
                  "Nelson, I'm afraid if you visit so much in the great cities where folly and
                     vice are so frequent, you'll get corrupted, and depart from the sure, safe,
                     good old ways and beliefs of your fathers and mothers."
                  No, I hope not; and as I said to her in reply:—
                  "Prudence Johnson, I hope to abide by the good, serene old faith; but
                     Providence has not implanted within our active minds the desire for knowledge
                     but for some wise purpose; therefore, hoping that my strength of character is
                     sufficient to maintain me in integrity I seek all and mingle with all in search
                     of its blessings, and reject none who approach, so long as the approach be made
                     with decency and respect to themselves and to me. I do not consider it a
                     misfortune to a person to have been born, and to dwell in a city, if that
                     person be but virtuous and respectable. Even, if the heart be right, I count it
                     as of little consequence that he or she be consigned to some particular grade
                     in society. In fact, dear madam, I do conscientiously think that country bred
                     people should be a little less rigorous in their judgment of their city
                     brethern and sisters, and concede, if their merit warrant, that they may enter
                     within the pale of country social communion as respected and loved as any. The
                     city bred individual, so long as he or she behaves himself or herself, is as
                     worthy of esteem and confidence as the country bred, and should be treated
                     accordingly."
                  Mrs. Johnson acknowledged that the theory of my argument was beautiful, but did
                     not forget to remind me of the possible consequences, if children will play
                     with edge tools, or if the poor moth will persist in fluttering
                     around the brilliant flame.
                  Dear, good, blessed old soul! How I do love her! But all she has ever done, is
                     to stay at home and read her Bible and the newspapers. She would regard it as a
                     sacrilege to her religion—as a sin never to be forgiven of Heaven if she should
                     but once step within the precincts presided over by that Society in New York
                     which dictates the fashions and social laws to the feminity of the United
                     States, unless she entered there upon an errand of mercy. Which is right,—she
                     or I, I wonder? Both, perhaps.
                  I have now, together with what is contained in the previous chapters, given an
                     outline delineation of the more prominent incidents in the history of my life
                     up to the time when I visited the deserted mountain home of Eureka Dare.
                  The succeeding chapter completes the narrative, acquainting the interested
                     reader with the manner in which I next met the girl of my choice, together with
                     other matters of importance.
               
               
                  V.
                  IT. THE DENOUEMENT.
                  MR. BASCOM'S NARRATIVE—Completed.
                  As related at the close of the third chapter I advertised for two years,
                     receiving nothing in return concerning the precious child I now so much desired
                     to find but a silence as profound as that which dwells in Saharan
                     solitudes.
                  
                  Before the two years of advertising were quite expired two young farmers
                     residing in my native town, and friends of mine, were about proceeding to view
                     the rich lands of the West with the intention to secure some desirable
                     situation whereon they might permanently locate their homes.
                  Having had much valuable experience in agricultural matters, and being regarded
                     as a pretty good judge of soils and of their various degrees of capability to
                     produce, and moreover being a man of any amount of leisure, as they well knew,
                     my friends proposed that I should accompany them in their tour. Although I had,
                     during the time of advertising, employed my time with traveling in the region
                     of country west of the Lakes, I was still as anxious to continue the search for
                     Eureka as at any former time. Having now, therefore, attended to the important
                     business matters which had compelled my return to the East for a brief time, I
                     signified an eager willingness to accompany my friends in the capacity of
                     friend and adviser.
                  I had begun to feel that it was becoming necessary to my happiness to get some
                     reliable clue to the dear girl's whereabouts. Fond and approving remembrances
                     of her many mental and moral excellences and accomplishments, her beauties, her
                     many engaging ways, her perfection and sweetness in every sense, had been busy
                     with my heart weaving themselves inextricably and ineradicably in with its most
                     living fibers. I experienced at last that I must discover the young Eureka, to
                     have and to hold, or I should never again know a moment's contentment.
                  We therefore, soon after my friends had acquainted me with their desires, set
                     out, and were speedily drawn by the powerful steam horse of the newly invented
                     parallels to the metropolis of the great lakes—Chicago. Thence we had planned a
                     circuit through the important prairie States of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri;
                     my friends to return to the East via St.
                     Louis and Cincinnati to get their wives and proceed again to the lands they
                     doubted not they should have selected and purchased; and I—well, no matter! I
                     had as yet kept my own counsel concerning the object of my solicitude, and
                     hoped I might not continue with them so far as St. Louis, where I designed, if
                     still in their company, to bid them adieu at all events.
                  Pursuing our design when we had arrived in Chicago, we proceeded leisurely,
                     viewing the country critically as we had contemplated, up the beautiful and
                     rich Rock River valley then through the State of Wisconsin, and after a time
                     arrived in the State of Iowa.
                  We were passing through Iowa on the borders of settlement and civilization, and
                     had arrived nearly at its southern boundary, when one day I listened to a story
                     of adventure related among a company of hardy pioneers which thrilled to the
                     life of my system, causing me to experience an intense, thrilling, and very
                     pleasurable anxiety.
                  The story, or marvel rather, related by the rough and honest borderer, I will
                     give in my own language, though I shall not do it the same justice
                     that it received in the terse, picturesque, and spicy, but corrupt dialect of
                     that, then, frontier.
                  Some two hundred miles away—stories of as much interest as the one in question
                     travel fast and far in newly settled regions, often spreading nearly as rapidly
                     as did the California gold excitement—in the same advancing line of
                     civilization in which we were now traveling, in the vicinity of the Ozark
                     Hills, a young girl of sixteen, alone and unaided, with no weapons but the good
                     arms which Nature gave her, and a chance club caught from the ground, had met
                     the ferocious attacking American panther—most dreaded of all the beasts of the
                     American wilderness—she had met and had conquered the strong, supple, vicious
                     brute after a short decisive struggle.
                  I shall always remember the manner in which the hardy sons of the prairie wilds
                     received this story; the swelling and surging chest; the eye dilating under a
                     peculiar contraction of the lids; the drawing the person up into erect majesty
                     in sympathy with eloquent conceptions of bravery; the brief and strong
                     ejaculations called forth by a vivid and profound admiration—short, pithy
                     exclamations of eulogy; and, my friend, when the Pioneer of the Western Plains,
                     he who unflinchingly meets and conquers the "Indian's Devil," as some
                     story-writer has very appropriately named the panther—who fights the bear face
                     to face, and the wolf in droves; when the stern, rough, and unlettered man does
                     all this, as he surely does, awards you the meed of praise for personal
                     physical courage, you may be sure it is meant and merited.
                  
                  And, be sure, the life which is continually trying and putting valor to the
                     severest of tests, imparts a knowledge—the quality of mind, to the man who
                     lives it, which instructs him to discriminate, to value with the nicest
                     accuracy, and to give esteem to none but those who are emulous of courage. And
                     if you ever get that approbation you will cherish it in your memory.
                  In relating the story the eloquent narrator had spoken of the young girl as
                        "Found It." "Found It" had struck with her club in
                        this manner as the ugly panther sprang toward her, and then had
                     sprung aside, so—accompanying his graphic language with sweeping
                     and almost speaking emphasis of action—and then with the swiftness of
                     lightning, and before the recovery of the animal from the effects of the first
                     severe crashing stroke, had dealt a second and then a third powerful blow,
                     finishing the coup de main by annihilating
                     her antagonist.
                  Every circumstance was given in minute and vivid detail.
                  The man whose wits are always necessarily in employ in self-defense—who is
                     half-hunter, half-farmer, and all hero, never suffers any, the least particular
                     of such an exciting, thrilling adventure to escape his keen mental vision; what
                     though he be not trained in the schools to think with the precision and
                     elegance of the book-men.
                  I needed no surer guaranty of the story's truth than I could discover in the
                     relater's deep, entirely absorbed engrossment, and the intense interest
                     evidenced in the ejaculations and speaking actions of his auditory. The
                     occasion is rare when the frontiersman suffers himself to be imposed upon, or
                     endeavors to impose upon others in matters of personal prowess. It is his pride
                     to maintain honesty in this, the always hardest bought, and therefore dearest
                     glory of his station.
                  "Found It!" "Found It!"*
                      Yes! singular, strange as it seemed, it must be true. Western Border
                     Life had learned the interpretation to her name; and Western Character, with
                     its fondness for abbreviations, synonyms, "nick-names," and giving titles and
                     appellatives distinguishing character, deeds of stirring adventure, and other
                     prominent features of personality, had, Indian-like, and oddly enough,
                     rechristened the little Pennsylvania mountain girl of my entranced "vision" of
                     six years before—"Found It."
                  
                     
                     *The reader will discover in this term, "Found It," so
                        singularly used as a personal name, the explanation volunteered at the
                        close of the third chapter. The rough borderers were probably
                        unacquainted with the significance of its Greek synonym, and did not know
                        that that synonym was her real name. She was known to them only as "Found
                        It" Smith, the last name that of her protector; hence, Eureka Dare being
                        the person advertised as wanted, they had not an inkling of whom it could
                        mean. Old Dr. Jansen, subsequently introduced, came pretty near to
                        cheating me of my wife when he fell in with western customs and was so
                        kind as to translate her name into English at her first entrance into the
                        State. He seldom troubled himself with advertisements, unless of a
                        medical character.
                  
                  Without acquainting my friends with my belief concerning the identity of the
                     heroine of the panther story with any one of my acquaintance, I led the way,
                     after we had swum the Missouri River, to the region where this superlative for
                     courage, "Found It," dwelt. While prosecuting the journey from Iowa toward the
                     Ozarks, I heard the adventure alluded to very often; the circumstances always
                     the same, substantially; and as we neared the scene of the rencontre the minute
                     descriptions of the personal appearance of the fair heroine coincided so
                     entirely with my own imaginings of what Eureka Dare ought to be at sixteen,
                     that my hopes became increasingly, and finally confidently sure that she and
                     this brave young "Found It" were identical in person.
                  I became supremely confident that I was approaching the days of my bliss very
                     closely—very closely. What man is there, however hard, and stern, and cold he
                     may appear on the surface, who has not indulged at some time during his life,
                     his soft, and tender, and royal dream of woman? If there be any who has not, I
                     pity him—everybody may pity him.
                  We had arrived in that part of Missouri near the Ozarks where the country
                     assumes the appearance of an exceeding heavy swelling, or rolling prairie; or
                     presents rather a succession of hills to the view of the traveler. The time was
                     late evening.
                  For convenience of man and horse our camp fire had been kindled on a strip of
                     level forest land bordering on a running stream. The fire was kindled, not in
                     the wood, but near its edge. We camped near the timber for the facilities of
                     fuel and water afforded, and in the "open" because we were in a wild, strange
                     country and preferred to be where we could look about us.
                  And we thus camped out, not because we waived Western hospitality
                     as inimical, far from it, but the cabins of the pioneers were small; my friends were just
                     starting in life, had their fortunes to make, and were therefore naturally
                     desirous of saving their "dimes;" and I—well I had roasted too many ears of
                     corn by the blazing brush and log fires, during my boyish days, while keeping
                     secure through the night the treed raccoon—"coons" by the way didn't come down
                     from the high tree tops to my call as accommodatingly as they had done
                     aforetime to the call of Davy Crockett, or to some one of his
                     compatriots, Capt. Martin Scott, I guess—not to now relish a
                     night bivouac by a Western fire in the open air.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *I had also tasted of the delights and healthfulness of a bed on the hard
                        dry earth too many times while in California to not desire repetitions of
                        the pleasure on the present tour.
                  
                  We had passed a pleasant evening, reviewing the capabilities of the different
                     sections of splendid prairie country we had passed over since leaving Chicago,
                     and were now, my friends at least, contentedly preparing their places of rest
                     by the fire for the night. I, my thoughts very busy, had not contemplated lying
                     down for some time yet. On the morrow I anticipated meeting with the girl who
                     was becoming as a dream of happiness to me. I should have been with her now—so
                     near as I was, according to responses given in answer to my cautious
                     inquiries—only, that, I was not quite sure, and also did not wish to excite the
                     curiosity and attention of my friends.
                  There is no young man of real refinement and delicacy of feeling but what is
                     chary and coy of his first love as is the shy maiden in her teens of
                        her first delicious hope. There is many and many such a young
                     man who regards it as a more sacred thing than he does his God. God bless him!
                     for he deserves it; and there is no danger but God and his Love
                     will resume their proper relative positions in his mind when reason resumes her
                     sway, as she is sure to do.
                  It was this sacred feeling—the feeling that bids the man refrain from imparting
                     his love confidences to any but the girl of his choice that had prevented my
                     communicating my discovery to my friends, bidding them good-night, and
                     proceeding the remaining few miles lying between me and my love, before
                     camping.
                  During the evening the short-legged wolves had kept up their incessant, short,
                     sharp bark, and peculiar whining howl, in answer to one another, on all sides
                     surrounding our camp-fire. But this did not particularly disturb us; we having
                     become so accustomed to the bark of the wolf as to regard it as indispensable
                     to the enjoyment of night-life on the prairie. As yet there had nothing
                     transpired to denote that there was any unusual stir in wolf-life; nor did we
                     anticipate anything extraordinary.
                  Jordan, one of my friends, had stretched himself out at length and closed his
                     eyes preparatory to welcoming the embraces of Morpheus; perhaps it might be as
                     well to use the plain English word, and say, sleep; but that some
                     readers are in favor with picturesque similes, disinterred from the mythical,
                     shadowy realms of the past. I suppose, yes, I have no doubt, that such things
                     minister, when rightly employed, to the growth of some particular useful
                     faculty and beauty of the mind.
                  McAllister, the other friend, had just returned from taking a last look for the
                     night, at our horses which were picketed just without the circle of the ruddy
                     glow cast around by our fire, and was now, while preparing his couch,
                     frequently pausing in his occupation to peer curiously along the line of gloom
                     cast by the timber out on the prairie, we being on that side not illumined by
                     the moon.
                  McAllister at last paused from his bed-making and peered a long time along the
                     line of gloom up the stretch of timber. Jordan was almost dozing. At length
                     McAllister became so interested that he spoke:—
                  "Bascom, there's something the matter with the hungry devils away off up yonder
                     in the dark."
                  The sound of McAllister's voice, a little different from its ordinary
                     conversational tone, roused up Jordan who was just reaching that state of
                     dreamy, lethargic, half-quiescent repose, from the enjoyment of which a man
                     dislikes being disturbed. He raised himself on his elbow, half surlily
                     exclaiming as he did so:—
                  "Blast the varmint Mc.; you never mind them, but just lie down
                     and go to sleep; they are quite likely running down a deer, and what's that to
                     us I'd like to know?"
                  McAllister returned good humoredly:—
                  "It's considerable to me Jordy; always when there's fun agoing on I want a hand
                     in."
                  Jordan completely regaining his senses as McAllister replied, now laughingly
                     responded:—
                  
                  "Well! well! Mc., if you want to 'tackle' a thousand wolves single-handed, go
                     and pitch in, but leave me to my 'snooze' in quiet," and he sank back easily on
                     the golden grass.
                  For some four or five minutes previous to my seeing McAllister searching with
                     his eyes along the gloom of the wood I thought I had distinguished the yelping
                     of the wolves in that direction as more eager and excited than is usual in
                     their ordinary cry, and that they were evidently concentrating their numbers at
                     some point not more than a mile or so away. Their wild, alarming cry becoming
                     increasingly vociferous, and the tumult increasing rapidly among them, I was
                     now quite sure, and as Jordan resumed his recumbent position on the autumn
                     grass, I replied to McAllister's first exclamation:—
                  "Yes, McAllister, the ugly beasts are making mischief with something; that's
                     sure."
                  We listened in silence for two or three minutes longer. Jordan was again
                     sinking into a doze. The tumult among the wolves still increased; and they were
                     approaching us rapidly.
                  McAllister and I had looked to our pistols; had seized our heavy riding whips,
                     manufactured to order and loaded at the butt with lead. Jordan was dozing.
                  We were about marching with a tacit understanding to stand by our horses or
                     bring them in, when—there came ringing and winging its way swiftly over the
                     prairie to our expectant, listening ears, the call of a girlish voice; clear,
                     almost laughing, and with a sweeter, more awakening music in its tone than had
                     that other voice—to which I instantly discovered this was kin—which I first
                     heard command "Eureka" away back in Pennsylvania six years ago;
                     this voice which must be in such imminent peril, called clearly and almost
                     playfully, as though its owner were enjoying pastime with the fast congregating
                     wolves as do little girls with kittens—this voice called:—
                  "Help!" Once; that was all; no repetition.
                  I recognized the familiar, dear intonation, and the extreme peril of her who
                     had spoken, at once, and as I sprang toward the drove of tearing wolves which
                     had become visible in the moonlight just outside the line of shadow, and not
                     more than forty rods from us, I shouted out a great agony:—
                  "My God! McAllister, quick! It is an old and very dear friend of mine."
                  Then I would have proclaimed my beautiful, my rare, my sacred Love
                     to the Universe, if so be I had thought the disclosure would save its object
                     from harm.
                  McAllister answered my summons and was by my side in an instant, and together
                     we were bracing swiftly and surely for the pack. Jordan, who had sprung to his
                     feet instantly at the sound of the clear, ringing voice that had called so
                     melodiously, even in the extremity of a great danger, was barely three paces
                     behind us.
                  Thus we three rushed ahead to meet the swiftly shifting, savage pack. The pack
                     was also approaching us with great speed.
                  When the wolves first became visible, emerging from the shadow of the forest, I
                     distinguished a slight female form in advance, fleeing toward us as if on the
                     wings of the swift wind. I knew whose form that was. O! how well!
                  As I ran, old memory of the precious child whose life I had saved on the
                     Alleghany mountain side, flooded my soul with its inspiring hopes, speeding an
                     electric fire through my system that was felt to remotest nerve, muscle, and
                     sinew. Answering to its driving impulsion I felt superhuman as I leaped along
                     toward her, gaining a pace of McAllister who was anything but a laggard on his
                     feet.
                  We had gained to within fifteen rods of meeting when the little fiends began to
                     close in around her. I saw them. Ten rods distant, and she was in the midst of
                     the moving, swirling, raging cyclone of wolves—wolves unmerciful, relentless as
                     death. I shuddered, repeating fearfully to myself:—
                  "Oh God! is there no chance for Eureka?"
                  Yes, help! there must be, we are so close, unless she despair; and
                     despair she did not. The slight, girlish form carried itself like a veteran
                     warrior without weapons when beset by a multitude. No yielding. She acted on
                     the defensive. She retreated backwards; one side to us; then the other; she
                     retreated in all manner of ways.
                  Now some of the bolder and more hardy of the pack began to spring upon her to
                     tear her down; seeming to become more fierce and determined the nearer succor
                     approached and they were likely to lose their prey. A wolf sprang swift and sure; a light agile bound aside
                     placed her out of his reach as he flew past in the air; another, two at once,
                     one she dodged, received the other with her ready hands and dashed him howling
                     into the pack; three came, snarling and ferocious; with either hand she
                     received one and with them buffeted the third.
                  "By my blessed young wife; but she's worth it," panted McAllister almost in my
                     ear.
                  I said nothing: even in running my teeth were hard set. Didn't I know what she
                     was worth?
                  Three seconds more and half-a-dozen were springing upon her; another three
                     seconds and she would be borne down, torn and mangled by twenty. I did not pray
                     now. I said to myself, while a deadly fear began to creep into my heart:—
                  "God has forsaken my love. She is lost."
                  But no, making one superhuman leap, clearing full twelve feet over the backs of
                     half-a-dozen wolves, dashing three or four to the earth with the impetus
                     acquired by her body as it described the curve, she was again free.
                  That tremendous spring saved her from the fangs of the little monsters. Five
                     seconds more, and there were three strong men close around her. Two of us tore
                     from her person, on which they were just surely fastening, five more of the
                     savages; and then, without waiting to draw our pistols—I think we all
                     comprehended the most effective mode of warfare when we first started to the
                     rescue—we began to rain blows thickly about us with the butts of our heavy
                     riding whips. In five minutes time a score of wolves with broken skulls
                     encumbered the prairie, while the remainder were fleeing, yelping and howling
                     to their earthy kennels.
                  I sang a hosanna in my interior consciousness.
                  Eureka was saved.
                  Unharmed, without a scratch, she stood on the Missouri prairie in the slanting,
                     glancing rays of the beautiful filling Autumn moon, fearless as of old, and
                     free.
                  Silence reigned for a few seconds after the dispersion of the wolves, during
                     which time I eagerly contemplated the royal beauty that the person of the
                     well-remembered little girl of ten had gathered to itself in six years. As I
                     noted the aspect of countenance, lofty with fearless innocence, intelligence
                     and truth; the complexion perfectly clear and pure, indicating the blood as
                     healthy, untainted; the form, though slight, yet betokening serene vigor as
                     well as admirable litheness; traced the sinews of fore arm and ankle, which
                     showed themselves through the white skin tenacious as the toughest wire;
                     fathomed the eye, which was quick and strong as the eagle's, yet sweetly
                     softened with a blending of the tenderness of the dove's; and remembered the
                     unrivalled courage she had evinced in the old encounter with the snake and that
                     which she had just displayed in the recent combat with the wolves, I knew that
                     Eureka Dare was the girl to have met and conquered the terrible American
                     Panther.
                  It is probable that we were all too profoundly impressed with a feeling sense
                     of the danger which had menaced the radiant being who now stood quietly and
                     modestly before us, to have spoken immediately. I, absorbedly contemplating the
                     almost perfect physical beauty, as well as gathering an inner sense of the
                     spiritual, which I have remarked, did not feel disposed to relinquish my
                     agreeable emotions by disturbing the quiet.
                  Eureka was the first to break the silence. Advancing to where I was standing,
                     wrapped in my thoughts almost as in a rapt trance, while a sweet, serious
                     gravity rested in her face, and there was that old precious look of gratitude
                     and love still dwelling and resting expectantly in her eyes as it had beamed
                     from them at our first meeting six years ago, she placed her hand in mine
                     saying:—
                  "I believed you would come."
                  This, I intuitively perceived, was spoken with reference to my now being in the
                     vicinity of her new home and not with regard to her rescue from the wolves. It
                     was spoken still as from the pure mind of a child; simple, artless; therefore,
                     while I reflected a joyful thanksgiving, feeling her thoughts as sacred to
                     myself alone, and not desiring to give my companions a clue to her meaning, I
                     replied as though she had spoken with reference to her peril:—
                  "Yes, we were just in time. I dread contemplating what might have been had we
                     been ten seconds later. Why are you out alone on the prairie at so late an
                     hour? Were you not aware of the danger?"
                  By that peculiar intuition inborn in most female natures, she sought and found
                     my answer to her confidence in my
                     manner, was satisfied, and replied, the glory of a full faith illumining her
                     countenance and speaking in her tone of voice and manner to me:—
                  "Yes, Mr. Bascom, there was danger, but I had not apprehended it, having chased
                     those little fellows to their holes in the ground a hundred times by daylight;
                     but had I known, I should have come nevertheless. I am going for the doctor.
                     The kind old friend who befriended me after father's death was taken very ill
                     this morning with the fever. I have come twelve miles since sunset and have yet
                     three more to go. And," continued she, with utterance increasing rapidly, fear
                     for her old friend returning and increasing as she thought of her
                     detention:—"please Mr. Bascom and gentlemen, don't detain me longer; I fear Mr.
                     Smith may be in great need of the doctor's services."
                  Saying which she was about leaving us, but I interposed:—
                  "No! no! Miss Dare! Please wait a little. I am going with you to summon the
                     doctor. I have a horse near by which will carry us there much more speedily
                     than you can walk the distance. You have not forgotten our old horseback rides
                     among the Pennsylvania mountains so long ago?"
                  "O no, sir!" she said eagerly, "I have not forgotten. Their renewal on the
                     Missouri prairie will afford me much pleasure."
                  Then, her voice and manner changing in answer to a sudden thought, she looked
                     archly into my face, and added:—
                  "But what if I should run, instead of walk?"—
                  "Then I fear so active a girl might distance me; particularly as I have my
                     horse to bridle and saddle; but you'll wait, won't you?"
                  "Yes. I will wait, gladly wait."
                  She spoke unaffectedly and from the heart; entirely regardless of,
                     unembarrassed by, the presence of McAllister and Jordan who were standing
                     attentive listeners. She knew no more concerning the conventions of society
                     than does little Miss Pert of the black bear. Little had her
                     schooling in Pennsylvania effected to warp the natural, pure instincts of the
                     heart. And yet, I think, had she suspected she might be betraying woman's
                     sweetest thought to rude scrutiny, her soul would have closed its approaches as
                     instantly and as securely as does that sensitive sea-plant which folds its
                     leaves so suddenly over its delicate petals when rudely assailed.
                  I replied to the last welcome response:—
                  "Well, that is settled; but I must not forget to present to you my friends who
                     rendered me such efficient assistance a short time since."
                  I gave her their names.
                  "I am happy to make the acquaintance of Mr. Bascom's friends, gentlemen, and am
                     not unmindful of the prompt assistance which you have given me to-night."
                  McAllister and Jordan responded in proper spirit, when Eureka, her anxiety for
                     Mr. Smith's welfare increasing in proportion as the encounter with the wolves
                     and her recent happy meeting with me receded farther in the distance, turning
                     to me, continued:—
                  "Please, Mr. Bascom, let us be speedy; when I left Mr. Smith, at the
                     commencement of the evening, his fever was increasing very rapidly."
                  I proceeded at once to caparison my horse for the night ride, desiring Eureka,
                     meanwhile, to inform my friends of the route to Mr. Smith's, that they might
                     visit me there on the morrow.
                  We were soon mounted and on the way to the doctor's. My horse, being one of
                     those trained to bound forward in an easy, rocking gallop, we had little
                     difficulty in conversing on the way, Eureka informing me of important events in
                     her past life since our first and last parting.
                  I received from her, perceiving that she was greatly moved during the recital,
                     a thrilling description of her father's last hours on earth; learning that she
                     alone was the faithful watcher at his dying bedside. And when I learned the
                     fearful endurance she had undergone during that trying night of horrors; alone
                     endeavoring to soothe his terrible ravings—his frenzy—his madness—her life
                     threatened at every moment—in fact, a young girl of only twelve years alone
                     coping with all the awful horrors which delirium tremens visits on the last
                     hours of a strong man, I mentally vowed that all who were within the guild of
                     Authorship, and that all who ministered to the parasities of the Press, should
                     never receive, henceforth, countenance from me; rather I would visit them with scorn and
                        hate;*
                      they having been, willfully, the ruin of a noble man, and the father
                     and protector of one of God's noblest children at a time when she most needed
                     his tenderest care—the ruin of the father of the dear girl whom I was beginning
                     to love with all the strength of my life.
                  
                     
                     *It is very evident that Mr. Bascom allowed sympathy for his father-in-law
                        to warp his mind a little with prejudice toward the Craft;
                        authors and publishers are doubtless as respectable a class of people as
                        almost any. N. S. R. B.
                  
                  I thought to myself, the art of Faust was indeed rightly named:—"The black art."
                  The Mr. Smith with whom Eureka was staying I learned from her was now an old
                     man of sixty-five. His home at the time of Broderick Dare's death was on
                     another part of the mountain about five miles from the drunkard's hut. He and
                     his wife had frequently visited her father, drawn toward him I suppose from
                     some similarity of idiosyncracies, and had, on all occasions of meeting evinced
                     much interest and kindness for the daughter.
                  After her father's decease they had kindly desired Eureka to make her home with
                     them. They being the only real friends she had at that time in the
                     neighborhood, she gladly acceded, placing herself in the disinterested care of
                     the kind old couple. She had had some true friends at the school-house in the
                     valley but they and their parents had emigrated to the West, the poor man's
                     paradise. The remainder of the people in the vicinity of the school-house,
                     incapable of comprehending her real worth—her greatness of soul, despised and
                     contemned her as the worthless daughter of a miserable drunkard.
                  Mr. Smith and his wife had reared a large family of children who were then
                     married and dispersed throughout the country. About two years after Eureka had
                     accepted a home with them, and only just previous to my second visit to
                     Pennsylvania, the old couple with an energy characteristic of the inhabitants
                     of the western part of the State, resolved to seek a home and a better fortune
                     than was comprised in a few acres of mountain-side, in the fruitful West. To
                     the West they had therefore come, and finally settled down where they now
                     were.
                  This I learned of Eureka while my horse was galloping with us to the
                     physician's, where we arrived some twenty minutes after leaving the night
                     camping ground.
                  We called the doctor up. He came out into the moonlight where we were awaiting
                     him. Eureka informed him of the urgent need for his skill and services at the
                     house of the old settler. The doctor, whose name was Jansen, assured us that he
                     would soon be on the road, and at once called to his black servant, Jim, to rouse himself from his sleepy lair, and harness the horse;
                     then turning again to me he regarded me intently for a few moments, and as I
                     thought with considerable and peculiar interest, mingled with anxiety, perhaps
                     alarm.
                  At length, whatever might be the subject of his solicitude, he seemed to arrive
                     at the resolution of disburdening his mind, commencing:—
                  "Young man, you are from the East, I judge?"
                  "Yes, sir! all the way from New York."
                  "Well, sir! I like your physiognomy, and besides, your being in such close
                     company with our little prairie white rose, 'Found It,' is a pretty sure
                     guaranty of your honesty and worth, therefore, but without desiring to
                     needlessly alarm you, I will say that I think you are in danger."
                  This unexpected speech raising my curiosity I promptly responded:—
                  "Please explain yourself, doctor. The friend who warns of the approach of
                     danger, should, if possible, communicate its nature."
                  "Yes, yes, I design coming to that in good time. But in the first place let me
                     say as preliminary, that you and that bright young girl leaning against your
                     arm, appear to be very contented and happy in that situation."
                  "Yes, we are happy and satisfied, but I believe that is more particularly
                        our business."
                  "Certainly, certainly," agreed the doctor good humoredly, "I suppose it's all
                     right; but that is the very reason why I apprehend danger for you."
                  "How! What do you mean?"
                  "I mean this:—There is not, with a few unimportant exceptions, a marriageable
                     man, old or young, within fifty miles of this place, who would not spill
                        more than half his blood if he might but enjoy the privilege
                     you are now enjoying so composedly and naturally as it seems."
                  "Ah! doctor, you interest me; pray proceed."
                  "The fact that you, a stranger here, are taking a lone night ride with our
                     little 'Found It,' would, if known
                     hereabouts, cause you trouble; but of that you need have no fear unless you
                     shall chance to meet by the way some youth who keeps late hours, because the
                     knowledge is confined to ourselves; but," said the doctor emphatically, "this
                     is not all. I apprehend quite strongly from appearances—you will understand I
                     am not unread in the language of lovers, and of the world—I apprehend that you
                     design removing our Pride from among us."
                  He placed a singular speaking emphasis on the word, Pride.
                  "Quite true doctor. She herself believes this, though we have not as yet spoken
                     with one another on the subject."
                  "Then permit me to say that the probabilities are almost certain that you will
                     be resisted."
                  "Why doctor!" exclaimed I with the voice of astonishment, "you do not pretend
                     to say that the youth of Missouri will waylay and rob, because they have, in
                     common spirit with all the millions of lovers, coveted?"
                  I remembered his speaking as though half the young men in the State were mad to
                     get to my treasure.
                  "I design to say nothing of the kind. The youth of Missouri are noble and
                     generous as any in the Union. I will explain. I have already used language that
                     has shocked the ears of that simple young girl with you; but it is necessary
                     that she shall yet hear more, and perhaps worse, of that to which she is so
                     unaccustomed. She is simple and pure—has never learned any of our
                     wickednesses, and all the rest—and yet withal, she is possessed of a wisdom
                     more profound than any I have ever discovered in the schools of Europe, and
                     though now in the American wilderness, yet have I studied in some of the best.
                     Her wisdom is a perfect innocence, on which her strong mind has engrafted a
                     goodly amount of that pure, precise knowledge which we all so much covet; and
                     she has obtained it unmixed with a particle of evil. You, yourself, have
                     worshiped this in her with a profounder admiration and respect than any you
                     have ever experienced for her great beauty of person; great! I
                     should say royal, or transcendant, its style being of the divine order, and
                     also peculiarly individual; and that individual beauty, which, like hers, is
                     unique, and distinguishes from the mass, is pretty sure to elicit adoration.
                     Such, in brief, is this brave young girl, 'Found It,' who is, I perceive, fast
                     learning to discover her heaven in you. Do you wonder that such a girl—a girl
                     who has not, probably, her equal in any of the transcendant charms, in the
                     State—one who has not a compeer either in mind or person, so far as I know—do
                     you wonder that all Missouri youth who have made her personal acquaintance, and
                     many who are acquainted with her but by reputation should desire to achieve
                     possession? Do you wonder that her rare attractions have caused the full and
                     complete development of a trait of character that always prevails in growing,
                     thriving, newly settled communities. I do not say we are arrived at the
                        climax here; but should you wonder if this trait of character
                     may become ruling, and forbid the removal of female beauty under
                        any circumstances. Rome, in her young days, unable to live
                     uncheered and unblessed by the smiles of beauty, went out and conquered it of
                     the Sabines. How much more then shall we who are similarly situated here in
                     Missouri, preserve it with us when we have it!"
                  I felt my muscles and sinews growing rigid at thought of what might have been,
                     and might yet be; but that was not perceptible to the doctor, though my Eureka
                     comprehended, pressing my hand, on which hers was lying, hard; still,
                     involuntarily, I think, as I replied:—
                  "I do not wonder. I should wonder were it otherwise. I do wonder she has been
                     mercifully preserved to me so long."
                  "And well you may, young man. 'Found It,' herself, is unaware of the numberless
                     advances she has repelled. I tell you the young men of Missouri have not been
                     idle. But her peculiar wisdom of which I have spoken has been her shield to
                     ward off, as yet, all advances, both honorable and dishonorable; but of the
                     last, God wot! and I know, there have been but very few. Her purity and
                     simplicity and the respect the young men surrounding her have felt for those
                     most ineffable charms has kept them at bay. The matter is simply this:—She has
                     not comprehended a thought of marriage with any of her gallant neighbors and
                     admirers; they have known it; and her shield has so entirely
                     protected her thus far that all have as yet retired abashed as soon as they
                     have reached the threshold of love. But this state of affairs could not and
                     would not have continued much
                     longer. There is many a young man now regarding her with a covetous heart who
                     has the soul of a Lochinvar. You are now, however, here, and are, I think,
                     equal to the situation."
                  "Yes, I believe my life stands between this dear friend and the love of any
                     other man; but what are the particular obstacles I have to encounter?"
                  "You will, I think, be compelled to prove your right to take from among us the
                     most beautiful girl in the State—the girl who is most beautiful in mind as well
                     as person, and who has, unaided by any other, vanquished our most ferocious
                     wild beast—a wild beast which most men dread to encounter alone. Had any young
                     man of the State proposed to marry with this Hebean Pythoness, he would have
                     done so under compulsive proof of his right, unless that right had been clearly
                     established heretofore. You, though not of us, will fare as well as any. Of
                     course, should the girl desire to depart by herself—we being not yet quite
                     Romans should not interfere, and she can do so; but, I see, you
                     are not the man to allow that."
                  "You are right. But please complete your work of generous
                     forethought for my welfare, and inform me in what the proof of my right will
                     consist. I suppose I apprehend, but please be explicit with an explanation. It
                     is always as well to be sure of the ground we are standing on."
                  The doctor smiled a peculiar smile, a little hard and a little amused, as he
                     responded:—
                  "It will probably consist in strength and firmness of sinew and muscle."
                  "Thank you, doctor, I do not particularly desire a personal combat with my
                     countrymen, or one of them, in this cause, particularly as the good will of the
                     lady is already won, and belongs here; but if it must come, why, then, amen!
                     and God defend the right," and my arm tightened close around Eureka. Thereat,
                     how brave and strong her countenance illumined. I knew my arm was around a life
                     good to destroy a dozen of the bravest in the land if need be in my cause; but
                     I mentally resolved that that should never be. I would know that my path was
                     clear of all obstructions before taking Eureka from the shelter of the old man
                     Smith's roof. I would fight the battles alone if they must be fought, and they
                     must be if she could not be removed without.
                  Said the doctor:—
                  "Young man, I believe you are of the right sort, and can heartily wish you
                     success; but of this, be sure; your character for personal prowess must be well
                     established before you can take that girl from among us. Were it some other
                     girl, some one who is not so entirely admirable and so universally admired as
                     is our white rose of the prairies, the case might—understand, I say
                        might, be different; but it is as it is, and I am certain you
                     must abide by what I have said; not because I have said it, but because the
                     truth of my words is ingrained in character as it is developed in this portion
                     of the West."
                  Eureka, who had listened attentively to the colloquy between the doctor and
                     myself, learning much of the hitherto unknown to her, secret springs of action,
                     and fully comprehending the situation and what was proper to be said,
                     impulsively interrupted:—
                  "Doctor! he saved my life to-night!"
                  The doctor's words were short, quick, and eager.
                  "Ah! How is that? Let me hear about it."
                  I narrated the adventure with the wolves. At the conclusion he warmly
                     exclaimed:—
                  "I sincerely congratulate you. I have told you that the Missouri youth are
                     noble and generous and you will learn that it is entirely true. Your path is
                     perfectly clear. You can take 'Found It' from the State without
                     molestation."
                  Now, during all the time that this conversation lasted I had been a little
                     crafty, knowing so well what a satisfaction it is to some people to impart
                     information, hence, with my judicious questions and remarks I had kept the
                     doctor talking, though I had become during the two preceding years as well
                     acquainted with the salient points and prominent traits in Missouri character
                     as he could be, and understood perfectly well the influence that the wolf
                     adventure would exert in my behalf on the minds of Eureka's many admirers.
                     During the conversation I had also learned enough of the doctor to now perceive
                     that if his humor were not crossed he would disseminate my virtues by means of
                     the story of Eureka's rescue, which I preferred, to vaunting my own deeds of
                     fame.
                  And besides, until the close of the conversation I had also thought that,
                     possibly, he might have in view some danger which I had not contemplated; but as the sequel
                     proved, he informed me of little of which I had not already thought. Being
                     careful therefore to now say nothing which should in the future check good old
                     Dr. Jansen in relating the night adventure, the conversation was ended.
                  
                     Jim now driving up with the doctor's horse, he returned into the
                     house, procured his case of medicines, came out again, mounted his gig, and was
                     ready for the night ride to Mr. Smith's.
                  We accordingly set out, the doctor whirling swiftly away in his gig, while
                     Eureka and I followed on my horse, whom I allowed to take the ground at a
                     slower pace.
                  Now that Mr. Smith was likely to get speedy attention I felt a little selfish
                     and wanted my treasure to myself; and she not now urging me forward as at the
                     camp fire, the doctor was soon out of sight.
                  That horseback ride by moonlight on the Western prairie was the pleasantest
                     horseback ride I ever enjoyed. The girl I had so earnestly desired to discover
                     and whom I had begun to cherish in my thoughts as my own life, was leaning in
                     confidence—more than that, was leaning against me as the most coveted of
                     supports. Without a question she accepted my shelter as a refuge of supreme
                     bliss.
                  She was unrestrained, glad and joyous; innocent, intelligent; in the bright
                     morning of life; a beauty lustrous and unsurpassable; and her heart inalienably
                     mine. That I knew. And when I remembered all the fulsomeness, glitter, and
                     tinsel reigning in the world, and so little that is of true worth, why should I
                     not feel exultant?
                  O what a precious, priceless thing is a truthful, true heart, exist where it
                     may, whether in the soul of man or woman! Its price is more than rubies! And
                     yet there is something more costly still! Who shall think the endless value of
                     this truth when it dwells in the heart of the lover.
                     It is almost great as God!
                  I dove in the deep California river and brought up gold; again I had dived in
                     the deeper, dangerous stream of Love, and raised aloft into the blessed light
                     of consciousness, shrined in my glowing soul, a jewel of infinitely rarer value
                     than diamond or costly pearl—that divine jewel, a pure female heart. My friend!
                     did you ever gain access to the inner temple, and there worship
                     and love, its soft, its radiant, its divine, its ineffable
                     splendors? Have you ever enjoyed that superlative happiness?
                  
                  God! God! I was happy that night! Words cannot
                     describe the ecstasies a soul may experience when it enters into the enchanted
                     kingdom ruled by the heart—the ecstasies that I experienced on that time. And
                     happier than I, yea, twice ten thousand times, was Eureka Dare; lying against
                     my breast in all the sweet abandon of perfect innocence and perfect
                     trustfulness.
                  But lovers cannot live alone on sweet thoughts, words, and caresses, on this
                     mundane sphere. The cares, and other affections of life are constantly and
                     imperiously calling. Social laws, invented at the demand of the humanities,
                     pleasures, virtues, vices, passions—answering to all the innumerable wants and
                     follies of man, must be obeyed.
                  A man and a girl may learn one of the sweet ways to heaven while on horseback,
                     riding in the night air under the soft light of the moon, as in a trance;
                     still, at the end, they stand, immeasurably happy to be sure—still, they stand
                     at the sick bedside of Mr. Smith.
                  Eureka's old friend was very ill when we arrived at his house. Dr. Jansen had
                     entered upon his professional duties, and after completing a careful
                     examination into the situation of the sick man, pronounced that he would have a
                     favorable "run" of the disease, and that there was no occasion for serious
                     alarm. He nursed his patient through the remaining portion of the night,
                     bringing him into a cheerful state of mind as morning dawned. Daylight having
                     arrived, he partook of breakfast with us, after which he departed, promising to
                     call again the next day.
                  In the course of the forenoon my friends, McAllister and Jordan, came. They
                     staid with me until the next morning, when I parted with them, they proceeding
                     to the East and bearing with them proper messages to my friends of the old home
                     neighborhood.
                  They subsequently purchased and removed to some very good farming lands in
                     Michigan lying along the line of the Central Railroad, where they still reside,
                     prosperous farmers and valuable citizens to the State.
                  They comprehended all the great capabilities of prairie soil to produce in
                     abundance, rewarding the intelligent
                     husbandman with the fullest fruition of the fruits of the earth for the least
                     amount of labor and capital expended; but I suspect, though without ever having
                     learned the reasons by which they were influenced, that the measurable
                     homogeneity of the soil of Southern Michigan with that of Western New York on
                     which they were reared, and to which they were much attached, decided their
                     preference in favor of that locality.
                  And I do not know as I shall disapprove of their choice. Western New York and
                     Southern Michigan are two of the finest wheat growing regions in the world,
                     with a noticeable advantage in favor of Michigan; her sandy soils producing, if
                     not always in such abundance as the slightly stronger soils of New York, yet,
                     the finest, fairest berry of wheat that has ever yet been propagated in the
                     United States. The flour manufactured from this wheat is of quality so superior
                     that if the millers of the region could preserve their brands from imposition,
                     a barrel of flour stamped with any Southern Michigan brand would soon command
                     quite a pretty little figure more in the Eastern and European markets than any
                     other.
                  With Eureka I watched by the bedside of Mr. Smith during the progress of the
                     fever. The time came, after many days and nights of vigil, when the disease had
                     ascended to its culmination and had expended its wasting powers and most
                     destructive forces on his system, after which Dr. Jansen pronounced him
                     convalescent. He was soon thereafter about again attending to his neglected
                     affairs of the farm.
                  During Mr. Smith's illness I had ample opportunity to test the powers of my
                     Eureka's mind—to discover what amount of knowledge she had stored during the
                     interval of six years that had elapsed since our first meeting. I learned she
                     had made excellent use of the little library left her by her father, and which
                     her old friend had kindly transported to western wilds for her benefit. She had
                     perseveringly made herself a much more thorough scholar and mistress of exact,
                     really useful knowledge, than are most girls, her seniors in years, when
                     graduated at the seminaries.
                  She explained to me that the chief reasons why she had devoted herself to her
                     books so faithfully, were, that her father had instructed her that no
                        lady, having commendable opportunity, would omit to improve her
                     mind, and that she knew I was an educated gentleman, that she implicitly
                     believed I would come for her at some time, and that she was extremely
                     solicitous to quality herself to be a competent and agreeable companion for
                     me.
                  The dear girl! How much I was gratified! Everything she had done had been
                     performed after a consultation with herself to ascertain how my welfare would
                     probably be affected.
                  She was nearly perfect; so far as she had advanced. I could not discover a flaw
                     among her moral, mental, and social powers. She lacked nothing except the
                     finished polish imparted by society, and a knowledge of the ways of the world,
                     to render her superior in every respect to any woman I had ever met. Those
                     advantages I decided she should soon experience.
                  Mr. Smith being now convalescent and about again, I procured the services of a
                     clergyman who administered the holy Sacrament of Marriage to Eureka and myself.
                     We were united in a rough, unsightly old log-house, unattended by friends other
                     than the old couple, and unadorned by the rich trappings of wealth; but there
                     was a beautiful love and faith in our hearts which invested the union with
                     accessorial hopes whose charms were unapproachable by anything we had ever seen
                     or contemplated.
                  Soon after this important event had transpired we gathered together Eureka's
                     souvenirs of her loved and pitied father, bade Mr. Smith and his wife an
                     affectionate adieu, and turned our faces hopefully toward the home of my
                     childhood—the State of my nativity.
                  Meantime, while conducting my Pride and my bride with a fond
                     solicitude back among the cities of the civilized, I will improve the
                     opportunity to complete my notice of Mr. Smith.
                  When Mr. Smith first came to Missouri, not feeling equal to the task of
                     commencing on the actual "wild," he had purchased a squatter's claim to eighty
                     acres of land. The purchase exhausting all the means he could command, he
                     trusted to his labor and the produce to be obtained from his "eighty" to create
                     a sufficient capital with which to
                     satisfy the demands of government; there being an understanding between himself
                     and the agent at the Land Office for the district, that, if any one should call
                     with reference to the purchase of this particular "lot," he should be
                     immediately notified of the fact.
                  The old man settled down on his "improvement" and went quietly to work,
                     believing himself safe, thinking that, if, at the worst, anyone should attempt
                     to purchase the land from under him, he could borrow the needful hundred
                     dollars by paying a high rate of interest. Time rolled on. Nearly two years had
                     slipped silently and almost unobserved into that past where they could never be
                     recalled, and still the needful hundred dollars had not accumulated. In fact,
                     times had been hard, and he had, by practicing the strictest economy, laid by
                     but twenty-five dollars.
                  Only twenty-five dollars from two seasons of harvest; and now the notification
                     had arrived that a covetous man had placed his eye on the valuable little
                     property and was about to purchase a title over the old man's head. He sought
                     for money and could not find it at any price. There was, really, none to be
                     had. These afflictive matters, fretting, had preyed upon his mind, weighing it
                     down, so that when the fever came, demanding admittance, it found the doors all
                     flung open in token that the physical body was ready to receive and entertain
                     the deadly visitant.
                  That I opportunely came was a matter of great consequence to Mr. Smith as well
                     as to Eureka.
                  He could have received assistance from his children—supposing he could have
                     made them acquainted with his circumstances in time; the government agent, his
                     friend at the Land Office, could not delay the sale of the land beyond a
                     reasonable length of time without incurring trouble to himself—but to none of
                     his children would he apply.
                  He had, in former years, when struggling with poverty on the Pennsylvania
                     mountain, received offers of assistance from his sons, who were prospering,
                     some in his own, and others in other States; but with an obstinacy
                     characteristic in that family descended of the forge, the anvil, and the
                     hammer, and which obstinacy asserts itself in various, and sometimes peculiar
                     forms, he had refused to accept it; asserting his ability to care for himself
                     and wife and half-a-dozen more if need be.
                  And now in case of real need, he would not ask for assistance from his children
                     because he had formerly refused it when proffered.
                  By repeatedly representing to him the great kindness he had done me by
                     befriending Eureka, and with her entreaties added, I finally prevailed with him
                     to accept seventy-five dollars from my abundance, and allow me to visit the
                     Land Office and purchase the warrant, or patent. I might have acted without
                     speaking to him but I saw if I purchased without his concurrence he would never
                     accept the land from me.
                  And I believe had he needed the whole hundred, he would have refused my aid,
                     have allowed the covetous man to take the land, and would have commenced in a
                     new place with an abundance of "pluck," old as he was; because he had seriously
                     maintained to the last that Eureka had "paid her way;" and he had, while
                     prostrated with the fever, seriously contemplated the abandonment of all, and
                     commencing again, though I had assured him on my first arrival and learning the
                     principal cause of his illness that he need not trouble his mind about the
                     land—he should not lose it.
                  Mr. Smith was decidedly an honest, independent man. Often, when I call to mind
                     the grieved, troubled countenance he carried around after I had taken advantage
                     of his helplessness and paid Dr. Jansen's bill, have I regretted the act. He
                     refunded the sum about a year after my return East, and is now, I hope, at
                     peace with himself. Though his mind was rather narrow in some respects, I can
                     say of him as I have remarked concerning my lamented father-in-law:—
                  "It pleases me to think he is one of my kind."
                  Thus I dismiss him and return now again to my own agreeable theme.
                  With fond care I conducted my bride and my Pride back among the
                     cities of the civilized.
                  Having letters of introduction from respectable and influential members of the
                     ruling society in Eastern cities to people of the same class in St. Louis,
                     Louisville and Cincinnati, and the opportunity being agreeable, I passed some
                     time in the latter cities while on my return homeward. I introduced my young
                     wife to the allurements of city life, desiring to measure her capacity for
                     enjoyment and to test her powers for
                     proving herself superior to the allurements of fashion and folly; those twin
                     banes of the female nature presenting themselves, as they do, in their most
                     enchanting, enticing forms in city halls and parlors.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *No fling is particularly intended, menacing city society with
                        disreputation. The best of society is constantly laying itself open to
                        cavil. Sensible people are aware that fashion and folly pervade, to some
                        extent, all classes of society when in congregation, both in city and
                        country. Nor do I design to maintain that the prevalence in society of
                        those twins of destruction is to the destruction of the social compact,
                        but that they are always there, and that their abuses and the abuses
                        which they countenance are extremely hurtful.
                     I do not indicate a remedy. I think a remedy cannot be found this side
                        the Millenium.
                  
                  Eureka was young, a novice in city life, and I had some fears for her, as
                     regarded her ability to sustain her perfect integrity in the three great
                     essentials—the moral, the intellectual, and the social powers, by which the
                     cultured and refined judge of the individual character. But I was with her to
                     guard and to instruct; still, I need not have alarmed myself.
                  Her dresses fitted to perfection at the outset; and nature had so blessed her
                     that she could wear anything charmingly and gracefully. Except that at her
                     first few appearances in select society, when her manner occasionally reflected
                     some slight shades of rusticity, which soon wore off as she profited by her
                     keen observation to use her excellent abilities of intelligence and tact, she
                     appeared as well bred as the best in any circle that we entered.
                  And otherwise; she was always the same true, earnest, steadfast girl of my
                     first acquaintance. Nothing could swerve her from an earnest adherence to the
                     greatest magnet of the soul—Truth, and a tenacious singleness of desire and
                     purpose to deserve my approbation.
                  Daily, as together, preserved by the bonds of a holy love and an exalted
                     reverence for Truth from the many vanities that assailed her, we threaded the
                     mazes—the fascinating intricacies of city life, I discovered reason to wonder
                     that amid so many temptations there was a woman who could live so true a life.
                     I wondered that there was even one of Eve's daughters who had never made, and
                     who did never make, in the least, even by inadvertence, cause to blush for our
                     common mother. And I wondered still more, that I, of all men, had won and was
                     wearing the treasure so eagerly coveted, but never before secured, from Adam
                     down.
                  Nightly, when we retired to the privacy of our room, did I sit long times with
                     the dear, dear form of the enchantress filling my enraptured gaze—her
                     perfections filling and flooding my soul, and thank God in my secret heart for
                     the marvel.
                  
                     This was Love.
                  
                  I saw before me an eternity of bliss; and my faith now is strong that I shall
                     enjoy the reality forever, and yet forever.
                  Ah, man! man! Ah, woman! woman! woman! why will you so
                     persistently, so universally, allow your vices and your follies to exclude you
                     from this dear, this royal, this glorious Heaven?
                  
                  Happy, happy, very happy we were; still, the reader must not anticipate that we
                     escaped all the annoyances those must expect who associate with human kind. You
                     and your love may carry heaven in your own hearts, but it does not therefore
                     follow that the rest of mankind are thus blessed. Their souls may give harbor
                     to the world as the best ship, and perhaps sometimes to the devil. During our
                     visits in the cities named, prolonged through the winter, one circumstance,
                     though harmless in itself, particularly annoyed us both. Eureka's adventure
                     with the panther had been published and extolled throughout the country. This
                     we first began to learn in St. Louis, people had become so universally
                     acquainted with the exploit.
                  Naturally therefore, when introductions were made in society—its members having
                     an advance knowledge of the circumstance and of the locality from which she had
                     come, on hearing the name Eureka, and its interpretation recurring to memory,
                     would almost invariably greet her with an exclamation, like:—
                  "Why! you must be the girl who fought with the panther! The name is so uncommon
                     it certainly can be no other person!"
                  Of course she or I would acknowledge the truth of the matter; and then of
                     course too the story must be repeated. This occurred so often, many desiring to
                     hear the story from her own lips, even after the connections of name, person,
                     and the circumstances were generally and well known, that the repetition became
                     exceedingly disagreeable; and it
                     promising to continue an increasing annoyance, we decided to drop the name for
                     a time. Therefore, when about to leave St. Louis, though the name Eureka was
                     very dear, I set it aside and commenced to address my wife by her mother's
                     name, and she remembering to respect the change, and I giving a caution to such
                     of my friends as it seemed desirable, which caution they have always
                     religiously heeded, now—we not having yet deemed it advisable to resume again
                     her own dear name—in the home of my birth, where we reside, not even my, nor
                     her, dearest friends suspect who was, and is, Eureka Dare; though they have
                     perused in the papers, with awe struck nerves, the thrilling account of the
                     Western heroine, "Found It's" encounter with the "Indian's Devil."
                  Completing our visits and bidding adieu in early spring to the pleasures of the
                     cities named, I escorted my Pride toward my home in my native
                     town. We arrived there safely, in good health, and happy, and have there since
                     lived most of the time during the few months intervening between now and then.
                     Every day since has opened to us the enjoyment of a rational, but exalted
                     happiness—a state of existence of which few people can boast.
                  
                     It will continue. Our faith is of the triumphant sort. God may
                     separate us for a season; but if he shall, no other love can ever interpose. We
                        know that our union is to last with eternity.
                  I had previously informed her that I contemplated writing a brief history of
                     the principal events in our lives, separate and joint, believing it superior to
                     any mere romance to leave behind us in MS. for the instruction of our
                     posterity, and perhaps future generations universally if any of our descendants
                     in the future should desire to publish it to the world. Now, having written, I
                     desired her opinion and feelings with regard to the project.
                  She had finished reading the MS. so far as completed. Then, her fine, sensitive
                     nature shrinking from the apparent parade of our happiness in so conspicuous a
                     manner before the public, even though that public should be only our own
                     children, and though they should not receive the story until long after we
                     should have ceased to exist, and also although they should then be unaware of
                     our identity, she nestled herself deeper into my sheltering arms to show that
                     she was all mine if she did object, and lifting her eloquent eyes into mine,
                     she asked:—
                  "Is it best, Nelson?"
                  I had reflected long and seriously on the question:—Whether is it
                     just that a man withhold good that he may give? I had decided that it is not,
                     unless by so doing he commit a greater injustice. Remembering this, and
                     reflecting now that our written biography might be of much value left in the
                     hands of our children to be used at their discretion, and that but for her
                     those children could have no existence, I clasped her closer and said:—
                  "Is Eureka sorry that I strangled and bruised the serpent; for, is it not good
                     that a good deed be known; and was not the life of my darling saved that all
                     the acts of her life may be so many goodnesses?"
                  With a quick impulsive movement she released herself from my enclosing arms;
                     with a swift, light bound she sprang to the little cradle wherein lay
                        our treasure—our first born; swiftly and tenderly she gathered
                        It in her arms, covered It with a great
                     multitude of kisses, and then replacing It carefully and tenderly
                     in It's little bed, she returned as swiftly to her old seat.
                  Again nestling in my embrace, and again lifting her eloquent eyes into mine,
                     and now I saw they were illumined with the pathos of an immense love—the pathos
                     of a love so great that it had become sad in its aspect—profound, mighty love
                     is always solemn—thus, with the joy of a love influencing her, so exquisite
                     that it was soaring to the altitude of pain, she lifted those eloquent eyes
                     again into mine, saying:—
                  "You always know best. I am a wife and a mother, and wedded with you. What do I care for anything else? I am so happy! O
                     Nelson!"
                  What a volume of happiness her soul in felicity exhibited in the utterance of
                     those two words—"O Nelson!"
                  She was too much under the influence of deliciously exquisite emotions to
                     immediately comply with the desire of her heart to voice the whole of her
                     happiness into my listening, greedy ear; but presently she opened wide the book
                     of her soul, and therein I read inscribed in golden capitals on the sacred
                     leaf:—
                  
                  "Nelson! Nelson! I cannot do without your love; but you must not
                     caress me too often with your dear voice or the dearer embrace, for it will
                     kill me; I love you so!"
                  [End of Mr. Bascom's Narrative.]
               
               
                  EDITOR'S NOTES ON MR. BASCOM'S TALE.
                  As I, the rewriter, concluded the reading of the foregoing story to the same
                     company to whom I had read the first two chapters on a former occasion—the same
                     company, excepting that young Bluff-'Em-Off was now absent and
                     the Cynic's beautiful wife present—little Miss Pert broke forth
                     in an exclamation of pleasurable astonishment; she having kept the idea
                     uppermost in her thoughts to the conclusion:—
                  "O my! Did you ever! And are you really going to leave us at the head of the
                     third chapter?"
                  
                     Writer:—"Certainly; that is my intention. Miss Pert has no
                     objections has she?"
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"No, sir! I guess I han't. It's too nice for that; if
                     you do talk so about me and the black bear in another place. Ida! Ida Dimond!
                     Did you hear him? He says we are to be at the head of the third chapter!"
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"My ears are no sluggards."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"Then why don't you say something? What a cold, sober
                     girl you are sometimes! I declare, sometimes I lose all patience with you," and
                     she pettishly gave Miss Dimond's right ear two or three light snaps.
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"Please excuse my cars. They are not the offenders.
                     I have no objections to sharing with you the honor of holding a place in the
                     third chapter; but I do not regard the matter as of sufficient importance to
                     make a fuss about."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"Well, you are the curiousest girl!"
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—Laughing and sarcastically: "No doubt. As wonderful
                     a curiosity as the black bear."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"The wretch! Only to think! As many times as he has
                     seen me! And now to insinuate that I have so little knowledge of natural
                     history!"
                  
                     Writer:—"Forgive me! I have made a breach in the laws of good
                     breeding for the sake of preserving a fine and pointed simile. But now I'm in
                     for it, will not Miss Pert be generous, allow me to continue in rudeness, and
                     ask her what she does know about that great king in American zoology. I will
                     acknowlege that her last speech has made me feel quite curious and
                     interested."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"Yes, I know; you think because I chatter so much I
                     don't know anything. But I'd have you know I haven't been to the menagerie a
                     dozen times without using my eyes."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"Well, tell us about the bear."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"Yes, as he has acknowledged his errors, I will, to
                     oblige him. Ugh! the great, horrid ugly monster! Such great big
                     strong legs, almost as big as his body; and great sharp, shining claws as big
                     as a man's finger; and then his lurid, wicked eyes and his great long horrid
                     ugly snout, filled all full of great, white, gleaming, hungry tushes!"
                  The company smiled audibly.
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"Which is the horrid monster, Mr. Beal or the
                     bear?"
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"Both of them!"
                  
                     Writer:—"Thank you, Miss Pert. I have judged you uncharitably.
                     You are a sensible girl—and generous."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"I know it."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—Changing the subject abruptly and addressing herself
                     particularly to me, desirous to satisfy her mind with regard to some points in
                     the story that were troubling her, or that she did not like:—
                  "Allow me to interpose between you and Miss Pert. There are one or two
                     inconsistencies, and an attack on moral principle in the story if I do not
                     misjudge, concerning which, I desire, if you please, enlightenment."
                  
                     Writer:—"Certainly, Miss Dimond. It will please me to make
                     everything lucid to your comprehension. Be pleased to state the subjects for
                     consideration and explanation."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"I will first commence with that which is of least
                     importance, thus reversing the usual system of order observed in the conduct of
                     business transactions. But where I commence will be of little consequence;
                     women are so universally charged by men with conducting business matters
                     without regard to any system merely to suit their own caprices that we seldom get credit for doing
                     just right when men are judges."
                  
                     Writer:—"Rather severe on us, are you not, Miss Dimond?"
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—Smiling:—"Perhaps! But you know I am three-quarters
                     right in the allegation."
                  
                     Writer:—"Nay! nay! It is not policy for me to acknowledge my sex
                     so culpable."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—Laughing saucily:—"No, not policy
                     certainly; but I understand. You will not convict your sex of its faults; so I
                     may as well proceed with my criticism of the story. My first exception to the
                     narrative is:—It does not read just as it ought, in all places, if it be
                     addressed by a father to his children, that being the spirit in which Mr.
                     Bascom claims it has been prepared. I should infer from the general tone and
                     language that it has been more particularly prepared for the public mind;
                     though there are still some delicate matters of which it does not seem that a
                     man of Mr. Bascom's refinement could impart a knowledge to the public, even in
                     the light of his notions concerning the doing of justice to the world. It
                     appears to me that there is a betrayal of sacred secrets that should have been
                     kept sacred with himself and wife."
                  
                     Writer:—"Your criticism is eminently just, Miss Dimond. The
                     incongruities and trespasses on the affections which you remark, have
                     unavoidably volunteered themselves to my mind as essentials in the story though
                     it was not intended for the public, and have been accepted and retained by me
                     and placed among the alterations I have made to fit the tale for public
                     reading. Every sentence of the original MS. is addressed by Mr. Bascom to his
                     children with the nicest, most delicate propriety."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"I am very glad to learn it. I am half in love with
                     Eureka's husband, though I can readily perceive he is not by any means
                     sinless.
                  
                     Writer:—"We agree perfectly in that respect, Miss Dimond."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"My next exception is that: according to the
                     continuities of the story, Mr. Nelson Bascom must have been either in Europe,
                     Asia, or Africa when he first met Miss Eureka Dare in the State of
                     Pennsylvania."
                  
                     Writer:—Taken aback:—"I acknowledge that you have me there;
                     entirely so, for it is an undiscovered inadvertence of mine, and occurs through
                     no fault of the original writer. Properly, in the original MS., the reading is,
                     that, Nelson Bascom devoted five years to travel from the time he first sailed
                     from New York to California; a little more than a year and a half from New York
                     to California and back, and about three and a half years in the Old World. He
                     had barely returned from his visit to the Old World when he met Eureka in
                     Pennsylvania. Such discrepancies are pretty apt to slip in when an author
                     transforms another's thoughts into language of his own, unless he practice the
                     most untiring vigilance."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"That is quite satisfactory. And now then for my
                     most serious objection to Mr. Bascom's histories. I think I am correct in
                     surmising that 'grog' is the sailor's term for intoxicating beverages, the same
                     that 'grub' is his term for food?"
                  
                     Writer:—"Quite correct, as you have comprehended it, Miss Dimond.
                     'Grog' is the sailor's name for whisky and all liquors of that
                     description."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"I think from the tone of the narrative, wherein it
                     treats of the sin of Broderick Dare, that the reader should very naturally
                     arrive at the conclusion that Mr. Bascom is a condemner of the use of ardent
                     spirits, and yet he thanks Captain P—with much warmth for an 'extra can of
                     grog' while they were rounding the Horn."
                  
                     Writer:—"There is some truth, Miss Dimond, in what you say. Mr.
                     Bascom has condemned in Broderick Dare, though not in special language, yet in
                     spirit, the use of liquor as a beverage; yet he does himself, now, occasionally
                     drink rum. How he reconciles this with his implied judgment on the fate of his
                     father-in-law I am unable to say."
                  I glanced severely kind at the Cynic.
                  
                     Cynic:—"Ladies and gentlemen: I am acquainted with this Nelson
                     Bascom and think I understand his position. He does condemn the use of ardent
                     spirits as abused by his deceased father-in-law. When drunk to excess it is
                     hateful in his sight. But he considers that all things of the earth, good and
                     bad, are placed under man's control to use or abuse, as suits him best;
                     enjoying, of course, the compensations—the rewards or the penalties which he
                     earns or merits.
                  
                  
                     Writer:—"Do you allow the weak in will facilities for abusing
                     themselves with poisons without check or restraint?"
                  
                     Cynic:—"I was speaking for Mr. Bascom and will continue, at
                     present, to do so. He thinks, that in the case of alcoholic drinks, those
                        stimulants should be administered by the strong-willed to the
                     weak-willed as may be needful."
                  
                     Writer:—"Then the position is abandoned as untenable that all
                     good and all bad things are put in man's control to use properly or to
                     abuse?"
                  
                     Cynic:—"No, sir! Here is where the rewards and penalties should
                     be made to intervene. When the weak-willed man commences the abuse of liquor,
                     and thus demonstrates that he is weak-willed, and is therefore not
                     really a man, and consequently not fit to take care of himself, then the
                     strong-willed man may, should, and will, if God deems it best,
                     interfere as a Providential agent and award the penalty of abstinence to the
                     drunkard, thus averting a more direct Providential visitation of displeasure in
                     the future, as in the case of Mr. Dare. The same law will also apply, of
                     course, with reference to all poisons, and should be made to
                     apply most particularly in the case of tobacco, which is most surely killing
                     the virility of this nation and sending it down to hell."
                  
                     Writer:—"How does Mr. Bascom propose to organize this
                     Providential state of society wherein the strong-willed are to rule just
                     right?"
                  I mentally acknowledged the complete truth of Mr. Bascom's assertion concerning
                     tobacco, but thought best not to give my thoughts oral expression.
                  
                     Cynic:—"If a people have arrived at the proper moral altitude to
                     bless themselves in this regard, they will place all liquors and other poisons
                     in the custody of Physicians and other gentlemen who are blessed with
                     sufficient judgment and strength of character to discriminate and refuse
                     improper applications."
                  
                     Writer:—"Who is to be the judge of character? Every man of
                     himself, will judge himself competent; the weak, the bad, and all."
                  
                     Cynic:—"Yes: that is true. Still, the people at large, should, as
                     God's only instruments for effecting any necessary regeneration or redemption
                     among themselves, be the judges."
                  
                     Writer:—"Dare you, at all times, trust so grave a matter in the
                     hands of a multitude, hoping that it shall receive the treatment of
                     inspiration?"
                  
                     Cynic:—"Yes, at all times. Whether or not it receive the
                     treatment of inspiration. The people will use the ballot—which should be the
                     real law-making, or law-establishing power—according as they are worthy. Though
                     I should not consort with a society that is in a state of degradation, still, I
                     say, if a people occupy a place so low in the scale of existence that they
                     listen to demagogues and the corrupt, then, it is right that such shall rule
                     them."
                  
                     Writer:—"And meantime, if demagogues rule, and riot, drunkenness,
                     and all the vices prevail, what is to become of us who do not relish such a
                     state of society?"
                  
                     Cynic:—"We must accept the situation in the faith that if God
                     designs we shall achieve a regeneration, the words of inspiriation will find
                     their way from our hearts to our lips, and thence leap forth in due season to
                     perform their mission. Pope was very nearly right when he wrote: 'Whatever is, is right.' Let it read:—Whatever is, it is right that it be,
                     while it is, and the maxim is perfect. If God does not design that we, or any
                     others, shall act as reformers, then of course we, and those around us, are not
                     fit to be blessed with good government, and must, willing or unwilling, accept
                     accordingly the inevitable penalties or consequences."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"Gentlemen, your conversation is entertaining and
                     instructive, and the unknown Mr. Bascom continues to mount in my esteem, and I
                     hope his theory may be soon introduced into practice as something much better
                     than anything we have now, still, I must say it would be better for all were
                     the motto, 'Touch not, taste not,' universally adopted with regard to all
                     ardent spirits."
                  Now this conversation had all been very tiresome to the lively Miss Pert, who
                     wanted a "say" of her own, and that "say" was not at all this style of thing.
                     So, now seeing a good chance, she quickly followed up Miss Dimond, spiritedly
                     introducing:—
                  "O do let liquor take care of itself, and don't be so prosy. I want to hear
                     something exciting, you good Old Bachelor story-writer, you! aren't you going
                     to tell us who Nelson Bascom and
                     Eureka are? I know by the way you've talked they're somebody you know."
                  
                     Writer:—"I am happy to say, Miss Pert, that should the question
                     be asked I am empowered to gratify your curiosity. The hero and heroine are not
                     afraid to trust their secret with your discretion."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—All on the qui
                     vive:—"Well, come! tell us quick!"
                  
                     Writer:—"The hero is that comely gentleman standing there in easy
                     attitude with his back to the fire. The heroine is that lovely lady, now an
                     inch taller than she was at sixteen, who sits so gloriously beautiful close by
                     your side, with her foot in its appropriate place on the cradle-rocker."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—Spasmodically springing to the young mother's side,
                     throwing her arms around her neck and covering her face all over with
                     kisses:—
                  "O how charming! O, Mr. Beal! I never suspected!" then falling back
                     half-hysterically into the sofa.
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—Advancing swiftly from the opposite side of the
                     room; opening her arms to the meeting embrace offered, and placing, first her
                     lips to the brow of the lovely Eureka, then:—
                  "I always knew you had a most agreeable heart history, but I had not thought it
                     quite so delightful."
                  "Dear friends! my lines are indeed drawn in pleasant places," devoutly said the
                     Cynic's beautiful wife.
                  And for once I beheld women, as they sometimes do when exclusively by
                     themselves, abandon themselves to some of the strongest emotions of the female
                     nature, unrestrained, and forgetful of masculine presence.
                  
                     Miss Pert:—Having recovered from her partial syncope:—"What a
                     dear Old Bachelor and delicious story-teller you are! Take care, or I shall be
                     asking you to marry me yet! Stranger things than that have
                     happened.
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—Facetiously:—"May be after getting him you won't
                     want him. Perhaps, now, he isn't so smart after all. Perhaps the genius, what little there is, all lies in the Original MS. And perhaps too
                     his rendition is not equal to that. I wish we could see the Original!"
                  
                     Writer:—Laughing sympathetically:—"Who knows! Many a fine MS.
                     passes under the revision of the Censors for the Literary Periodicals, who
                     pocket for attempted corrections rections and elaborations fifty per cent. of
                     the price paid, after which it emerges to the public, very often, with some of
                     its finest beauties mutilated, entirely defaced, or super-ceded with
                     insipidities. Perhaps I may have treated Mr. Bascom's MS. in some such
                     manner."
                  
                     Miss Dimond:—"Ah! I see! Mr. Beal. My poor attempt at a joke has
                     brought me in some valuable information."
                  
                     Writer:—"Thank you, Miss!"
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"Bother the Periodicals and the Censors! I don't care
                     anything about them, now. And I don't care how fine the Original
                     may be, either. I like the story just as it is. And I hope you'll put into it
                     all this talk and all the scenes we've been having to-day. You'll be a dear
                     good man and do it, won't you now?"
                  
                     Writer:—"To be sure I will. That has been the design all along,
                     unless Miss Pert and the company should object."
                  
                     Miss Pert:—"O the provoking! You know you have our consent before
                     asking."
                  This reply of Miss Pert's driving me back to her declaration concerning
                        marriage, I responded: a little caustically, I fear—I say
                        fear, because I do really like the girl in a fatherly way very
                     much!—
                  "Save me from Lingua, and from Tela, most particularly."
                  The Cynic laughed.
                  His wife—not as fearing me at all, but as into a more congenial atmosphere—her
                     eyes and countenance opening and growing warm to him, fled into, what was to
                     her, his omnipotent, sheltering presence.
                  Miss Dimond looked and acted that she felt hurt, and was indulging some hard
                     feelings toward the speaker, which caused me to feel a little compunctious in
                     the region round about the heart; old as I am, and as near ossified as my heart
                     is supposed to be, I can but think what a splendid appearing woman she is—how
                     handsome, and how queenly in presence when she wills to be.
                  Miss Pert, not understanding the "ancient," very discreetly kept silent, and
                     assuming a complacent nonchalance, thrummed
                     lightly with her fingers on the piano.
                  And dare you believe it! O eloquent reader! just at that identical instant that
                     little rascal in the cradle had the impudence to raise Its voice
                     in my brazen Old Bachelor face, and salute the company with Its
                     first genuine crow.
                  
                  NOTE.—The foregoing story from real life was prepared for publication about the
                     year 185-, but owing to influencing reasons of a private character it has been
                     deemed best not to offer it to the public acceptance until now. The
                     conversation just previously recorded transpired but a few years before Miss
                     Dimond's marriage with her cousin Julius, a circumstance that is related in the
                     story: Apples and Chestnuts. As I have stated in a previous
                     note: The interesting Miss Pert of this story is an elder sister of the Miss
                     Pert whom I have mentioned in The Manly Art. There is an
                     exceeding interesting tale hanging by the courtship of the Miss Pert of that
                     story, recently transpired. Perhaps I may some time relate it. And perhaps I
                     ought also to say in this note, that I was not so very old a Bachelor when I
                     rewrote and read Mr. Bascom's story as related. The boys at that time called,
                     and I suppose in a spirit of mischief delighted to call me an Old Bachelor
                     because I had lived along for several years at a marriageable age without
                     having made any serious advances to any one of the numerous charming girls
                     surrounding; and occasionally a girl chimed in.
                  ANOTHER NOTE; Which is of Value to the Reader.—Mr. Bascom is an
                     only child. He was the son of Old Israel Dimond's oldest daughter, and is of
                     about the same age with John and Will Dimond and Solomon Ingoldsby. His father
                     was in quite indigent circumstances all his life until the son made his
                     fortunate trip to California, supporting his wife and child as a common day
                     laborer on the farm. After the son, Nelson's return from the land of gold he
                     "slicked himself up" and made the presence of quite a fine, presentable
                     personage. He immediately took to travel on the strength of his son's wealth,
                     enjoying the new mode of life hugely. He says while on his journeys he has
                     often been approached by individuals of distinguished presence who think he may
                     be some one of the many heavy moneyed men of the country. Says he:—
                  "When they come pryin' round tryin' to stick their noses into what's none of
                     their biz'ness, I 'snicker in my sleeve' and keep my secrets."
                  He is now nearly seventy years old, but still continues to travel. If you shall
                     ever meet on car or steamboat, a well-dressed dressed, hale, white-haired old
                     man, nearly six feet high, wearing a fine gold chain around his neck, with an
                     elegantly chased gold watch at the end; no cane; open, pleasant countenance,
                     and smiling gray eyes; and who readily and fluently converses in rather faulty
                     grammar—that's he.

               DIAMOND LEAVES
               VI.
               BOYD DIMOND.
               
                  THIS fine young man died at the early age of twenty-three. His mind was
                     esteemed by the ablest of teachers as exhibiting indications that it might
                     mature as one of the best in the country.
                  Persevering, resolute, amiable, and talented, he was profoundly admired by all
                     who knew him. His superior genius, genuine kindness of heart and undoubted
                     courage were recognized and approved by all; his elder brothers, even, John and
                     William, being emulous to honor him as higher than themselves.
                  The Faculty of the College where he was graduated, as able a corps of teachers
                     as there was in the land at the time, prophesied that his future career would
                     be one of the most brilliant and useful, let him embrace what profession he
                     might, that the country had witnessed for a long time.
                  All competent judges who were so happy as to get his acquaintance were of the
                     same mind. His moral and intellectual powers were so serene, firm, and
                     stable—of so superior an order, and were so happily balanced, and combined
                     together in such just and perfect proportions, that the writer of this notice,
                     who considers himself as having been blessed in the young man's friendship,
                     deems his merits deserved all the great amounts of encomium his admiring
                     friends bestowed.
                  But the excellent and gifted one died. His college course was scarce completed,
                     when God saw fit to call his excellences to himself, and deprive the world of
                     an ornament and an instructor such as too seldom graces the higher walks of
                     life. The intellectual, the refined, the generous Boyd Dimond died, lamented by
                     a multitude of the best and the noblest.
                  
                  There were left behind a father, mother, nine brothers and sisters of natures
                     the most affectionate, a sweet young wife, who worshiped him with an idolatrous
                     affection, and a very large circle of the warmest of friends, to mourn his
                     loss.
                  Also, there was a posthumous son born to his memory, whose young years have
                     never experienced the kind and wise paternal care so intelligent and amiable a
                     father as he would have made would have given. The son is now a well grown
                     youth, whose promise is so excellent that his friends enjoy a gratifying hope
                     that his talents and attainments may, in the future, rival those of the worthy
                     and gifted father.
                  Succeeding, I have transcribed one of the few papers left behind by him at his
                     decease, evidences of the rare and great powers to which he might have attained
                     could he have lived until his rich mind should have become perfectly expanded
                     and matured.

                  THE BARBARA LEWTHWAITE OF WORDSWORTH AND OF DE QUINCEY.
                  CHILD AND WOMAN.
                  There are probably few, if any, American scholars who have not reviewed De
                     Quincey. Standing pre-eminent, as he does, among the representative writers for
                     the English periodic press of the current century, it would be branding the
                     American 
                        literatii
                        literati
                      with a want of sense to deem it otherwise. It is, then, confidently
                     assumed that all have read this author.
                  And resting on this, here, thus early, the writer proceeds to indicate his
                     point: for, my reader, none ever write without a purpose—none ever read without
                     a purpose; and yet, anomalous as it may seem, I do challenge that the readings
                     which American, and perhaps I may too say British, scholars have given to De
                     Quincey are purposeless—not absolutely so in all respects, but entirely and
                     completely so when reviewed with reference to the bearings which portions of
                     his writings may exercise on what Christian people regard as one of the
                     greatest of cardinal truths.
                  What! he, Thomas De Quincey! a Christian? I scorn the assumption and the
                     pretence, both on his own part and on the part of those who may declare for
                     him.
                  And why have none of the many of the powerful, clear thinkers among us unmasked
                     the arrogant pretender, and shown up his hollowness and falseness to the world?
                     There can be but this—they cannot have passed him by as not an accountable
                     being; he reasons, generally, too lucidly and too well for
                     that—there can, then, be but this: they have never discovered him.
                     Because, how poor, and lame, and faint must that heart be which will not
                     attempt to strike down him who is covertly striving to crush, or destroy, its
                     own divinity; and we know there are true souls among the Christian community
                     whose hearts are not poor, nor lame, nor faint.
                  I would not have it imagined I am condemning De Quincey utterly. Far from it.
                     There are some of his papers which, when understandingly studied, throw an
                     elucidating light upon some of the grandest of hitherto hidden truths. And
                     also, nearly all are written in a style which drapes his literature with a
                     sweet haughtiness the most fascinating. It is something which may be regarded
                     as entirely external to the man—to his real personality—something pervading his
                     writings at an immeasurable distance from the real him—something
                     flowing out, as an ethereal, crystal essence from a black caldron filled with
                     liquids of light, intermixed with boiling, black impurities, and revealing,
                     when refined, how pure and how lofty a pride may exist in composition—in
                     thought of itself when considered entirely separate from the Originator.
                  This is what he in his palmy days might have styled the "pomp of letters and of
                     ideas skillfully arranged."
                  Let all read this author. The novice in learning who aspires to earn a fame
                     which shall hand his name down to admiring after generations, can, after
                     assuring himself of De Quincey's fault, advantageously study an imagination
                     that is sweet, fanciful, fascinating, scarce second to any; and a style which,
                     if not always compact and smooth, is at least always spicy, racy, vigorous, and
                     awakening. But of this also he may further assure himself, that—after having revelled for many a pleasant summer
                     day among some of those splendors which, emanating from any intellect, always
                     crown and glorify the province of letters as in an heavenly illumination, he
                     will have learned that an interest—a craving for the profoundest sublime—for a
                     knowledge of the secrets of the matchless Infinite, has been created, which
                     with the closing of the last volume still lives unsatisfied. Opening and
                     reading De Quincey, he will learn that the soul is seemingly continually
                     invited into a far-reaching for the food which shall nourish and satisfy its
                     hungry appetite for the illimitable, the grand, the good; but with all his
                     effort put forth to reach and grasp the deluding fair promise—the perpetual
                     elusion, which until the end he firmly anticipates will be fulfilled, he will
                     have learned at the last, that his interesting author has still left his mind
                     in a state of dissatisfaction; he will have learned that it is as if his author
                     had undertaken for the reader's sole benefit to penetrate and fathom all the
                     entire subtle mystery of the great Thought, and after making
                     superhuman exertions to accomplish that grand result, has—failed.
                  What is De Quincey's great fault? Have I not named it? A denyer of Christ and
                     of God.
                  Probably his sad state of mind originated in what I have adverted to but just
                     above, namely:—his inability to sound the profound heights and depths of the
                     Eternal.
                  But that is mere speculation, some may cavil.
                  To that I answer:—No matter. Except that its elucidation might serve to warn
                     others who may be deluded into the same paths of error my supposition is not of
                     sufficient importance to any of us for me to argue its truth. I merely for my
                     own satisfaction, and to give the reader the benefit of the inference, if he
                     desire it, after having noted the general tenor of De Quincey's mind as
                     revealed to me in his published works, make the statement that I judge my
                     hypothesis to be correct.
                  What is of importance is the destructibility or the indestructibility of
                     Immortal Life—no, I should have written it God, because the Immortal is not
                     perishable. And is not God immortal? What says our author? Do not imagine he is
                     so bold as to say in so many words that there is no God. You who have read his
                     books know that he has never boldly and explicitly uttered any such profanity.
                     His attack on what is so sacredly upheld by all the holy innate promptings of
                     the heart, supported with the deductions of a heavenly reason, as man's dearest
                     hope, is covert and indirect; the method of attack plainly showing that he
                        fears—that he is not blind to the awful results involved, nor
                     to the awful danger which may be impending over him who thus audaciously takes
                     the axe in his hand and with it severs the cable holding his only remaining
                     best anchor.
                  In alluding to the subject in connection with Words-worth's happy deductions,
                     drawn from the simple language of the innocent and artless little Barbara Lewthwaite, and also in connection with the ingenious arguments of
                     the Pagan Plato in his Phedo, he says:—"The theme concerned being that problem
                     which, measured by its interest to man, by its dependencies, by the infinite
                     jewel staked upon the verdict, we should all confess to be the most solemn and
                     heart-shaking that is hung out by golden chains from the heaven of heavens to
                     human investigation, namely—Is the spirit of man numbered among things
                     naturally perishable?"
                  Truly, it may be said, that—the Power that can hang out by golden chains the
                     problem on whose solution is staked the jewel of infinite value, must of
                     itself, sequently, be infinite, eternal, if it possess the ability to make the
                     exhibition. Here then, despite the doubt implied in the question whether the
                     soul of man be perishable, can be no denial of God! We shall see.
                  But here the imposition may be undertaken that De Quincey is not accountable
                     for his Barbara Lewthwaite. It may be urged that that production
                     is but the vagary of an opium dream; that in anything written in his
                     "Confessions" he does not consider himself as standing before the world an
                     accountable being; that he published those "Confessions" but as a warning to
                     show the awful deep of the degradation into which the indulgence in opium may
                     plunge a living soul. Reader! were the invaluable jewel—the infinite, costly
                     principle involved in his Barbara Lewthwaite not adverted to in
                     others of his papers at which the most indulgent and tolerant cannot hesitate
                     as to his accountability for the production, I would halt here. But it is too
                     solemnly undeniable that others of his papers for which he would proudly claim
                     the most reasonable lucidity and truth in their first inception in his brain,
                     in their subsequent progress, and in
                     their final, absolute, perfect completion, do contain that same principle—that
                     rare jewel trodden down, so far as he is concerned, and trampled into the mire
                     of an eternal night.
                  None however will attempt to deny that he wrote his Barbara
                     Lewthwaite with a cool mind, however it may be undertaken to account for its
                     origination. And possessing as we do, elsewhere in his writings, his sanction
                     of the ethical principle—or lack of any ethical principle, to which he adheres
                     in that paper, we cannot be amiss in understanding that he there expresses his
                     matured and deliberate religious convictions—gives us the key to the morality
                     of his most personal, most secret soul.
                  Interesting it is, but sad to note his first expressed wavering faith or
                     disbelief in God as uttered in his almost matchless apostrophe to solitude,*
                      and trace its gradual but sure declension throughout his life as given
                     by himself in his history—(autobiography?)—marking by the way that the most
                     serious argument he places in his mother's mouth condemnatory of the infidel
                     course pursued by the brilliant Mrs. Lee,†
                      is, that she would be forsaken by the Christian community,—until, after
                     arriving at his most perfect maturity he calmly and deliberately sits down, and
                     after twisting the meaning and intention of Shakspeare‡
                      to suit his own ends—not choosing to remember that the language is put
                     by the great poet into the mouth of one of his literary creations—coolly writes
                     that the total philosophy of life is simply for life itself as we find it here
                     on earth, and that for us there never has been a before and can never be a
                     hereafter. Thus he interprets and endorses:— 
                        
                           "We are such stuff
                           As dreams are made of; and our little life
                           Is rounded by a sleep:—"
                        
                      one of Shakspeare's aphorisms. Or, as in that other paper§
                      where he as cooly expresses himself to the same purpose while coolly
                     and unpityingly traducing the virgin memory and insulting the virgin
                     personality of a spotless, sinless child; and the while, too, that child is
                     addressing him under the holy name of father.

                  What though I had not the happiness to have been born your contemporary*
                      that I might have thrown my defiance in your face! yet, now, I summon
                     your bones to gather themselves up from under the hawthorn of Old England, to
                     compose themselves decently, and stand patient, listening, for I have a few
                     words to say to you, De Quincey. Listen!
                  
                  
                     *It is evident that Mr. Dimond wrote under a mistake with reference to not
                        being contemporary with Mr. De Quincey. His paper, as the date testifies,
                        was written about the year 1853, when Mr. De Quincey must have been still
                        living, as I am confident I have learned of his decease since it came
                        into my possession; but whether or not they were contemporaneous cannot
                        of course affect the value of Mr. Dimond's criticism. N. S. R. B.
                  
                  You ransacked history, sacred and profane—you turned your own mind inside out,
                     searching for proofs to substantiate the truth that the soul of man is
                     immortal. Failing, as you thought, to discover any such proofs, your recreant
                     soul prompted you to impeach, arraign, and condemn, yourself sole accuser and
                     judge, the most delicate, refined, and sacred uprightness of the heart and of
                     reason. You did this with all the vast floods of Light pouring in upon an
                     unusually acute mind from both the material and spiritual worlds. All your
                     Jesuitical proceedings culminated one pleasant May morning in your last,
                     ultimate, horrid judgment, condemning De Quincey, the man, Barbara, the woman,
                     and M—, the little pure child, into blank, nonentity, 0. You left not one of
                     them anything. That is it.
                  Come! keep quiet! I am not surprised that your bones shake in the breeze; but
                     keep quiet and listen. You must. You now know that when you so foolishly
                     recorded the transactions of that bright May morning you as foolishly threw
                     away your right to rule in immortality, and that I have picked it up as a
                     precious and great power, and now have it, and can wield it to command you;
                        and will; so keep quiet.
                  I acknowledge you a seductive and fascinating writer. Even in that most
                     monstrous of your productions, the paper I am now considering, I acknowledge
                     this. Romantic, brilliant, even at times gorgeous in your style, both in the
                     strong, apt, and beautiful suggestiveness of the ideas and in a certain
                     propriety and beauty discoverable in their collocation. Happily sad; sweetly
                     wild; pathetic; serenely gay and grandly passionate, and at the same time a
                     clear-headed, acute reasoner; but yet, Oh, Thomas De Quincey! thou man of sublime powers—thou almost noble
                     man, who hast abundantly evinced in thy writings that thou wast supremely
                     conscious of possessing the remarkable talents that thou hadst,—yet, in
                        Barbara Lewthwaite and in fragments of thy other interesting
                     papers, thou hast discovered thyself to be but a groveler—a mere earth worm. It
                     was not alone opium which filled thy false soul with the horrid chimeras and
                     fears that so tortured it to the direst extremity. He who subscribes to
                     Atheism—to the doctrine of chance, must expect before he arrives at the end, to
                     be scourged utterly beyond all endurance by his own thoughts. So has it been
                     with thee.
                  Go, now, poor spirit! thou hast too summarily disposed of the question
                     concerning Eternal Life so far as De Quincey is concerned. Go! I dismiss thee
                     without further enlightenment. Thou canst expect no better from me; thou who
                     didst presume, in thy monstrous arrogance, to wrench Jehovah from his throne
                     and attempt to render judgment unto those little children of whom it is said
                     that they may not be judged. Go! I can pity and mourn for you, but still,
                     desire to give my mind to more cheerful thoughts.
                  How does De Quincey dispose of the convincing arguments with which the world is
                     filled favorable to the immortality of the soul?
                  First:—He predicates the postulate that Moses is the supreme Biblical
                     authority, incidentally claiming that all Christian writers are secondary or
                     subsidiary to the author of the Pentateuch, and hence argues that there is
                     nothing discoverable in his writings which will support the affirmation that he
                     held a belief in the divinity or the indestructibility of his own soul.
                     Allowing Mr. De Quincey to be correct in his assumption that the Old Jew is
                     Lord of both Testaments, yet there is no particular call to trace him in his
                     argument. A single period, with its simple exposition, from the writings of the
                     great Law-giver will refute his elaborate argument. It reads:—
                  "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him."
                  The writings of Moses are replete with the evidences that he believed himself
                     to be expounding the Law of God—that he was not a charlatan—that himself
                     entirely believed in the righteousness of that which he proclaimed; then how,
                     claiming as he honestly could and did, that his own soul was the counterpart of
                     God's, could he avoid believing in its indestructibility? He could not avoid
                     it. He must believe in it; for, were the soul of man perishable, and the
                     principle of Life, Which is God, indestructible, then there is not a particle
                     of likeness between them. Man would not be existing as the image of his
                     Creator. As is his body a symbol for change, death, and corruption in the
                     material world, so would his soul be in the spiritual or intellectual.
                  But perhaps Moses and the Hebrews did not, after all, apprehend this; perhaps
                     Moses cheated himself and his people with the vagaries of his own mind; perhaps
                     he wrote with his mind in a fog, mystifying himself and them with a pleasing
                     delusion! The thought is too silly to be entertained for a moment. The evidence
                     in the Pentateuch, as well as throughout the Old Testament, internally
                     illuminating to itself, is sufficiently weighty to prove that we moderns are
                     but imbeciles if we presume to argue from the Scriptures that the ancients had
                     not an intellect as sturdy as ours. Their minds may not have been as well
                     cultivated and as versatile as ours; but for going right straight ahead in one
                     straight course and digging out the truth, we are not probably much in advance
                     of them.
                  The careful reader of the Old Testament will have perceived that the book of
                     Genesis so closely assimilates the identity of man with that of God, that the
                     destruction of one involves the annihilation of a part, at least, of itself;
                     hence our author, in adopting the belief that the soul of man is among things
                     naturally perishable, denies the Potentiality of the Creator; in other words,
                     repudiates God as not immutable to sustain himself in Perfection.
                  Well, perhaps, yet once more, this may be true; perhaps the Spirit of God
                        is perishable, and Moses knew it as well as Mr. De Q. How
                     nonsensical! If perishable, the logic is plainer than the nose on
                     your face that there is no God at all—nothing superior to man as
                     our ideas conceive concerning the Great Spirit.
                  De Quincey's manner of treating the Sacred Text being disposed of, it is not
                     particularly a matter of importance to revert to the curt manner in which he
                     arraigns the Pagan literature; his attack thereon being of but secondary
                     consequence to the other. And besides, the great Pagan monument ment, Plato's Phedo, in support of the
                     immortality of the soul lies open to all. Those who desire, and who are not
                     skilled in the Greek, can readily procure some one of the excellent
                     translations, read, and judge for themselves whether the argument in the Phedo
                     is "baseless and puerile."*
                  
                  
                     *The Phedo, whether or not Plato sustains the position he assumes, will
                        well repay a perusal. It is as spirited and interesting a colloquy as has
                        been handed down to us from the ancients.
                  
                  And now I arrive at De Quincey's third and fourth arguments used professedly
                     for demolishing the principle—Providential, or Eternal Life. Those arguments
                     are based on the antipodes of mortal existence, viz.: life and death. Could he
                     sustain himself in those final arguments of his, of course he
                     controverts—demolishes the inspiration and truth claimed by Christians to
                     inhere in the Scriptures; and it is unmistakably plain, as I have demonstrated,
                     those writings vouchsafe, both in the letter and in the spirit, immortality to
                     the Life of man, or to the human soul. But, as I shall now undertake to prove,
                     he does not sustain himself in what he chooses to regard as his final, most
                     strongly fortified position.
                  Life and death being so seemingly paradoxically interblended; occurring
                     alternately and in conjunction with such lightning-like rapidity; chasing,
                     overleaping, and embracing one another in all the rapidly differing phases
                     incident to a vast humanity, all busily, and frequently diversely, engaged in
                     this world of mortal toiling for the happiest immortal; affording to the
                     interested intelligent spectator a spectacle of grand scenical display so vast
                     in the intricacy and incomprehensibility of its plot that the instructed mind
                     readily and cheerfully pronounces it to be that which it really is—the marvel
                     of all marvels—a marvel such that the dramas of Shakspeare are not so much in
                     comparison with it as are the paper puppets, made to dance by the itinerant
                     showman, in comparison with the greatest celebrities who have trod theatrical
                     boards in New York, Paris, or London:—such being something of the nature of the
                     marvelous phenomena attendant upon the interests of the Almighty and his
                     creatures in life and death, it appears to be the better way to treat those
                     final arguments of De Quincey's as taken in conjunction. Thus I shall consider
                     them.
                  The mystery of death is both solemn and sad. It is so because all we actually
                     know, and all we can actually know until our final day, concerning its hidden
                     elusions is what we may learn with the exercise of our fallible human reason.
                     English sod, unless the doctors have accepted his bequest of his body, may rest
                     on the bones of English De Quincey; can that Life, that
                        once divine Genius 
                        whch
                        which
                      once gave such vivid and wonderful power to his pen have ever been
                     coffined and earth-covered? In the reasonable light of what I have already
                     written can this be allowed? Mystery of death! Shall I say "his fate is
                     sealed," never more to be opened, neither for himself nor for any? Shall I
                     allow this to be the solution? Thus he bids me. But thus do I not accept his
                     behest. Rather, I shall say his fate is achieved, even though I
                     acknowledge my belief that his moral perverseness may have entailed upon him an
                     eternity of misery. And, however grief-harrowing the contemplation, still,
                     eternal misery must be better than annihilation—because, a soul in ruins must
                     be a grand as well as an awful thing to look upon, both to itself and to
                     others. Some poet reaching far into the mysteries of Eternity has finely said:— 
                        
                           "You may break, you may ruin the vase if you will,
                           But the scent of the rose will hang round it still."
                        
                     
                  
                  But what! the soul—Thought, actually and absolutely, die? No! no!
                     oh no, not that; better eternities of suffering.
                  How many are baffled with the term—generation. All have been. No one has ever
                     fathomed the source of Life and Intelligence—God. Has not mind always existed?
                     Has there ever been an original conception of Intelligence in conjunction with
                     the conception of the physical parts of man?
                  Shall De Quincey be allowed to claim this, as he does by implication, and hence
                     broadly and fearlessly hint that this principle in you, in me, and in the dumb
                     animal is perishable! For anything that can really be born, must perish,
                     according to the common acceptance of the term. If it be finite at one end it
                     must be finite also at the other. The body of man is born and perishes—perishes in so far as its physical
                     resemblance to the species of animal called man, is concerned. We know that
                     there have been curious and wonderful arts born into the world, which are now
                     lost—dead—dead to the world. But are they dead really? Are they dead in the
                     spiritual kingdom? Are they any more dead than is the matter which has once
                     existed in the form called man? That matter we know still exists in other
                     forms, and is yet a part of the great Universe. It is not really dead. Is it
                     not the same with those ideas which composed the Soul of the lost Arts? Are
                     they not now again locked up in the secrets of the one great Original Mind as
                     we may suppose them to have been before their original discovery by man?
                  Can anything die? Can the wonderful 
                        princple
                        principle
                      which raises you to your feet, puts you in motion, and keeps you
                     going, ever really die? That is all by and in which you, or I, or any one, or
                     any Power, or Intelligence, lives; perish that! perish God! Do you
                     doubt it?
                  Explain to me that the soul of man is conceived at the time when conception in
                     the womb first gives shape and form to his physical parts and I will then give
                     to De Quincey the affirmation of his argument, subscribing to the doctrine of
                     annihilation—annihilation of God and everything.
                  Grant, as I believe, and as you must, that God, Omnipotence, is
                     Will—that nothing can generate intellect but one supreme Intelligent Will—that
                     this Will does generate all things of a spiritual nature; and hence,
                        being dominant over everything, as in reason you well know it
                        is, can be the only seed or Source of generation for the principle of
                     Life in any of its many phases—then was the conception of man's Intelligence,
                     of every man's, lying latent in this Will in and from the beginning before the
                     Earth, even in that incomprehensible beginning which never was, but which,
                     nevertheless, always has been and always is, and can never
                        end—Will, the Will being always sufficient to itself; and
                     therefore no living thing can ever die. Why? is it yet questioned? Because, as
                     I have just explained, the deathless divinity which blows the breath from your
                     nostrils has a parentage in God, the Eternal.*
                     
                  
                  
                     *There is, in truth, no such thing as finite, as death. It is, really, but
                        a stage of procedure in the Infinite.
                  
                  There you have the confirmation double, both antecedent and consequent.
                  Whatever we may allow to stand, of that which precedes, the closing lines in De
                     Quincey's Barbara Lewthwaite should never have been written.
                  Much better and simpler is it, and much more readily can we believe it to be
                     truth, that that which caused the little Barbara in Wordsworth's exquisite poem
                     to pertinaciously reiterate "We are seven," was her instinctive or intuitive
                     perception of God in man—of course love and education had awakened and expanded
                     those perceptions—than that it was an obstinate adherence to a customary
                     precept taught by a parent, and whose foundation for support existed for her
                        but in her love for that parent.
                  The time of my first reading of Wordsworth's beautiful little poem—"We are
                     Seven"—stands for me an oasis in life as fresh and green, as fair and smiling
                     as can the glad reality of a first love in any young maiden's sweet, pure
                     heart. I was then only about ten years old, just at the age to receive
                     impressions kindly and entertain them earnestly. The impressions I then
                     received in my mind on first reading the poem, remain as indellibly, as
                     vividly, and as holily transcribed as though they were accepted there as a
                     precious bequest but yesterday. My ruling thought then with regard to little
                     Barbara—and I can assure my reader, if necessary, that, whatever I may now be
                     at twenty-one, I was not then an expert at unraveling the tangled wickednesses
                     of men—my ruling thought then, was, that, little Barbara did believe her
                     brother and sister to be dead—i.e.: dead to the inhabitants of the earth
                     according to the common acceptance of the term, and that she did
                        not anticipate meeting them again until she should join them
                     where they lived in Heaven. And as auxiliary to the proper
                     unfolding of my process of reasoning I will confess that the beauty of the
                     sentiment of the poem was somewhat obscured in my young, sympathetic
                     estimation, in that her interlocutor, by urging his persistent questions so
                     long on the attention of the innocent little maiden, appeared as somewhat
                     ogreish in my eyes by the time I had reached the close; though of course the
                     understanding of maturer years sanctions Wordsworth's repetitions of his
                     questions as fitting to the development of beauty and harmony in the poem. I
                     was impressed with the conviction
                     that she felt, in which I sympathized with her, that he comprehended her
                     meaning from the first, and knew beforehand, perfectly, of that of which he was
                     asking, and hence, as a gentleman, ought to have desisted from his inquiries.
                     However, despite the slight disagreeableness of the tall persecutor, I have
                     always shrined the poem and the little Barbara in my heart as some of its
                     first, dearest loves; and I can no more forgive the ruthless Thomas De Quincey
                     the outrage he has attempted in endeavoring to invade and destroy her sweet,
                     pure personality than I could forgive you if you should attempt to destroy the
                     palladium of American Liberty. And what is still more wretched, he meditated
                     the same atrocious barbarity—the same crime, toward his own little infant
                     daughter, linking her fate with that of the bird and with that of that same
                     little Barbara after she was grown to be a woman.
                  How much more charitable to the human family is it, and how much more
                     consistent it is with our reasonable notions of the Divine Goodness and
                     Greatness and with the innate teachings of our own souls to the same purpose,
                     that each of us holds within his being or corporate frame a deathless Life—how
                     much more charitable would it have been in De Quincey had he
                        inferred that the grief of his child arose from her accepting
                     the fact that she was but just separated from that which she had learned to
                     love intensely as a cherished pet, and which for a few brief hours—but sweet,
                     long hours to her—had filled her young life with a melodious happiness, than to
                        suppose that her soul mourned in fearful, dreary desolation the
                        absolute destruction of a life as recognized by her intuitions
                     or her reason.
                  The bird was probably the first thing of life the child had ever possessed, to
                     call her own. Beautifully, wonderfully, and fearfully formed, as are all things
                     of the Animated Creation; wounded and dependent, there is no cause for
                     astonishment that it excited the strong love and sympathy of what was,
                     probably, such as should have been the daughter of De Quincey, a delicately,
                     finely organized young female child; and that its, to her, sudden loss should
                     flood her young heart with a mighty sorrow. There should be cause for
                     astonishment if thus early in life the young thing had commenced to speculate
                     on its fate.
                  If true, De Quincey's assumption that infancy stands nearest to the great
                     realities of the Infinite*
                     —explaining Infinite either as the Deity or as one of the essentials or
                     attributes—instead of assisting to substantiate his own point, only aids the
                     opposite. It is but another argument, of which many millions may be adduced
                     from constant daily natural revelations, as well as from intellectual Sources,
                     that Intelligence of any kind is indestructible. The fact that man during any
                     stage of his earthly existence occupies, as De Quincey allows, a position in
                     close juxtaposition, relatively, to Infinity, proves that there is an Infinity
                     or a God, and that he can never lose its memory. It is with man in this case as
                     it is with the division of the atom: though divided forever it can never be
                     destroyed. However far man may recede from God—however dim his remembrance of
                     his Goodness and Greatness may become, he can never lose that memory entirely,
                     after he has once enjoyed it.
                  
                     *It does stand nearest by reason of its superior purity or innocence. And
                        Death may reveal to the wicked the splendors of heaven as insufferably
                        near—insufferably near by reason of their inability to partake in
                        enjoyment. N. S. R. B.
                  
                  Hence, in the light of De Quincey's own assumption, the lesson conveyed in
                     Wordsworth's divine little poem, "We are Seven," is great,
                     clear, and strong. The arch-plotter foils himself with his own language.
                  Again:—The testimony offered by Wordsworth is clear and conclusive, and
                     establishes his position completely. Wordsworth tells us the actually uttered,
                     truthful thoughts of an artless, innocent child; De Quincey's assertion that
                     all children who have arrived to the age of five years, or thereabouts, are
                     filled with untruth and the devil, to the contrary notwithstanding. De Quincey
                     gives us but the surmise of his own imagination on beholding Barbara, the
                     woman, and his infant daughter shed tears in witness of a song-bird's falling
                     back lifeless from a vain effort to accomplish its soaring aspirations.
                  Now, it is as easy for me to apprehend, that, at the instant the inert body of
                     the bird commenced to follow the laws of gravitation, the spirit of that bird
                     had attained the climax of its desires and was then freely soaring away upward
                     to the fields of everlasting light and life—this is as simple, natural, and
                     reasonable for you and me to apprehend, as, on the other hand, it could have
                     been rational for De Quincey to feel
                     that the "bird's fate was sealed;" which unmistakably implies—considered in
                     connection with what precedes—that he felt that a life was
                     entirely and utterly lost within those few memorable moments in
                     the garden—lost both to Earth and to Eternity—to Heaven and to Hell; not lost
                     by reason of impossibility of redemption from sin—nor lost by reason of denying
                     the brute or the bird an individuality or a personality (or a brutality or
                     birdality, to coin a word) of its own, because the sense of his Barbara
                        Lewthwaite clearly ranks the feathered songster in the human
                     category in so far as Eternity and soul are related to the subject—but lost as
                     being annihilated.
                  What more beautiful than that at the instant the bird had grandly poised itself
                     to swell its throat with the responsive song, that effort of attempting to sing
                     should shoot its soul forth and up, clear and free, leaving the inert body of
                     lifeless clay to return according to natural laws to its natural
                     affinities.
                  Whatever De Quincey may have felt, I can feel that that bird which
                     he, and the woman and child as he felt, interpreted to have made a vain effort
                     to answer one of its kind, did sing, and then and there, and is
                     still singing, and will yet sing, forevermore.
                  God pity! I say, Thomas De Quincey for the attempt to betray her in her
                     witnessings to the Spirit of God speaking within her, Barbara
                        Lewthwaite, woman.
                  God bless William Wordsworth for embalming within our Literature, sweet,
                     pleasant, divine memories of Barbara Lewthwaite, the child.

                  NOTE.—Mr. Dimond's essay was prepared without his having read those essays of
                     Mr. De Quincey which are more strictly theological in character. Whether
                     reading those discussions of Mr. De Q.'s would have changed or modified his
                     views, cannot, of course, now be said.

               VII.
               SOMETHING FOUND BY DEWITT AMONG THE PENINSULAR PINES.
               
                  I.
                  TIME: eight o'clock in the evening, October 21, 18—. Place: a roomy log pen
                     adjacent to a commodious log house of considerable pretensions, situated near
                     the C—river, whose winey waters, drained from the extensive pine and hemlock
                     forests of Northern Michigan, flow, a strong and healthful flood into the great
                     lake called Huron. And contiguous to the log pen, on the side
                     opposite to the pretentious house of logs, seen through the smooth, columnar
                     bolls of the tall pines, along the edge of a clearing well encumbered with
                     stumps, a humbler hut of logs belonging to another estate than that on which
                     the first two rude enclosures have been erected.
                  Persons: a brother and sister pursuing their busy occupation of making and
                     bunching shingles, an employment engaged in by hundreds of the ever busy,
                     active inhabitants of the peninsular State.
                  In this instance the operation is performed by the light of the brilliant flame
                     springing from a fire of pine shavings burning in the center of the square pen,
                     and which is kept replenished by the girl, from time to time, as needed, who,
                     with a light, long handled wooden fork tosses on the feathery fuel which the
                     brother cuts with marvelous rapidity, using his draw shave
                     dextrously and masterly, from the battalions of little pine planks standing in
                     military rows at his left side, just as the froe has left them rived, but not
                     yet completely separated in the block.
                  
                  The doorway at the south side of the structure being unguarded by door or
                     curtain of any kind, you may, while passing, look in without hindrance, and
                     note how faithfully the two are laboring. When they commenced work in the early
                     evening, after having eaten their supper—a delicious meal previously prepared
                     by the sister—all one great corner of the pen was filled with loose shingles
                     which the busy brother had dressed, trimmed, and cast lightly from him to sail
                     in there on the air one at a time.
                  Since that time, the girl, with wondrous nimble hands and wondrous quick
                     judgment and eye to decide on proper lengths for fits, has deftly bunched them,
                     points overlapping, with remarkable rapidity, calling out musically and with a
                     bright smile on her face as she completes counting up the requisite number of
                     "courses":—
                  "Ready!"
                  At the word, up springs the brother with alacrity, lays down his shaving knife,
                     swings off from astraddle of his "horse," crosses over with three or four
                     strides to the newly packed bunch, lying up high and flaky, flings on the ready
                     prepared confining capping bar, lowers his lever and throws a leg over the long
                     arm, thus bringing his weight to crush the bunch down to nearly proper
                     dimensions, drives his wedges and the cap in half a minute, thereby gaining the
                     remainder of the needed compression, throws off the lever, rolls the compacted,
                     shapely bunch into storage, and returns to his "horse" again.
                  Thus they have labored from before dark until it is now nearly half-past eight
                     o'clock, the girl rapidly lowering the great pile in the corner, although the
                     fall of shingles, shied constantly on by the brother has been something like
                     what I imagine a shower of palm leaves from the parent tree may be in a
                     freshening breeze.
                  At half-past eight o'clock the girl has found the bottom of the pile and now
                     sits looking musingly into the glowing fire whose shifting lights shooting
                     through the doorway of the assemblage of logs play fantastic tricks in the
                     night outside.
                  She sits and muses half-abstractedly; her thoughts on this evening having a
                     subject on which to dwell that is new to them and which she has allowed to stay
                     in her mind, and has dwelt upon it there until it has become exceedingly
                     interesting to her. She has had so little of novelty in her wilderness life to
                     engage her thoughts that this need not be particularly wondered at, although
                     the subject as it relates to her at this stage of her life may as yet appear to
                     the reader, when he learns it, as being of an ordinary character.
                  But though pretty deeply engrossed with her theme, the occasional remark she
                     addresses to her companion indicates that she has not yet become subject to
                     those completely entrancing, dreamy speculations which so often absorb and sway
                     the mind of the innocent maturing maiden to the exclusion of all besides. Her
                     dreams have as yet only hovered around the borders of the Maiden's Fairy Land.
                     She has been, perhaps, where she could look in, but her heart has never yet
                     explored in the enchanted realm. Of this you shall have proof in her speech so
                     soon as I have taken advantage of her accomplished labor, which leaves her at
                     her ease and in fit condition to be studied, to indicate something of her
                        personelle.
                  She is a fine picture—a lovely picture, as she sits in repose, a state that
                     becomes her exceedingly well, alternately regarding the fire, and again the
                     shingle maker, who so quickly seizes the little shingle board in the rough in
                     his left hand, dextrously catches it in the vise on the "horse" in front of
                     him, polishes the flat surface into an inclined plane with two or three long,
                     smooth, even, quick cuts of his sharp, two-handled knife, gives another cut,
                     evenly and deftly drawn on the extent of the inner edge; turns it over and
                     catches it again in half an instant with the bite of the vise; two or three
                     more long, smooth, even cuts, then another on the other edge, and away it
                     flies, and he has caught up one of its mates to undergo the same operation,
                     soon as you have read the description.
                  The girl sits and regards the brother's movements for several minutes, half
                     dreamily, a slight shade of pensiveness beginning to blend with the native
                     radiance of her countenance; but though apparently engrossed with the expert
                     manœuvres of shingle making, it is not, as I have intimated, that which fills
                     her mind. She has bunched so many shingles and has seen so many made, that
                     shingle making and its accessories is become like an old story to her.
                  
                  That which she is now revolving so diligently in her mind, curious to
                     understand, but which for a very good reason it is impossible for her to know
                     just at present, and about which she knows not whether to be pleased, relates
                     to an interesting piece of news that has transpired within the day or two last
                     past.
                  You can readily perceive that the effort to imagine and surmount what is as yet
                     half a mystery to her lends to the fair, white, glowing, and attractive face,
                     the additional attraction of slight pensiveness that is so very becoming in the
                     appearance of almost any young maiden when it visits her. You can also readily
                     imagine from that look that there must be a genuine heart inside the person to
                     impart a tone of feeling to the countenance on fitting occasions. And there is;
                     and in the present instance it soon discovers itself.
                  First, however, before allowing the fair girl to show her heart to you, or any
                     portion thereof, I shall, in order to make my description more nearly complete,
                     and to bring the principal headings of the story properly in, recede a little,
                     and commence again: thus:—
                  What more pleasing to the appreciative young man anywhere in his twenties than
                     to behold, unobserved, an innocent, pure young girl who is in her last teens;
                     whose proportions of form are faultless; whose complexion is fair, pure and
                     healthy; whose disposition is always sweet and of the most hopeful; whose
                     handsome features are always buoyant and radiant with her pure, happy
                     aspirations; whose eyes are always laughing hope, and joy, and love—what more
                     pleasing to the young man than to see just such a young girl—just such a joyous
                     nature when it is just slightly awed, or subdued, by any innocent, attractive
                     puzzle that it cannot solve? Nothing! It tinges her redundant joyousness of
                     soul with that delicate, engaging shade of pensiveness which renders it
                     inexpressibly and deliciously sweet and attractive.
                  This was just the appearance of Annette Vinton while she sat watching the bold
                     flame, mellow and liquid at the base of the cone, darkening as it ascended,
                     until finally, surmounted by a mitred canopy of lurid black, it rose
                     irresistibly up and rolled a heavy volume of heat and cloudy gases out at the
                     square, wide opening in the roof of the pen; and anon, her brother, whose
                     shingles flew from him thick and fast, like little kites into the corner.
                  This was her appearance; an attitude so graceful—so instinct with purity and
                     intelligence, and with youth, health, and lithe, refined vigor—a countenance
                     and manner so attractive that her coarse dress of faded calico could not
                     detract from her charms. While contemplating the almost matchless loveliness of
                     the woman you would be sure to forget in regard to the dress which draped her
                     person.
                  She sat thus for some minutes, regarding her brother and the pyramid of
                     ascending flame, mechanically, her peculiar train of thought momently deepening
                     the beautiful attractiveness of her air as her inability to solve her problem
                     became apparent to her understanding, until, suddenly, the absurdity of
                     attempting to explore the impossible urging itself upon her perceptions, her
                     thoughts opened into a low musical laugh, which immediately chased all the
                     engaging pensiveness—but not by any means all the attractiveness, away, and
                     revealed to her brother something of her state of mind.
                  He glanced at her quickly, inquiring:—
                  "What is it 'Nettie?"
                  'Nettie laughed still, low and musically, replying with a question in
                     turn:—
                  "What do you suppose he is like, Leonard?"
                  "Who?"
                  "Why, this Mr. Dewitt C. Dimond who is coming from York State to visit his
                     uncle, aunt, and cousins up here in the Michigan woods."
                  "O! you are thinking of him are you? Very likely he is very much like his
                     cousins, Thomas and Henry."
               
               
                  II.
                  Now the brother and sister were not aware of his close proximity to themselves;
                     but I will confidentially inform you that that identical "young hopeful,"
                     Dewitt C., whom I have already introduced to you as Bluff-'Em-Off
                     in his cousin Bascom's story, when he was younger than now, had
                     just arrived from the stage road some twenty miles distant, where he had debarked from the accommodating
                     coach about noon. He had since walked the twenty miles along the pine ridges,
                     half the distance by a "blazed" path, and was now standing in the shadows
                     outside the shingle pen, and had there been standing for the past quarter of an
                     hour, so completely absorbed contemplating the female loveliness which I have
                     extolled none too highly, that he appeared as if chained in a mesmeric
                     spell.
                  And should you not think he well might so appear; particularly as the discovery
                     of such a piquant, beautiful piece of perfection in those wilds, and more than
                     all, in such a situation, was a complete surprise to him? I think so; and that
                     is also the truth of the matter. He was surprised; he was fascinated,
                     spell-bound, conquered, by the charms which had burst so suddenly upon his view
                     in a place where he had anticipated discovering little beside bears and
                     wolves.
                  I may as well tell you now as any other time that cupid sent a shaft straight
                     through his heart when he first came up and first beheld the lovable picture,
                     just as Annette was completing the packing of her last bunch of shingles—that,
                     hesitating to advance at once, her subsequent reverie caught him and imposed
                     upon him a soft spell, of which the cunning and cruel little god took advantage
                     to bind him hand and foot; and then, while the after conversation progressed,
                     catching from his always ready quiver one of his best, honey-tipped darts,
                     pierced his heart so through and through that he lacerated it with a million
                     delicious pains, from the ecstasies of which the young Dewitt could not escape
                     and give token of his presence until the brother and sister had conversed
                     together for some time.
                  I excuse him of the crime of eavesdropping. He could not have stirred had he
                     tried. It was a veritable case of love at first sight.
                  But still, though so quickly subdued, you should not infer that the young man
                     surrendered against all reason and judgment, for he did not. Like all the
                     Dimond family, Dewitt's instincts and intuitions were usually unerring; and
                     hence, like other members of the family he was accustomed to judge of
                     character, and judge correctly too, on brief acquaintance. Though they usually
                     waited for time to confirm the choice made by quick judgment, before they
                     committed themselves with demonstration, yet within their own consciousness
                     they often chose, and worthily too, their friendships and their loves at a
                     glance. And besides, like the Dimonds, Dewitt looked more to heart
                     than to anything else in the selection of friends; some of the family required
                     the embellishments of education and superior mental strength to be resident in
                     the objects of their choice, but none of them esteemed the gauds and trappings
                     of wealth as being possessed of any particular intrinsic value. Provided the
                     other requisites were forthcoming any Dimond would have dispensed with the
                     last; else he would have been no true Dimond, and would not have been
                     acknowledged by the family.
                  Hence, if you had been there at the time, and had asked Dewitt how it could be
                     that he could admire so suddenly and profoundly, the girl sitting there in the
                     shingle pen, covered only with her worn and faded old dress, he might, and
                     probably would, if he had answered at all, have answered you proudly and
                     haughtily:—
                  "I have discovered that she has the soul of a lady, and if she belonged to me I
                     could buy her the dresses."
                  Meanwhile, while Dewitt's emotional system is quivering for the first time with
                     those nameless, unexplainable thrills of pleasure such as can be excited in any
                     bosom only by a person of the opposite sex, that conversation which I have
                     already explained as being the power to swell those thrills into complete
                     volume and to complete his enthrallment, progresses between the brother and
                     sister.
                  Responsive to her brother's last answer, Annette continues:—
                  "Yes, I suppose he looks something like them; but I mean—what do you suppose
                     his disposition—his character is?—what do you suppose he thinks about? I wonder
                     if he will feel above folks that live in the woods and make shingles? Jane says
                     his folks down in York own a great deal of land and are very grand for farming
                     people."
                  "Well! what if they are! We are as good as they, likely; and if not, what could
                     it be to us?"
                  Leonard eyed his sister sharply, continuing: a touch of rebuke in his
                     tone:—
                  "'Nettie! what are you thinking about?"
                  The girl laughed softly, replying easily enough:—
                  "O nothing! Only I suppose I shall see him; and it's natural to try to imagine
                     what the cousin of one's friend is like."
                  
                  "Yes! Well! But don't imagine too much before you have cause."
                  "Leonard!" There was more than a tinge of grief in the young girl's voice and
                     eyes; the great joyousness of her nature was dimmed for the moment:—
                  "Leonard! can you think so illy of me?"
                  Leonard perceived his mistake; he felt rebuked; he got off his "horse" and went
                     and kissed his sister:—
                  "No! no! 'Nettie. I think my love for you must have destroyed both my delicacy
                     and discretion, for the moment. You know you and I and father are here all
                     alone from dear Old England."
                  Just here is where the ever busy, meddling little Love god completed his
                     conquest over Dewitt. The young man, still standing out in the shadows, said to
                     himself with great emphasis:—
                  "I'll have that girl, sure, if I can get her."
                  Their conversation had confirmed his intuitions and made him happy.
                  Said 'Nettie:—
                  "Thank you, Leonard! I don't think you meant to hurt me," then reverting to
                     another branch of the subject:—"His last letter to Thomas says they may expect
                     him now in two or three days, doesn't it?"
                  "Yes!"
                  "At two cents a bunch I have now five dollars due me for bunching shingles. It
                     is enough to buy me a good many things. Don't you think Thomas will let you
                     take the horses and take a load of shingles down to 'The Mills' to-morrow?"
                  Annette glanced inquiringly to her brother and then deprecatingly at the faded
                     old dress of calico which covered her shapely proportions.
                  Leonard kindly replied:—
                  "Yes, 'Nettie! I think he will. I'll run over and ask him very early in the
                     morning."
                  "And then I can easily make me a dress the next day."
                  "Yes, you shall have it if I can get it," cordially responded the brother,
                     continuing, while Dewitt walked softly away from the pen a proper distance, and
                     then came tramping heavily up with plenty of necessary noise:—
                  "You might go with me to 'The Mills' and select your dress yourself."
                  "No! I can tell you near enough, and father needs me at home. You know what a
                     pretty piece of calico you brought for my bonnet the last time you went. You
                     are to be trusted," concluded she good-humoredly. Then said she again quickly,
                     and almost inaudibly.
                  "Hark!"
                  The next moment Dewitt entered the doorway:—
                  "Good evening!" said he, with assumed nonchalance.
                  "Good evening!" corresponded Leonard.
                  "Can you direct me to the residence of Mr. Dimond?"
                  Leonard, stepping to the doorway in which the tall and elegant Dewitt was
                     standing, directed his eyes through the gloom along the sandy roadway in the
                     direction of the pretentious log house:—
                  "Yes, you are now on his premises. You have to pursue the way you have come
                     only some thirty rods further and you will arrive at his house. You are the
                     nephew he expects, I presume."
                  "Yes, I am Dewitt C. Dimond; and you?"
                  "Leonard Vinton!"
                  "Yes, I hardly thought you could be one of my cousins; not the Dimond features.
                     You are, doubtless, a friend of theirs?"
                  "Yes, we are friends."
                  Leonard turned to his sister, continuing:—
                  "My sister, Miss Vinton, Mr. Dimond."
                  "Miss Vinton, I am very much pleased to make your acquaintance," said Dewitt
                     with a certain speaking emphasis of manner of which he was unconscious,
                     verifying his words.
                  The girl's laughing eyes glowed; his manner touched her refined feminine
                     instincts happily, causing a pleasurable sympathetic thrill, she believed in
                     him instantly as he had in her; she liked him.
                  It was with her just as it was with Lucy V. C—s when she first heard Will
                     Dimond speak at the boat landing in Detroit.
                  She said simply and naturally:—
                  "The pleasure is mutual, sir."
                  "You are a shingle maker, are you. I didn't know that girls were in the shingle
                     business."
                  The hypocrite! He hadn't watched her complete the packing of her last bunch,
                     had he?
                  
                  Annette laughed, amused:—
                  "O no! girls don't make shingles here, whatever they may do elsewhere. I only
                     pack them into bunches."
                  "Does cousin Jane do such work?"
                  "Seldom, and never, unless she comes to visit with me."
                  "Does the employment suit you?"
                  "Yes, pretty well. I have bunched all Leonard has shaved for two years past and
                     have not tired yet."
                  "Can you pack them as fast as your brother can make them?"
                  "O yes, four times faster. But I couldn't when I first commenced. What a time
                     father and I had then!"
                  She laughed the long, low, becoming musical laugh of melody that Dewitt had
                     heard once before that evening.
                  He looked unmistakable admiration and interest as he queried:—
                  "What was it? Tell me, please!"
                  Without attempting evasion or asking for indulgence or excuse, Annette
                     commenced:—
                  "We had just arrived in the vicinity. Your cousin Thomas had a large pile of
                     shingles already made and lying loose in this pen. He wanted them made into
                     bunches immediately, the pile being so large they were getting in his way; and
                     he and Henry desired much to busy themselves about something else. Under the
                     circumstances he applied to father as the likeliest, in fact, as the only help
                     he could get to take his place. We wanted the work as much as anybody could
                     want it. Father, therefore, unhesitatingly took the job, and thinking so simple
                     an operation as bunching shingles could require no explanation, he asked for
                     none. This was in the evening. So the next morning we armed ourselves, each
                     with a sharp case-knife, and marched in Indian military array, much elated,
                     through the smooth-stemmed pines to this pen."
                  The young men laughed in unison. Dewitt asked with laudable
                     inquisitiveness:—
                  "What were the case-knives for?"
                  Annette proceeded:—
                  "Wait, and you'll soon learn. We marched from our little cabin—or rather Mr.
                     Dimond's, in high spirits. Arrived here, we commenced without delay. Using our
                     case-knives with skill and effect, we fitted every course in the first bunch so
                     perfectly that you could have driven a pin through a shingle in any place
                     nearly as easily as between joints; and so all day. The builder who bought
                     those shingles got good measure."
                  Annette went through her recital with spirit and piquancy, completely charming
                     her willing listener. He liked the music of her voice and the witching grace of
                     her manner so well he would not think of his uncle's; so, to prolong the
                     conversation and keep the charmer near him, he inquired eagerly before they had
                     ceased to laugh over the little anecdote:—
                  "How much did you earn the first day?"
                  "Just six cents apiece. It took so much time to trim a shingle for nearly every
                     course, and so long for father, who was entirely inexperienced, to drive and
                     wedge down the cap pieces, that we got together only six bunches on the first
                     day."
                  They all laughed again; Dewitt continuing:—
                  "How well was Tom satisfied?"
                  "O! after father had informed him of our methods of procedure he said he
                     thought we had done pretty well, 'considering.'"
                  She emphasized the last word in that peculiar way in which it is often used in
                     similar significance in the country.
                  "You completed the job?"
                  Annette appeared a little surprised to hear the question; also Leonard; and it
                     was the latter who answered, pride and dignity blended in his tone and
                     air:—
                  "An Englishman completes all he undertakes; unless, indeed, his labor does not
                     lie within the possibilities of accomplishment, or unless he does not commence
                     with the intent to complete."
                  Leonard, also, beginning to think that Dewitt was manifesting much more
                     inclination to stay in the presence of 'Nettie than to continue his route to
                     his uncle's, now reminded her, who had also been getting pretty well pleased
                     with her situation during the past few minutes:—
                  "'Nettie, it must be past the time you usually make father's evening cup of
                     tea. You'll excuse her, Mr. Dimond?"
                  "Certainly! Certainly!" said Dewitt, "I had no thought I was detaining her from
                     a duty. And truly," continued he, pulling forth his repeater and glancing at
                     the dial, "Uncle Israel's folks will
                     be abed before I can get to their house, unless I am expeditious. It is past
                     nine o'clock. Good night, Miss Vinton! I may come and see you bunch shingles
                     to-morrow, may I not?"
                  "I should be happy to have you, but I shall not bunch shingles to-morrow. Good
                     night, sir!"
                  "Well! but," persisted Dewitt, "some other time then?"
                  "O!" conceded she, archly, "you shall be welcome the first time you can catch
                     me here."
                  What a subtle thing is a girl's heart to sometimes divine the heart of her
                     lover. Already she suspected him.
                  And away Annette Vinton tripped in her faded calico, in among the tall
                     evergreen pines—away she tripped, more gracefully, and with a lighter, happier
                     heart than most of the fair, graceful girls in Michigan who were wearing silks
                     on that October evening.
                  Her nature was naturally very sunny and joyous, and to-night she had
                     tasted—ever so slightly—but she had tasted for the first time of the witcheries
                     and charms with which "Love's young dream" invests the heart of the maid in her
                     teens.
                  "Good night, Mr. Vinton," and Dewitt pursued his way to his uncle's.
                  "Good night, Mr. Dimond," and Leonard ran to overtake his sister, who was now
                     some thirty yards in advance, on the way to their humble little house of
                     logs.
                  There was some pleasant musing indulged in before two of the young people slept
                     that night.
               
               
                  III.
                  Mr. Vinton, the father of Leonard and Annette, was the second son of a poor
                     English curate who had flourished in the South of England. Not feeling called
                     to follow in the footsteps of his father in the ministry, the son had adopted
                     the profession of farming at his commencement in life. After his marriage,
                     which occurred at this time, he pursued the calling diligently, as a gentleman,
                     for about fifteen years. His success was but indifferent. Like so many of the
                     poorer of the English gentry who seek to gain a livelihood without using their
                     hands, his means did not increase.
                  After his unsuccessful experiment of fifteen years his thoughts became turned
                     to the New World. Thinking to do better in America he accordingly came hither.
                     Landing safely on our fertile shores at New York, he had wandered thence with
                     his family, almost aimlessly, to the vicinity of Ann Arbor in Michigan. Here,
                     on the strength of his honest looks and being an Englishman, he succeeded in
                     leasing a small farm for three years on advantageous terms. And here he had
                     gone to work with a will in company with his son Leonard, and was doing very
                     well, when he became acquainted with Israel Dimond, then also pursuing his
                     calling of farming and maintaining a son in the University, who was now about
                     graduating.
                  Mr. Dimond, though not wealthy, could, like many another American father of
                     circumscribed fortune, sustain a son in college. He was, in fact, but little
                     better situated pecuniarily than was Mr. Vinton; his efforts to rise in the
                     world since leaving the old home estate in New York not having been blessed
                     with the best of success.
                  Similarity of fortune, of temperament, and of tastes, attracting the American
                     and the Englishman together, they became warm friends soon after their first
                     meeting, and so when—his son having left college, and no longer needed a home
                     under his father's roof—Mr. Dimond decided to purchase and remove to some very
                     good lands among the pineries in Northern Michigan, in T—*
                      county, that were then being sold under the designation of "swamp lands," at the merely nominal price of a shilling an acre,
                     he warmly and strongly urged Mr. Vinton to accompany him. But Mr. Vinton having
                     yet two years of his lease to enjoy deemed it to be to his best interests to
                     stay where he was for the present, though he thought he might very soon visit
                     T— county—so soon as he should be more at liberty from farm labors, which were
                     at present driving him and his son—in order to purchase a place for the
                     future.
                  
                     *The reader is not to infer that I use in this story the initial that is
                        genuine with county, river, place or town, &c. I merely adopt the
                        letter that occurs most readily and is most convenient to my mind.
                  
                  Mr. Dimond therefore proceeded alone with his family to the pineries, Mr.
                     Vinton promising to follow so soon as his farm labors should release him, and
                     secure some of the cheap lands; and to remove there at the expiration of his
                     lease.
                  
                  Hence at the expiration of about a month's time after Mr. Dimond's removal, Mr.
                     Vinton went up to T— county, thinking to secure some land in his friend's
                     vicinity; but then he was too late, the lands having all been greedily seized
                     by speculators, except such as were secured by other more useful men like Mr.
                     Dimond and Mr. Vinton, so soon as it became generally known they could be had
                     at so cheap a rate.
                  Mr. Vinton was obliged, therefore, to return to Ann Arbor disappointed, but not
                     disheartened; he designing to proceed again to Mr. Dimond's neighborhood and
                     "settle" at the expiration of the two years, when he hoped he should be able to
                     command means sufficient to purchase an "eighty."
                  He labored and waited until the two years were expired, during which interval
                     his wife sickened and died, leaving behind her only the youthful Annette to
                     attend to household cares. Then he removed to T— county, carrying with him
                     about $300 that he had acquired in his American farming operations. Now,
                     however, on arriving at his destination, he soon learned that land could not be
                     purchased near as advantageously as at his first visit.
                  Deciding therefore to await a favorable opportunity, the young Dimonds, Thomas
                     and Henry, and his own son threw up a comfortable log house on one corner of
                     Mr. Dimond's place, into which he entered, installing Annette as mistress. Here
                     he had remained for nearly two years, himself a good portion of the time, and
                     his son all the time, laboring faithfully for the Dimonds.
                  It was only about two weeks previous to Dewitt's advent that he had satisfied
                     himself with an "eighty" adjoining his friend's estate. This he had purchased,
                     had hastily erected upon it the convenient log house, and had but just removed
                     when Dewitt came.
                  The purchase of the "eighty" more than exhausting his means, and himself and
                     son not yet having completed preparations to commence for themselves, young
                     Vinton was yet at work for the Dimonds; and hence Dewitt had happily
                     encountered Annette, light-hearted and joyous as always, in her old calico
                     dress in the Dimond shingle-pen. One week later and she would have been
                     similarly situated in a pen of her father and Leonard's construction, located
                     off the highway, where he might not have found her so readily; and where, had
                     he found her, he might not have approached her in just the same
                     manner. Bear in mind that the circumstances pertaining to the first meeting
                     between two young persons of opposite sex sometimes have a great deal to do
                     with shaping their after conduct toward one another.
                  Late the next morning after Dewitt's arrival, he awoke in his uncle's
                     comfortable double house of logs, arose, and looked out of the window to see it
                     raining. The rain was falling easily and softly, but very steadily; soaking
                     everything penetrable, by reason of its ceaseless continuance, in a soggy,
                     clammy drench.
                  It was one of those rains, such as, in the fall or spring of the year, the
                     wayfarer dreads to encounter at a distance from shelter; soft and easy, but
                     unbearably cruel in its pitiless, searching persistency, falling, falling,
                     falling, incessantly, all day long, its insinuating approaches cannot be
                     evaded. It penetrates, ruthlessly, everywhere. Trickling at first, softly, like
                     little warm streams of mellow wine along the skin, it spreads slowly, sweetly,
                     and with genial warmth over all the person, steeping it at first in the luxury
                     of the delicious tepid bath, to grow gradually and almost imperceptibly cool,
                     cool, cooler; cold, cold, colder, and then freezing, until at last it seems as
                     if the chills of death were wrapping the body in frigid embrace. When caught
                     out in such a rain there is no escape from the great icy fingers which at last
                     creep around and seem to gripe the body in deathly clutch—no escape except in
                     vigorous motion; you cannot step from the enforced bath into dry air and rub
                     your person into glowing warmth with crash towels.
                  God pity the poor animal—for man does not, always—exposed to a twenty-four
                     hours' rain in spring or autumn. The sufferings it sometimes undergoes are
                     terrible; they may be, really, so far beyond the terrible as to be
                     nameless—exceeding any term that human knowledge can employ to express the
                     horrible.
                  Dewitt knew something about it. As soon as he arose and looked out of the
                     window he comprehended, though unused to long drives in a new country, that
                     there was little probability that Leonard would drive to "The Mills," wherever
                     that might be, with a load of shingles on that day. Thomas certainly would not permit his team out
                     in such a rain. He would understand its merciless insistency to numb, overpower
                     and subdue every living thing it might catch in its deadening embrace.
                  Quite good-humoredly, therefore, he congratulated himself that Annette would be
                     bunching shingles again at some time during the day, and that he should see her
                     again speedily. And carrying such a pleasant thought in his mind when he joined
                     his uncle's family, it was with a great deal of concealed impatience that he
                     restrained himself to quietly visit with them until after dinner.
                  Dinner ended, he excused himself almost immediately, and inviting Henry to
                     accompany him to keep up appearances, directed his steps to the pleasant place
                     where he had met the lovely girl on the previous evening.
                  Arrived at the shingle-pen they found Leonard alone smoothing shingles with his
                     handy draw-shave and whistling a merry stave. Missing Annette, Dewitt looked
                     with lugubrious countenance around on the smoky walls and at the dismal pile of
                     blackened ashes on the ground in the center of the old shell and felt his
                     errand to be bootless. Was it? No! not quite. Youth and young love are sanguine
                     and easily recover themselves. Leonard struck up a lively conversation at once,
                     into which the young lover soon joined, and in the course of an hour or so
                     managed to introduce an unsuspectable inquiry as to what the sister might be
                     employing herself about that she was not packing shingles.
                  "O!" said Leonard, "when we got up this morning she thought of an unaccountable
                     sight of work to be done in the house to-day, and she is staying at home to do
                     it I suppose."
                  The fact was, and I will impart it to the reader of any sex, the poor but happy
                     girl was exerting her most strenuous endeavors to beautify her slender and
                     impoverished wardrobe. And, alas! her task was also bootless, she having always
                     kept it at its best; nevertheless, the desperate extremity did not daunt her;
                     she accepted the facts cheerfully, and went about her work singing with a heart
                     as gay and blithe as it had been on the evening before. Neither storms of rain
                     nor of fortune could cast a gloom over her sunny soul to quench its native
                     joyousness. Do you wonder der if the sympathetic heart of the young Dewitt
                     became most thoroughly bewitched before he had been two weeks her acquaintance?
                     You need not.
                  Therefore, what did it signify if he did not find the enchantress bunching
                     shingles on this day? He hunted her out afterwards, of course, many and many a
                     time; and found her, too, after she had got her cheap new calico dress; and
                     discovered that its new, fresh brightness toned admirably well with her
                     brightness.
                  Often alone, and as often in company with cousin Jane, who had her private
                     reasons for sympathizing with both, and who saw how the tide was setting and
                     did sympathize, would he go over to Mr. Vinton's and spend long evenings in the
                     paradise that he and the English girl could create for themselves.
                  Sexual Affection is a beautiful—a glorious thing when it is pure
                     and sweet.
                  Very soon, within two weeks, it became that old story again—the old story that
                     you have heard and read so often, and yet which is always new whenever
                     told—love strong and deep, and succeeded by the usual engagement.
               
               
                  IV.
                  During the time—the many days that Dewitt was visiting at his uncle's, and
                     calling as often at Mr. Vinton's to enjoy the charming Annette's society, he
                     also went around a great deal in the thinly settled neighborhood, accompanied
                     usually by his cousins Thomas and Henry, or one of them. They journeyed around
                     a great deal, hunting in the woods and visiting places of interest, and calling
                     not infrequently at the village of V— a few miles distant.
                  At V— he often met a man for whom he soon conceived a strong dislike. This
                     man's name was Isaac Meacham. He soon learned to dislike Isaac Meacham as a
                     man, independently of any other considerations, though subsequent disclosures
                     coupled with subsequent conduct operated in a manner to very much intensify the
                     dislike.
                  After Dewitt had met Meacham two or three times at V— and had discovered his
                     repulsiveness to himself, he was so
                     unfortunate, or fortunate, as to encounter him on one or two evenings at Mr.
                     Vinton's, where his manner betokened a warm admiration for the lively and
                     interesting Annette. This was one of the causes which intensified Dewitt's
                     dislike, for, of course, the young New Yorker not liking the man at all would
                     still more dislike any attention he might be so bold as to bestow on the girl
                     of his choice.
                  These visits of Meacham's troubled Dewitt—they troubled him particularly
                     because he could not fail to perceive that they were made almost expressly on
                     Annette's account—they troubled him so much that he spoke to Annette about the
                     matter.
                  Though so early in their engagement, the understanding between the lovers was
                     already become so thorough that Annette dealt very frankly with him. She kept
                     nothing from him through prudery or any sense of false delicacy. She informed
                     him that she did not like the obnoxious personage at all—that she held a very
                     bad opinion concerning him almost the worst that a woman can harbor concerning
                     a man—that he had visited her father's house in the same manner for the past
                     two years—that she believed he had always come expressly to see her—but that
                     never having received the slightest encouragement from her, he had never
                     presumed to make any advances further than to regard her with warm glances and
                     to offer an occasional flattering compliment such as Dewitt had already
                     witnessed. Annette also informed Dewitt that, Meacham calling at all other
                     residences in the vicinity, occasionally and at his own option, to chat
                     familiarly with the heads of the families, as his character as chief lumberman
                     and extensive landowner in the county would seem to warrant him to do, it had
                     not been thought advisable by the Vintons to remark his calls; and
                     consequently, having received no direct repulses, she believed her poor
                     attractions had invited and insured the continuance of his undesired
                     visits.
                  This statement happily confirmed—as subsequent events disclose—Dewitt's growing
                     dislike to Meacham into a settled principle. He decided that the man was not to
                     be trusted; and when such men as the Dimonds decide that a man is untrustworthy
                     he must be "sharp" to overreach them. They do better than to withhold
                     confidence; if they possess anything precious, or of value, they place it in
                     watch and ward where such a man as Dewitt supposed Meacham to be, is concerned.
                     Annette had a better guardian than she yet knew—a better, even though Meacham
                     did overreach them both, for a little time, afterward.
                  As Annette had stated to her lover, Isaac Meacham was quite a power there in
                     the woods, in the T— county pineries. Master of considerable wealth, and
                     sending a large "drive" of pine logs down the C— river at every spring "fresh"
                     made him a person of considerable consequence in that county.
                  Employing those who desired labor, to cut and haul many logs on his own
                     property, and also purchasing many of the smaller proprietors, always paying
                     fair prices, he was regarded with favor by nearly all. Particularly the young
                     men, and more particularly those who are regarded as but a few steps above the
                     worthless, and who constituted a large fraction of the number of those whom he
                     employed to cut his own trees, respected him much as European vassals do their
                     lords.
                  Being also of good presence and yet young, only about thirty, he was also
                     regarded by the young femineity of those woods as a person whose attention was
                     not undesirable; always excepting Annette and one or two others who had read
                     his character.
                  But Annette, as with Dewitt, and as I have said, had, from the outset disliked
                     him; and not having faith in the man, the adventitious advantages of wealth and
                     power could not deceive her. She always seemed to discover under the smooth,
                     plausible exterior he carried about, a lurking insolence and profligacy that
                     were very repulsive to her pure instincts; and hence, though without exhibiting
                     a tithe of the repugnance she really felt, she had kept him at a distance.
                  She had read his character correctly. Meacham was a bold, bad man. He would not
                     have hesitated an instant in gaining her affections to the basest of ends.
                     Could he have won her rich young heart, to enjoy its purity and freshness for a
                     brief hour, and then carelessly and wantonly fling it aside as a useless toy,
                     he would have gloried in the deed.
                  This was really his desire; and all that had influenced him to hold his desires
                     in check thus far was his belief that no advances of any kind that he could
                     make would get any credit from her
                     or hers. Had he been a less intelligent man cherishing the same desires, his
                     conduct would have been such that it would have produced open rupture long ere
                     now. Still, though he had really despaired, he had never really relinquished
                     the pursuit. Annette Vinton was too lovely and too sweet a girl to be allowed
                     to go without a struggle on his part.
                  Therefore, when Dewitt stepped into the scene, serene in the strength of good
                     principles, prepared to claim and take the place of victor at once, and swept
                     across the circle of his bad desires, and he saw his coveted prey was about to
                     escape, Meacham resolved to make fight, well knowing that, do what he might,
                     his wealth would ensure him an army of supporters.
                  And Dewitt, keenly awake so soon as Annette had reciprocated his predilections,
                     had given Meacham's history, and himself had observed his conduct at Mr.
                     Vinton's, fathomed the modern Bothwell at once. He soon imagined something of
                     what was in the unprincipled libertine's mind, and decided to keep an "eye" on
                     him. This solicitude for Annette making him desirous to learn all of his
                     character possible, he now improved all opportunities to meet him that offered
                     themselves.
                  It was for this reason that he now often visited V— where were Meacham's
                     headquarters. Yet, though he had been to V— half a dozen times during his stay
                     at his uncle's, which had now extended to two weeks, he yet had learned nothing
                     really derogatory to that person's standing.
                  But the time was fast approaching when his watchful vigilance was to be
                     rewarded.
                  About this time he and Annette were walking one evening about sunset from his
                     uncle's to her father's house. Passing the shingle-pen on the way they remarked
                     a written handbill tacked to the squared end of one of the many logs of which
                     the structure was composed. They stepped up and read it. It was a call from
                     Isaac Meacham to such young men as desired employment in cutting and hauling
                     logs during the coming winter to meet him that evening in V— at a certain
                     public house which he designated, where terms of engagement could be entered
                     into and ratified.
                  After reading the document to its close Dewitt remarked:—
                  "I will be there!"
                  "You go there!" said Annette fondly, "Why?"
                  "Why!" replied Dewitt, throwing his arm around the girl's waist, "because, my
                     sweet! I think he is a bad man, and I don't like his coming to your house, and
                     I want to get at his thoughts and learn something so that I may have good
                     reason to prevent it."
                  Annette looked up into her lover's handsome face, hers expressing glad pride
                     and glad love that she was cherished by so manly a protector, though she
                     blushed very deeply, appearing very beautiful, as she candidly responded:—
                  "I believe, as I have formerly admitted, that you are right. But don't get into
                     danger. Take care of yourself for my sake. You will, won't you?"
                  "I will try and be discreet," answered Dewitt. "I shall remember all the time
                     that there is a dear girl thinking of me."
                  The two exchanged the usual fond salutation that should always accompany such
                     language between young lovers.
                  They walked along to Mr. Vinton's house, conversing earnestly on the way. At
                     the door of the house Dewitt bade Annette good-bye, hastened back to his
                     uncle's, asked Thomas to accompany him, and together they hurried over to
                     V—.
               
               
                  V.
                  The evening was well advanced when Dewitt and Thomas arrived in the little
                     village, though they had traveled with considerable expedition. Entering the
                     little public house where Meacham had convened his employes, they discovered at
                     once that his business was completed and that he had adjourned his company to
                     the public room where he and they were about to ratify their engagements with
                     the usual binding "drinks" all around.
                  They were draining off their mutual pledges just as Dewitt and Thomas entered
                     the room.
                  Meacham, having drank before during the evening, they perceived was somewhat
                     heated.
                  Glancing at Dewitt, while an exultant smile played over his large features, he
                     thought within himself:—
                  
                  "Now is my time. None but friends are around me. I will give that young York
                     Cock, as well as them, something to think about. Curse me, if it isn't lucky he
                     has come here! What can it be for I wonder, and at this time of night? But no
                     matter! Damned if I don't believe I can circumvent him and humble the pride of
                     his handsome English filly yet."
                  He spoke to his company:—
                  "Boys, fill up! All around again! Tom have a glass! Mr. Dimond shall I have the
                     pleasure of proposing a toast to your acceptance?"
                  Thomas shook his head; his countenance was very grave; he usually complied with
                     the customs of the neighborhood when visiting such places; but he would not
                     drink now; he divined the hate that was in Meacham's heart toward his cousin.
                     Dewitt replied aloud:—
                  "Thank you! No sir!"
                  "Well! all right!" said Meacham, ironically, while his eye gleamed
                     wickedly.
                  The glasses were filled. Meacham raised his in his hand and clinked it to the
                     left and to the right, continuing:—
                  "Boys! Here's to the health of my pretty Annette; the loveliest, as she is the
                     best girl in all T— county."
                  Although he did not add her last name, none of them could mistake his meaning
                     or his manner; they knew of but one Annette in the county.
                  Thomas was startled from his tracks. He had not imagined the man to be so bold
                     and so bad as he had now proclaimed himself.
                  Dewitt, ten feet from the speaker, sprang to his side at a single bound,
                     exclaiming fiercely:—
                  "Scoundrel! What do you mean? She is my promised wife."
                  "Well! what of that?" sneered the bullying libertine, "There's many a
                     slip—"
                  He did not complete the quotation. Dewitt, six feet high, weighing a hundred
                     and seventy-five, and taught to box in the same excellent school where his
                     brother Will had conquered the Science, struck just one blow as he
                     whispered:—
                  "That of it!" and Isaac Meacham rolled in the dirt on the floor,
                     and there was plenty of it.
                  He did not get up again until he was helped up.
                  Two or three of the more depraved of Meacham's friends immediately rushed
                     toward the prompt defender of virtue, designing to crush him down. Thomas
                     stepped between. One of them called to him as he came rushing viciously
                     on:—
                  "Tom Dimond, he struck without giving warning, and now we're going through with
                     the muss, and you'd better keep out of it."
                  Thomas replied coolly enough:—
                  "O, I stand by my cousin 'Witt of course."
                  Dewitt, mindful of the menacing peril, as the rush was being made toward him,
                     and desirous to get a word in before he should close with them in fight, sprang
                     upon the counter of the bar over which the "drinks" were dealt.
                  At the same moment, Thomas, watchful of everything, stepped into the alley-way
                     at the end of the counter.
                  Two of the company were assisting the stunned Meacham to his feet. And
                     singularly enough, the bar-keeper had poised an empty bottle to hurl at the
                     head of the "rough" who had addressed himself to Thomas.
                  At this interesting stage in the impending melee, the voice of Dewitt checked
                     the rising elements of war, and ultimately soothed to quietness and peace.
                     Before the ruffians had completed their rush he spoke to them; collectedly and
                     earnestly. His impressiveness of tone, and more particularly the substance of
                     his speech, arrested their attention, checking their hostile demonstration.
                  He said:—
                  "Men! for your sisters' sakes give me one word before you attack
                     me; then if you must come, come, and I'll defend myself as best I can."
                  "Go ahead, my dandy!" said a big, heavy, burly young man, reckoned at the time
                     to be the most desperate character in those pineries—"go ahead! We'll listen.
                     We are a little wild sometimes; and sometimes do things of which we are ashamed
                     afterwards. But usually we are on the square. We are awake and have our senses
                     now; so, go ahead! You shall have a fair shake anyhow. Any man who stands up so
                     boldly for the girls deserves it; and I'll fight for you myself before more
                     than one at a time shall touch you. Go ahead with your speech!"
                  
                  The backwoodsman held his peace.
                  Dewitt improved his privileges:—
                  "You know the young lady—" The crowd smiled at his styling Annette a young
                     lady; but Dewitt didn't mind that; he saw the smile was favorable, and so
                     continued, hopefully:—
                  "You know the young lady whose name Isaac Meacham has so disrespectfully
                     introduced to your notice this evening, is as pure and good as any girl in
                     Michigan. If allowed to bandy her name about as he pleases, how long do you
                     think the names of others—of your sisters, will be safe from his
                     desecrations?—how long will their persons be safe from his
                     polluting touch?"
                  Dewitt would have said more, more fully explaining the results to which such
                     conduct as Meacham's inevitably tends; but now, one of the crowd of better
                     heart than some, seeing justice was likely to triumph, boldly threw his
                     influence in her favor, quickly interposing:—
                  "That's so Pete!" addressing one of those who was supporting the villain on his
                     feet; "Ike Meacham has already deeply insulted a girl who is pretty nearly
                     related to somebody I know."
                  Meacham faintly whispered in Pete's ears:—
                  "The cowardly hound lies."
                  But it was too true, as Pete learned in less than six months, when his pretty
                     young sister, only fifteen years old, had commenced to carry around before the
                     world a burden of shame that should weigh her down and dim the brightness of
                     her countenance for all the rest of a long weary life—another precious Margaret
                     made supremely wretched. Pete learned in the course of time; now however he
                     listened to the treacherous Meacham who was leaning upon him, replying angrily
                     to him who had advised him:—
                  "I'll tend to your case Joe, as soon as I can leave here."
                  "Fool!" retorted Joe.
                  "I can't leave here now," reiterated Pete with rising passion.
                  Joe was sensible and remained silent.
                  Dewitt, perceiving that he had gained his point, leaped down from the counter,
                     saying pleasantly as he and Thomas passed through the throng toward the
                     door:—
                  "Good night, my friends! We're going home."
                  Many responded heartily, "Good night!" one or two adding:—
                  "You're bully!"
                  The master of the situation passing close to Meacham, that character managed to
                     hiss out from between his teeth:
                  "Wait and see what time has in store for you."
                  Dewitt, without giving other reply, slapped the villian slightly and
                     contemptuously in the face with the back of his hand and walked with Thomas out
                     into the night.
                  Meacham groaned desperately, in an agony of impotent rage. He was completely
                     powerless, then, to harm the man he hated.
                  As to what transpired in the room after the cousins left—how Meacham reconciled
                     himself with the defection of his friends, and how Joe and Pete settled their
                     difficulty I have never been informed.
                  Dewitt and Thomas went directly home and went to bed, to enjoy the sweet and
                     peaceful sleep enjoyed by the healthful and worthy, and to get rest and
                     refreshment preparatory for the great hunt which was to come off on the
                     morrow—a hunt for deer, wolves, bears, and whatever game of consequence should
                     come within their range.
               
               
                  VI.
                  Morning came betimes, lovely and warm, harbinger of the mellow Indian summer
                     day of November.
                  The young hunters arose early and prepared themselves for the arduous sports of
                     the day.
                  The hunt was to be prosecuted by some fifty persons, the masculine portion of
                     the inhabitants of some three or four contiguous towns; the plan of operation
                     being to surround a circular tract of country embracing about two hundred
                     square miles, with a dense thicket of hemlock and cedar of about two miles
                     square, and a well known haunt of wild beasts, in the center, toward which all
                     were to approach, surely and gradually, scouring the woods thoroughly as they
                     advanced. The residences of Mr. Dimond and Mr. Vinton were about a mile from,
                     and nearly equidistant from the commencement of the thicket.
                  
                  At the commencement of the hunt Dewitt, Thomas and Leonard were to be stationed
                     about three-fourths of a mile from one another on the side of the circle next
                     to these residences. Naturally, therefore, as the day should advance and they
                     should progress in the hunt and toward the same common point in the thicket,
                     they would gradually draw nearer together and near to the residences named.
                  These adjuncts of the story are particularly stated because the respective
                     positions which the young men held with regard to one another and to the two
                     dwellings is a matter of considerable consequence in its bearings on the
                     incidents which succeed.
                  Their stations for starting in the morning being about five miles from Mr.
                     Dimond's, Dewitt had not time to visit Annette and acquaint her with the
                     circumstances of his encounter with Meacham on the previous evening. Nor, had
                     he had the time, would he have visited her particularly with that object in
                     view, not surmising, if he should dare molest her at all, that that individual
                     would make any demonstration immediately.
                  This fact also has great weight in shaping the events of the day as they relate
                     to the youthful lovers.
                  So Dewitt, not making time to visit Annette that morning, went directly with
                     Thomas to their posts so soon as they had eaten breakfast.
                  They had scarcely reached their respective places when the sharp crack of the
                     rifle was heard at a designated point on the great circle, immediately
                     succeeded by all the others on the grand round, and the hunt commenced.
                  The hunters, stationed at regular intervals along the circle, and obedient to
                     rules that should maintain it perfect or nearly so, during the day, advanced
                     slowly and warily, each on a line toward the thicket, but in zig-zag course,
                     beating the ground thoroughly and gradually driving the game to the center;
                     some one occasionally firing a shot and bringing down, or wounding, a wolf or a
                     deer.
                  This method of proceeding continued from about eight o'clock until near noon,
                     when there had been probably half a dozen animals of different kinds killed
                     around the circle.
                  At twelve o'clock, Dewitt and Thomas, having traversed two converging spokes of
                     the great wheel, arrived respectively to within a quarter of a mile of one
                     another; the first near to the dwelling of Mr. Vinton, and the second in close
                     proximity to that of his father.
                  Jane came out from her father's door and handed Thomas a lunch, and Annette did
                     the same kindness for Dewitt at nearly the same time, the latter also giving
                     her lover a kiss and wishing he might kill half a dozen bears, and then running
                     to feed Leonard who called to her nearly half a mile away in the wood.
                  The young men now continued their course through the dark pine wood more
                     rapidly toward the common center which was not more than two miles distant, and
                     quite often catching sight of the flitting form of some wild denizen of the
                     forest as they advanced. At twenty minutes to two o'clock the hunters had
                     penetrated some little distance into the cedar thicket, they saw game quite
                     often, and shots were fired numerously. At this time Dewitt was immediately
                     driving three bears, a mother and two well grown cubs. He had fired his rifle
                     at them once or twice, but, though a fair shot, their movements were so
                     uncertain to him as a novice in that kind of hunting, and they were yet so
                     distant, he had not succeeded in hitting.
                  The cordon of fifty rifles was progressing surely toward the center, like a
                     fence of fire, Dewitt in chase of the three bears, when suddenly an unusual and
                     great clamor on the opposite side of the thicket caused the ugly brutes to face
                     about and advance directly toward him. Bears are very sagacious animals. The
                     movements of these three had indicated uneasiness for some time, as if their
                     instincts had begun to divine the nature of the relentless trap in which they
                     were being enclosed, and hence the uproar in advance confirming their fears
                     turned them about to face what those instincts doubtless regarded as a less
                     danger.
                  The amateur hunter, keenly watchful of their movements, paused to receive them.
                     On they came, tearing wildly past. He discharged his gun and stopped the career
                     of one of the cubs; but the mother and the other still rushed on. Fired with
                     ardor he turned in the chase, loading his gun as he swiftly pursued. He knew it
                     was a violation of the rules governing the hunt to leave an opening in the
                     surrounding circle of rifles, except in certain remarkable contingencies, but
                     there were two noble bears escaping, and he thought he might "drop" one of them
                     before they could proceed far; after
                     which he could hasten to again fill the gap in the line of guard, and probably
                     before anything of consequence should have escaped.
                  Thomas and Leonard, on either side, saw him rushing off, and called to him to
                     return to his post. The calls of the friends were not heeded.
                  Dewitt's blood was up.
               
               
                  VII.
                  To meet the demands of the occasion and fully explain what transpired during
                     the next few minutes, it will now be necessary to return to Annette, whom the
                     reader last saw handing Dewitt his something to eat.
                  After parting with her lover at noon, and after having carried Leonard his
                     dinner, Annette returned into the cabin—her heart laughing with happiness—and
                     busied herself about her household cares, occasionally exchanging a few words
                     with her father, whom the severities of the clear, sharp, fall and winter
                     weather of that climate, so different to that of the South of England where he
                     was bred, had latterly crippled and confined to the house with rheumatism.
                  In this manner she had passed an hour or more, very agreeably, indulging many
                     pleasant thoughts with regard to her golden future with Dewitt. At the
                     expiration of this time, and identically as Dewitt turned to pursue the fleeing
                     bears, and while she was so happily engaged, she was disturbed by an unexpected
                     knock at the door.
                  She stepped lightly to the door, lifted the latch, and opened it. Isaac Meacham
                     stood there confronting her; his face wearing a self-satisfied smile; his left
                     hand resting on his silver-mounted rifle; the fingers of his right clasping a
                     neatly folded note. After tendering the compliments of the day he presented the
                     note, requesting his fair auditor to read it.
                  Annette took the note, opened it, saw it was written in a fair, round,
                     school-girl hand, and read:—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 Birdsall's, 1 P. M., Nov. 7th, 18—.
                              
                              DEAR FRIEND:—I have been taken suddenly sick and am very unwell;
                                 and am all alone. Father and Peter are both in the hunt to-day. Mr.
                                 Meacham came in just when he was needed. If he hadn't I don't know
                                 what I should have done. He says he will carry this billet to you
                                 and come back with you. Won't you come with him? Do! He is very
                                 kind. I need you very much. I am always your loving friend.
                              
                                 CLARA T. BIRDSALL.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  Annette, though intelligent enough in general, was, still, not superior to
                     being imposed upon. She heartily believed in her heart that Meacham was a
                     villain, but for all that she did not now imagine he might now be on an errand
                     of treachery. She did not once suspect the note might be an imposition of his
                     own. If she had she would not have entertained for a moment the thought of
                     accompanying him. And as she thought it to be she did not at all like to trust
                     herself alone in his power in the forest. Yet, the girl Clara, who she believed
                     had written the note, being much liked in the community, as well as being
                     highly esteemed by Annette herself, she could not coldly neglect her call for
                     womanly sympathy and assistance. What should she do?
                  She decided. She must go with Meacham and see Clara.
                  But why must she accompany him? Why not dismiss him and go alone;
                     her father being too much crippled to accompany her? Annette asked herself
                     these questions; and answered them to herself almost sooner than asked:—
                  "To refuse Isaac Meacham's company will be of no avail. He will certainly join
                     me before I can get to Birdsall's if he desires to be with me."
                  She believed it of him. She was grievously troubled.
                  She stepped across the room and handed the note to Mr. Vinton. He read it;
                     remarking in very low tones as he concluded, so that only she could hear:—
                  "Yes, you must go with him. It would be impossible for me to walk as far as
                     Birdsall's to-day, and God might not spare you in your extremity if you should
                     refuse to accept the missions of mercy he sends to you."
                  Aloud, he said to Meacham:—
                  "Take good care of her, Mr. Meacham. You know the forest about here is full of
                     flying wild beasts to-day."
                  
                  "I will take good care of her," responded Meacham in a tone that betrayed a
                     peculiar significance in spite of himself; he felt so exultant.
                  The father and daughter both caught something of his hidden thought, and were
                     troubled. But the die was cast. Their word was passed and they would not recall
                     it unless for some reason more tangible.
                  Annette took down her bonnet from its peg in the wall, put it on her head, tied
                     the strings, stepped to the door, and said to the waiting and expectant
                     Meacham; her countenance more serious than it had been since her mother's
                     death:—
                  "I am ready."
                  They left Mr. Vinton's directly and proceeded on the way to Birdsall's.
                  The path they pursued toward the cabin they sought, which stood in a small
                     clearing about a mile distant in the wood, trended off at an angle of about
                     twenty degrees to that which Dewitt had followed down to the cedar swamp nearly
                     two hours previously; the latter path lying between the first named and about
                     three rods distant from a very high fence of rails bounding a portion of Mr.
                     Dimond's estate, and built as a protection against the inroads of the deer.
                  The two whose thoughts, tastes, and principles were so widely at variance,
                     pursued their way at a fast walk, Meacham endeavoring to interest his companion
                     by hazarding conjectures as to the possible results of the chase; Annette
                     replying as briefly and as seldom as possible. Since becoming engaged to Dewitt
                     and learning something of the beauties of his character she had learned to
                     regard Meacham with a much deeper repugnance than at any time previously, and
                     hence it was now a great task to her to hold discourse with him at all. Love
                     and admiration for a worthy object seemed to refine, exalt, and glorify her
                     nature. Every word the bad man now uttered, though spoken in the coolest of
                     language on the coolest of subjects, seemed to outrage all her best instincts
                     and feelings of delicacy and refinement.
                  This is almost invariably the case with innocence and modesty when they feel
                     themselves to be brought into juxtaposition with gross vice. It makes no
                     difference if the vicious man talk virtue so long as he is not able to beguile;
                     their instincts having once detected him they loathe his presence
                     all the same. When they have once felt the touch of sin they recoil from it
                     afterwards as from something horrible. Just so now with Annette.
                  Therefore the two had thus pursued their way about thirty rods, Annette spite
                     of her lively sympathy for the suffering Clara wishing herself safely at home
                     again until Meacham should be out of the way, when the spectacle of the two
                     fleeing bears, with Dewitt in hot chase, burst suddenly upon their startled
                     eyes. The bears, having kept to the path already traced by Dewitt, had arrived
                     in their headlong course to nearly exactly between Annette and her escort on
                     one side, and the high deer fence on the other, when they also became aware of
                     the presence of those two human beings. And at nearly the same instant they
                     also perceived Mr. Vinton's cabin and little clearing ahead, as well as Mr.
                     Vinton himself, who, worried in mind since his daughter's departure had limped
                     out into the enclosure to watch the receding form of the loved child as far as
                     possible while she was going away with that bad man among the dark trees.
                  Thus were the bears situated. Mr. Dimond's high fence on the left; Annette and
                     her wicked companion at the right; Mr. Vinton's cabin and himself ahead; Dewitt
                     an excellent runner, equal to his grandfather in his prime, vengefully pursuing
                     not more than ten yards behind.
                  The sagacious brutes were perplexed; they thought themselves surely trapped;
                     they turned in concert to meet what they regarded as the least formidable
                     danger. Dewitt was ready as they turned and confronted him; he had just
                     finished charging his rifle, a feat he had already managed to accomplish twice
                     while swiftly running. The young bear was between him and the other. He fired
                     his gun; the young bear fell, shot through the head.
                  The old mother lowered her muzzle and snuffed the welling blood of her fallen
                     and expiring offspring. She knew that both her cubs were down, and she knew as
                     well as you could have known had you been there, who had stricken them. With a
                     savage growl she sprang over the writhing body and rushed directly at Dewitt.
                     She was very angry. Her eyes were lurid and red. She did not swerve either to
                     the right or the left; nor did he. He thought his quickness and dexterity would
                     more than match her great strength
                     and her strong, sharp claws. I think he was a foolish young man then, but you
                     may take into account that he was not then so well acquainted with angry she
                     bears as he became in a very few minutes, and that he had caught sight of old
                     Mr. Vinton, of his love, and of the man he despised, all looking on. Please
                     pardon him if he was over desirous to distinguish himself just a little in
                     their eyes.
                  He met the raging beast. He threw down his empty and now useless rifle—
                        usless
                        useless
                      unless he had clubbed it—slipped his hand into his pocket and drew
                     forth a long, slender, Damascus-tempered dirk he had purchased on the docks in
                     Buffalo for just such an emergency. He had time to open the knife. Then the
                     clinch and the crash came.
                  The man and the bear closed in with one another in deadly embrace. Dewitt
                     struck rapidly, but surely, at each blow the point of his dirk pricking the
                     heart of the savage beast. The bear tore and mangled him with her cruel
                     claws.
               
               
                  VIII.
                  At the first, Annette, urged by a terrible fear for her friend that agitated
                     her heart, her voice ringing far into the depths of the wood, involuntarily
                     called out in loud, clear tones:—
                  "Help! help!"
                  And as soon as she had cried out, being on the thither side of Meacham, she
                     sprang past him to run to Dewitt's assistance.
                  Meacham, ruled by his malevolent heart, raised his gun and sighted. While she
                     was springing past, Annette saw and comprehended the movement just in time.
                     Checking her forward movement and veering in her course she seized the rifle
                     barrel in her hands and wrenched it down, before the would-be-murderer could
                     discharge it, exclaiming in accents that might have intimidated:—
                  "Villain! would you murder him?"
                  When under strong excitement women often answer in words, regardless of
                     consequences, to inward emotions that have been excited by hearing or seeing
                     something which does violence to their sympathies. So now, Annette, in horror
                     and condemnation of Meacham's demonstration, had spoken the truth as it rose in
                     her heart, unmindful that it might madden to the utmost the now reckless man
                     she was confronting.
                  Her words did fill Meacham's heart at once with the most deadly fury—a fury
                     that he was cowardly enough to direct toward her, as just previously his hate
                     had been directed against her lover. She maddened him terribly, though he yet
                     controlled his reason. Seizing the lock in his hand to prevent a discharge, he
                     exerted a superhuman strength to wrench the gun from her, saying savagely:—
                  "God damn you, girl! let go! It's the only chance to save his life. And if I
                     miss the bear and hit him it is better to be shot and die instantly than to
                     linger in hours of agony and then finally die."
                  But he would have shot his hated foe, surely—he acknowledged as much afterwards
                     in his "cups"—and the girl who loved that foe knew it. She clung to the rifle
                     barrel with desperate energy and a resolution greater than his; saying, her
                     voice fierce in its tone of agony:—
                  "You cannot fire this gun towards him until you have first killed me."
                  The infuriated Meacham wrenched with the strength of a giant, thrashing the
                     heroic girl around on the ground with vengeful fury and bruising her cruelly in
                     his desperate endeavors to tear the gun from her grasp. But his efforts, savage
                     and powerful as they were, were vain. He could not overcome her, nor get the
                     gun from her.
                  Love is worth so much—sometimes.
                  Ninety seconds expired from the time of Dewitt's first clinch with the bear;
                     then she released her fierce embrace, falling to the ground, dead. Dewitt
                     staggered a few paces from the brute he had conquered and sat down on the
                     ground. Annette, no longer afraid that Meacham's wicked spirit would strive to
                     harm her lover now the bear was dead and he could not screen his evil purpose
                     under pretence of firing at her, let go the gun and flew to the support of the
                     fainting man.
                  Old Mr. Vinton having heard his daughter's cry for help, made at the
                     commencement of the struggle, and having also been a witness throughout the
                     fearful scene, came hobbling
                     painfully up. Meacham stood motionless where the sight of Dewitt and the
                     fleeing bears had first arrested his steps. He regarded the trio with eyes that
                     gleamed the most baleful hate, but he dared not attack them now.
                  Dewitt was badly mangled. The bear had torn great furrows with the claws on her
                     hind feet down nearly the whole length of his legs. She had bitten deep with
                     her teeth into his left shoulder in many places and had also gored his back
                     badly with her fore paws.
                  Still though he was sadly torn, the wounds were all flesh wounds and not
                     therefore necessarily mortal. Nevertheless, he was bleeding profusely and
                     fainting, and, unless he received instant assistance, must soon perish from
                     loss of blood.
                  The help—and help that was efficient, was at hand. Annette and her father at
                     once tore their clothing with unsparing hands and made bandages to stop the
                     flow of blood. In three minutes they had succeeded quite well, and Annette,
                     sitting on the ground, received her lover's head against her bosom.
                  At this time, Thomas, who had remained standing in his tracks when Dewitt ran
                     after the bears, having also heard Annette's piercing call for help, and obeyed
                     it, came running in. As he approached, Meacham perceiving him, slunk silently
                     away. Two crimes that the villain had meditated perpetrating that day had
                     commenced to recoil on him.
                  Thomas, understanding at once what was best to be done, ran swiftly to Mr.
                     Vinton's house and procured an axe and some short pieces of rope with which to
                     construct a litter, that they might carry Dewitt without disturbance to his
                     wounds to a place of shelter.
                  While he was away, Dewitt became insensible.
                  Annette was almost heart-broken, now. She caressed her lover's noble head
                     repeatedly, making plaintive moan:—
                  "Oh, my love! my love! what if he should die! what if he should die!"
                  This she repeated over to herself many times in a heart-broken way, her father
                     looking sadly and silently on. She repeated the words over many times, until at
                     last the direction of her moan changed a little, another thought of grief
                     joining in to still more harrow up her troubled heart. She kept on with her
                     plaintive moan, lowly and most sorrowfully:—
                  "What if he should die! what if he should die! my love! my love!" to which she
                     added after a little, "and he doesn't know! he doesn't know, why I was walking
                     with that wretch!"
                  Dewitt revived; he said faintly:—
                  "My own sweet, I shall not die; and I know you would not have been walking with
                     Isaac Meacham unless you believed it to be for good cause. My faith in you is
                     not faint," and again he fainted.
                  Thomas returned with the axe and rope and soon constructed a litter. He made a
                     frame of proper size, of pine limbs, covering it deep with short soft boughs
                     broken from the same tree. Then, when he had completed the bed, he and Annette
                     lifted the insensible Dewitt and placed him on it, and immediately raising it
                     in their hands, one at each end, they carried him to Mr. Vinton's house where
                     they placed him on Annette's bed.
                  His cousin desired to carry him to his father's, but Annette would not hearken
                     to any such proposition. It was her lover who was in suffering,
                     and it must be only she who should minister to his needs and nurse him back to
                     life and strength. Thomas, seeing she was determinedly bent on her purpose and
                     that it would wound her sadly to combat her feelings, was fain to acquiesce.
                     And so they carried him as I have said and laid him on Annette's own bed, just
                     where she desired to have him.
                  After they had got the wounded man into the house Thomas hurried for the
                     physician who practiced in that locality. He returned with him about nightfall,
                     when they found Annette patiently watching by the side of her lover, entirely
                     unmindful of her own severe bruises. And she never did give her own hurts any
                     attention, though the fair white skin was blackened in very many places under
                     her clothing. Her anxiety for Dewitt kept her so unmindful of herself that no
                     one knew she had been hurt until long after.
                  Annette Vinton was, or rather is, a most choice soul.
                  When the doctor was come and had examined his patient he soon saw that, the
                     effusion of blood having been effectually checked in the woods by Annette and
                     her father, Dewitt had revived
                     somewhat, and had already commenced to recuperate. He saw that all his patient
                     required in order to recover was just a little faithful care in the present. He
                     therefore labored over him all the night, feeding him light cordials, as he
                     dared, to sustain his spirits buoyant and equable, and applying the proper
                     outward embrocations, etc., to extract the poison imparted from the bear's
                     claws and to soothe the fretfulness of his wounds. He succeeded so well with
                     him that when morning came Dewitt was very much revived and he regarded his
                     case as quite hopeful.
                  And the patient did gain new blood and new strength under Annette's untiring
                     watchfulness, from the commencement; slowly, at first, as was to be expected;
                     but there was never a relapse; he was on his feet again in about three
                     weeks.
                  It was about a week after the hunt that Leonard informed his sister that the
                     note Meacham had brought to her on that day must have been a forgery of his
                     own—that Clara Birdsall had not been unwell and that she had never given a note
                     to him to carry to her.
                  On receipt of this startling information—information that confirmed her belief
                     in the baseness which her mind had always suspected was inherent in him—Annette
                     divined at once what had been his motive. The divination disturbed her greatly.
                     In times past she had but imagined what might be his worst object in seeking
                     her society; now, she almost knew. The knowledge gave her a
                     terrible shock. She felt almost as if he had succeeded in his purpose. The
                     thought of how vilely he might have acted toward her had she continued with him
                     in the woods shocked her so that she hardly knew what to do. Greatly
                     distressed, she ran immediately into the presence of Dewitt, hoping that there
                     she might relieve herself, or that he might assist her. Their love had
                     progressed so far before his hurts that she had learned to regard him as her
                     refuge, and now she thought he might be so far recovered as to be able to talk
                     to her rightly, as she knew he had often done before.
                  Grieving now, she went to the side of the bed whereon he lay, raised his head
                     and placed one arm under it, embraced his person with the other, and sobbed out
                     as she laid her head on the pillow beside his:—
                  "Oh, my friend! my friend! If you had not followed the bears on that day Isaac
                     Meacham would have put the last outrage upon me and I would not now allow your
                     dear self to touch me."
                  An American girl of refinement would not have spoken thus, even to her lover;
                     but English girls, though holding in their hearts a sense of delicacy equally
                     refined, receive a different education to the American, and hence in times of
                     crises are often more outspoken; and any girl, after she has given
                     her whole heart to her lover discovers a change in herself which impels her to
                     open her whole soul to him, however much her previous education
                     may hold her mind in check.
                  The girl lay by her lover's side, weeping passionately—bitterly.
                  "My darling!" smiled Dewitt, "don't grieve. You are not in fault in the least.
                     If you had not been sent to my assistance to bind my bleeding wounds in time,
                     what would have become of me?—where would I now have been? Can't you perceive?
                     Heaven has used Meacham as an instrument with which to minister to our
                     welfare."
                  "O!" said Annette, hushing her grief, and her countenance lighting, "I had not
                     thought of it in that way."
                  And pursuing the thought he had given her it soon filled her with a great
                     delight. To think: that, instead of God allowing Meacham to come to abuse her,
                     he had, after all, sent the miserable wretch as an agent necessary to saving
                     the life of her lover. The thought made her so happy that she now hugged that
                     lover to her heart, while her face was radiant with joy as she continued:—
                  "My darling Darling! You are indeed a Comforter!"
                  "Both ways are probably correct. My mother always urged it upon her children
                     that God always orders everything for the best."
                  "I believe it," fervently responded Annette, kissing the smooth white brow of
                     her future husband.
                  Dewitt had not designed visiting at his uncle's more than a couple of weeks
                     when he first came to T— county, but his acquaintance with Annette and the
                     subsequent conduct of Meacham decided him never to go away and leave the fair
                     girl of his choice behind him. Should he do thus the villain might yet gain the
                     opportunity to accomplish his base purpose.
                  Dewitt believed this of him. As did Annette, he now believed him capable of the
                     basest of actions if opportunity
                     should invite. And he was. He was capable of anything treacherous and base.
                  Betraying the girl Clara to ruin, and afterwards forging her signature to the
                     note to Annette were not the only meannesses of which he had been guilty. After
                     the perpetration of those duplicities he soon sought to deprave his victim's
                     morality. After he had deceived Annette with the forgery he became fearful that
                     she and Clara would get their heads together, and while comparing notes, as
                     women and girls so often do, learn concerning his duplicity.
                  Fearful, therefore, he resolved to prevent such a contretemps by making Clara acquainted with the circumstance and
                     bribing her to secrecy through her love for him; or, if he could not thus
                     affect her, then to terrify her into silence. He visited her with this purpose
                     in view;—he visited her and soon learned more of her character than he had yet
                     discovered; he soon learned that she was a girl of character. He
                     could neither bribe nor terrify her into silence, nor into acknowledging the
                     writing of the note. Though he had degraded her in a matter of the greatest
                     moment, and had succeeded in making her his in a measure, yet, he could not,
                     with all his arts and power, induce her to sanction an untruth; rather, this
                     movement of his opened her mind to his true character and was the cause of her
                     voluntarily speaking and divulging the true state of the case to Leonard. The
                     unprincipled scoundrel by disclosing himself to the sweet girl who had trusted
                     him, trusting to the strength of her love and the fear he meant to incite to
                     protect him in his wicked arts, brought upon himself by these means the very
                     catastrophe he dreaded.
                  It was a knowledge of all the foregoing facts that influenced Dewitt to decide
                     to never leave T— county and leave his betrothed behind him. He therefore
                     informed her of his decision and the reasons therefor and asked her to return
                     to the East with him at once. Being a sensible English girl, and loving him
                     with her whole heart, Annette did not combat him with any coy scruples, but
                     acquiesced as soon as he had explained himself, saying she was ready to be
                     married on the instant if he thought best.
                  Accordingly they were married as soon as his convalescence would warrant.
                     Leonard and Jane having been engaged for about a year were married at the same
                     time; so that the crippled Mr. Vinton would still receive kind female care
                     after his daughter should have departed.
                  Dewitt proceeded to New York directly after the wedding. He now, with the
                     matronly, blooming Annette and their interesting family of fine young children,
                     occupies two hundred and fifty of the original five hundred acres of land
                     purchased by his grandfather of Mr. Phelps at Canandaigua. His brother Chester
                     occupies the other half. Some memorable events that have transpired in his life
                     are given in sketch No. 9.
               
            
            
               
               DIAMOND LEAVES.
               VIII.
               LUCY.
               THE life of Lucy Dimond has not enough of stirring romance in it to make a story
                  as the story-writers look at the matter.
               From the age of about fourteen, she, and one of the neighboring young farmers
                  walked pleasantly together on Sunday afternoons in her father's shady lane until
                  she was about twenty, when one fine morning they stepped together into the
                  neighboring church and were married.
               That is all there is of it.
               There was no display made; and after the celebration of the Sacrament the young
                  couple retired to the husband's home near by, where they have since resided in
                  quiet peace and happiness.
               Lucy was very lovely as a girl; equally lovely with her cousin Bascom's wife, if
                  not quite so handsome; more lovely than any of her sisters; having also mental
                  charms and powers greater than theirs, it was anticipated by her watchful and
                  interested friends she would make a brilliant match. But, unlike her sisters Belle
                  and Ida, her nature seemed to crave only—love. She has been often known to
                  disagree with her mother and Ida and maintain that if a man have a good, kind
                  heart, though with only ordinary intelligence, she could, if she loved him, be
                  just as happy with such a one as any.
               And she has certainly verified the declaration with her practice. I believe she is
                  quite as happy with her husband, who is a man of only common intellect, but who
                  has "a heart as big as an Ox's," as is her sister Belle with her husband, and
                  Belle is one of the happiest of women.
               
               The younger sister, Maud—fashioned more after the pattern of Ida and Julia—yet at
                  home at twenty-five and unmarried, visits her often, and nearly as often says to
                  Mr. Johnson—Lucy's husband—that she knows she could never fancy such a man as he
                  is, but hopes if she ever gets married, she may be as happy as dear Lu-Lu is.
               Her days of courtship and her after life running so smoothly, evenly, and happily
                  that there has never been an event nor a break in the current, of sufficient
                  consequence, on which to hang a tale, I shall not, therefore, undertake to
                  interest the readers of romance with her history; but as she is a very superior
                  woman in many respects—very lovely, both in person and in heart, and is also
                  possessed of a great deal of genius, I cannot, in justice to her in regard to
                  those qualities and as a member of the Dimond family, pass her by without giving
                  her a place in this series of sketches.
               And seeing no more appropriate way, I have, therefore, decided to allow her to
                  speak for herself in a couple of very excellent compositions prepared to be, but
                  from unforeseen events which intervened, not, read by her, the one near, and the
                  other at, the close of her Seminary course.
               I deem them sufficiently meritorious to deserve a place in any young girl's
                  repertory of reading.
               The reader may perceive from the language and tone of her papers that her mind is
                  quite broad, and her heart quite generous—that her temperament is sweetly
                  religious, and that her thoughts are happily decked out by an imagination that is
                  graceful, lively, engaging, and almost speaking, of itself.
               Indeed, her mental attractions are so decidedly superior, we indulged strong hopes
                  before her marriage that she might incline to devote a portion of her time to
                  Literature. But while at school she gave her thoughts rigidly and almost
                  exclusively to her books, barely taking time to prepare the essays necessary to
                  maintain her position in her class and in the school; and those essays, though
                  some of them may be regarded as very excellent indeed, she would never allow to be
                  handed to the Press for publication.
               A thirst for the honors of Authorship could not then, or after, be awakened in her
                  mind.
               Since leaving school and since her marriage we have also entertained hopes that
                  the world might yet hear from her; but when of an evening I have been sitting with
                  the family in the great keeping-room of the Johnson farm-house, and have playfully
                  alluded to the subject, she has quietly, and with the Dimond air of decision,
                  waved her hand around to the happy group of nine young children surrounding her,
                  smiled the smile of serenest love, contentment, and satisfaction, and said in the
                  fondest of caressing tones:—
               "These are my poems; I want no others."
               After such a response from her I have sometimes felt as though it were sacrilege
                  to try to tempt her.
               If you could witness her manner of thorough, supremely happy earnestness at such
                  times, I am sure you would envy her her lot—a lot she appears to regard and
                  cherish as heaven on earth.
               She is now so averse to appearing in print—so fearful that it may distract her
                  mind, even in the least, from what she regards as nobler duties, that it has been
                  only at the expense of the utmost persuasion on my part that she would deliver the
                  following pieces into my possession to be used at my discretion. Only that she
                  esteems me very highly indeed, could I have obtained them. Sweet, pure, true Lucy!
                  only such as you could have written:—
               
                  PURITY: AN ALLEGORY.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Beautiful!
                              How beautiful is all this visible world!
                              How glorious in its action and itself!
                              But we, who name ourselves its sovereigns, we,
                              Half dust, half deity, alike unfit
                              To sink or soar, with our mix'd essence make
                              A conflict of its elements, and breathe
                              The breath of degradation and of pride,
                              Contending with low wants and lofty will,
                              Till our mortality predominates,
                              And men are—what they name not to themselves,
                              And trust not to each other."
                           
                        
                        —Byron.
                     
                  
                  An Angel was once exploring the fields of Space.
                  For many days he traveled, admiring the beauty and harmony which are blended
                     together in the placing and controlment of so many great Systems of Worlds.
                  
                  He beheld the innumerable planets and stars, sparkling and glowing with that
                     intense Light which emanates from the great Giver, and that they moved
                     majestically and without interference in the courses assigned to them. The
                     further he traveled and the more he beheld, the more the Angel discovered and
                     praised the power and glory of his Master, the Creator and Owner of the
                     Universe in which he was traveling.
                  After awhile he became weary, he had journeyed so far, and halted on one of the
                     planets to rest himself. While resting he was pleased to observe that the same
                     expression of sublime concord which dwelt in the face of the Universe existed
                     in the natural aspect of the planet whereon he had paused and now reclined his
                     tired person.
                  He sat, recumbent, high up on the side of one of its tall mountains. Vast,
                     regular, and majestic mountain ranges stretched off on either hand in
                     illimitable sweep, while intervening were broad and luxuriant table lands and
                     fertile valleys dotted with silvery lakes and banded with shining rivers whose
                     banks and borders wore the emerald fringe of natural forest growths.
                  The Angel gazing down into the wide valleys and deep intervales which lay
                     extended in broad panorama at his feet, beheld objects of various shapes and
                     sizes moving therein—objects of life and motion. He beheld and wondered, and as
                     he wondered he mused with himself:—
                  "It is my Master who has made those things of life and placed them in the
                     valleys. I will go down and address them, for, perchance, they can inform me
                     why they are there."
                  Arising to walk down into the nearmost valley he heard a strange, sharp,
                     hissing noise close by his side that attracted his attention; turning to it to
                     ascertain its cause, he beheld the cold, slimy, glistening shape of the
                     Serpent. He did not know what it was. He had never before beheld any of the
                     things of material life. The Angel looked into the glittering eyes of the
                     snake, was troubled, and spoke, displeased, addressing him:—
                  "Unshapely thing! what art thou, and what doest thou here? Why art not thou in
                     the pleasant valley below, where I perceive other objects of life?"
                  The serpent reared his flattened head, protruded his forked tongue, and
                     answered:—
                  "Angel! I know thee! Thou hast the likeness of my enemy. I am called Serpent. I
                     am a creature made by thy Master. I am pursued and destroyed by the beings in
                     the valleys. I seek solitary places to escape from my destroyers."
                  "Why is this?" demanded the Angel.
                  The serpent, angered that the Angel had at first, and still regarded him with
                     aversion, and that he spoke so commandingly, hissed forth in reply, the
                     lie:—
                  "I know not."
                  The Angel reflected within himself, was grieved, and felt perplexed. He was
                     pure and could not comprehend the workings of Discord. He asked of
                     himself:—
                  "Why does my Master suffer this?"
                  Again, now, turning to go down the mountain side, he was disturbed by a rushing
                     noise in the air directly above him; the next moment a bird fell wounded and
                     bleeding at his feet. He admired its soft, glossy feathers and its delicate
                     limbs—admired the grace of motion expressed in its fluttering pinions—looked
                     pityingly down into its glazing eyes and sadly inquired:—
                  "Pretty thing! whence comest thou and who has harmed thee?"
                  "I was playing in freedom with my sportive companions in the warm sunlight over
                     the valley below us when we were alarmed by the sound of a loud thunderous
                     noise, and immediately I felt a cold, hard substance strike me that crashed
                     mercilessly through my flesh and bones, and now I have flown here to the
                     solitary mountain side to hide me and die. I am harmed by the agency of the
                     terrible beings in the valleys," plaintively answered the bird.
                  "And why is this?" sighed the Angel.
                  "I know not," replied the bird with an expiring breath.
                  Again was the Angel grieved and perplexed, and again he asked of himself:—
                  "Why does my Master permit this?"
                  He was a pure spirit and could not comprehend the doings of wanton cruelty.
                  Once more he turned his face to the valley and would have descended had he not
                     at the instant discovered fleeing towards him, up the ascent, at its utmost
                     speed, a creature that was unlike either the bird or the serpent. It swiftly
                     approached, and soon stood panting before him. He remarked its smooth, shining hair; its grace,
                     elegance, and lithe, vigorous suppleness; its symmetry of proportions—its many
                     perfections; and, looking into its wild, terrified, pleading eyes, addressed it
                     thus:—
                  "Graceful creature! what art thou, and why fleest thou also from the
                     valley?"
                  The creature so wonderfully formed, eagerly replied:—
                  "I am an animal, and I flee from the pursuit of the beings in the valley. They
                     pursue and destroy me. There is no living thing but what they thus pursue and
                     hunt down."
                  For the third time the Angel asked, and there was now mourning in his
                     accents:—
                  "Why is this? I have asked both the bird and the serpent and they cannot say.
                     Canst thou inform me why those beings permit nothing to live in peace?"
                  And like the others the animal answered:—
                  "No! I do not know."
                  As he replied a being of the valley came up in pursuit, and the animal fled
                     terrified away. The Angel surveyed with pleased surprise the comely being as he
                     proudly approached, and looking in his clear, bold, commanding eye,
                     exclaimed:—
                  "Admirable being! who art thou?"
                  "I am man," responded the lordly being. "I was created and placed on this
                     planet, Earth, by our Master, who has given me dominion over everything that is
                     on it."
                  But the Angel not understanding, he asked in continuation of his perplexing,
                     troublous thought:—
                  "Why didst thou pursue the animal which was fleeing so fearfully from
                     thee?"
                  "Because," replied the man, "his flesh and skin, and horns are valuable as
                     articles of commerce. They gain me wealth and power."
                  But yet still was the Angel grieved and perplexed. He was pure and could not
                     comprehend the lusts of Greed and of Ambition. He would again have spoken,
                     inquiring, but the man eager in pursuit, hastened after his quarry.
                  The Angel, left alone, descended the mountain. When he had reached the valley
                     he approached the beings called men with which it was peopled. He discovered at
                     once that many of them were at variance—that besides hunting and destroying the
                     lower orders of the Animal kingdom there were dissensions, and strifes, and
                     wars among themselves. The Angel sought to investigate. Advancing to a
                     venerable looking man—a man of mild and placid countenance, he now anxiously
                     inquired:—
                  "Why is this? Why do these beautiful and comely beings who might live together
                     so happily, quarrel with one another so continually; and why do they hunt and
                     kill all the beautiful creatures that are around them?"
                  "Because," said the venerable man, they are too often governed by their bad
                     passions. They are fearful and jealous of one another. If one can overreach
                     another he seldom hesitates; and almost invariably the injured one thinks he
                     must retaliate. Thus proceeding, bad begets worse until often the acme of sin
                     is reached. It is a long, long story; too long to be completed in many a long,
                     long day."
                  The Angel turned his face in sorrow, and still mourned unsatisfied, he was pure
                     and could not comprehend the workings of Hate. The venerable man noticing his
                     grieved perplexity, and thinking to satisfy his desire "to know," spoke
                     again:—
                  "Our Master has given to us a Book in which is chronicled our Laws and the
                     history of our Life from the Beginning. I will show this Book to you, for
                     perhaps it may explain these things to your comprehension."
                  While speaking he drew the Book from the folds of his vestment and presented
                     it. The Angel received the Book, opened it, and saw that it was the Word of his
                     Master. He examined it eagerly, hoping it might satisfy him. He read that the
                     serpent was the first breather of Discord; and that cruelty, and greed, and
                     hate are all consequents. But after reading, he closed the Book still perplexed
                     and grieved. He had not sinned, was still pure, therefore could not accept it,
                     and consequently could not comprehend the meaning of Sin; but
                     still, when he turned to depart from the planet, he let fall a tear for man.
                     That tear was more precious than the Peri's.
                  When men enter the kingdom of Heaven they will be like the Angel, for it is
                     written:—
                  "Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the
                     kingdom of Heaven."
                  
                  NOTE.—I think Lucy may not be far from right, and that it would well become
                     more of the human family than I fear now do, to pay a little more attention to
                     the lesson she sets.

                  Away off to the East, embosomed in the healthful waters of the Atlantic, and
                     nestling close in to the Massachusetts coast, lies the pleasant and picturesque
                     little island of Martha's Vineyard.
                  Many years ago, when this country was first occupied by people from the Old
                     World, and long before, the fairies lived in the land; and at that time those
                     little people particularly liked to make their summer residences on the coast
                     islands; and of all those islands, Martha's Vineyard was their favorite
                     resort.
                  It was large enough; had just enough beautiful, charming landscapes; deep woods
                     festooned with clambering, hanging vines which covered and screened the most
                     delightful of bowers; pleasant intervening glades on which to sport; and pretty
                     little glens, and coves and smiling bays on which to sail their tiny pleasure
                     boats, to cause it to appear in their eyes as the most delightful summer
                     land.
                  So, many years ago, multitudes of fairies chose their abodes on that beautiful
                     island, playing their pranks there all night long, and making love to one
                     another in the flooding moonshine, the same as have their descendants in
                     England and Ireland for many centuries. Though we are descendants of European
                     races of people, Geology and fairy lore inform us that fairies first had an
                     existence in America.
                  Now these little people had lived in the Vineyard for ever so many years,
                     having among their number a silver fairy, a scarlet fairy; a green, a white,
                     and a blue fairy—fairies of all colors but one; the Culprit and the Amber
                     fairy; Puck, Mutch, Cobweb, and Little-John, and all the rest; but among them
                     all there had never been a Golden Fairy.
                  This troubled them greatly, they did so want their number complete; and they
                     very well knew—they are the most knowing little folks in the world—they very
                     well knew that the beautiful yellows of Autumn were not represented among them.
                     Troops and troops of fairies in blue, and green, and red, and all the varying,
                     intervening shades, to represent the glories of spring and all the summer time,
                     and most of the gorgeous splendors of the Fall could not satisfy them. They
                     wanted her who was to wear the most distinguishing crown of the year, to be the
                     high symbol of Harvest-Time.
                  At last their desire was filled.
                  At last, one bright, deep summer morning, about the last of August there was a
                     little baby fairy born—a daughter of the Fairy Queen. At her birth the young
                     fairy was so beautiful that when the other fairies first beheld her they became
                     wild with delight. She was very exquisitely shaped, and had a skin and a
                     complexion of Alabaster toned and tinted with the rosy glowings and lusters of
                     the most glorious summer morning; but attractive as was her complexion and
                     shape she had a yet greater charm—the crowning glory of her personal appearance
                     was her hair. She was born with it of full length, just as all fairies are;—the
                     fairies are all born mature and of full fairy statue, but are called baby
                     fairies until they discover their vocation. Her hair was fine as the finest
                     silk, and of a color so resplendent as to outshine burnished gold; and when she
                     first danced forth among her companions in the moonlight, the floss of gold
                     depending from her head and enveloping her little person to her tiny feet,
                     shone so like a resplendent Aurora that they could not fasten their eyes upon
                     her; whereupon they all danced around her exultingly, and in mad gallops,
                     flashing their blinking eyes towards her, trying to discover what she was
                     like.
                  But all would not do. For every scintillating spark shot from their eyes
                     towards her, her splendid hair returned flashes of light so dazzling and
                     overpowering that it brought the pearly tears into their eyes just as it will
                     into the bright eyes of little boys and girls who try to look into the
                     mysterious blaze of the sun.
                  
                  So, when the fairies had learned that a being was born among them who was too
                     radiant for them to contemplate, they all shouted exultingly:—
                  "A marvel! a marvel! God bless the king and queen of fairy land! They have now
                     given us that for which we have pined so long. Welcome! welcome among us!
                        Ariel,*
                        The Golden Fairy.
                  
                     *At one of my meetings with the two queens, Titania and Gloriana—who often
                        travel in company—up in the Maumee valley among the tall sycamores, where
                        they and their respective courts were enjoying a week's repose while
                        making their annual circumference of the globe, Gloriana informed me that
                        the advent of The Golden Fairy was after that of the "Ariel" immortalized
                        by Shakspeare in The Tempest. She also stated that the
                        signification of the name, "Ariel," is different when applied to a female
                        to what it is when given to a male. The name as applied to a female, has,
                        according to all fairy vocabularies, a legitimate derivation from the
                        Latin word "Aurum." Gloriana, as also Titania, imparted to me much more
                        information that may be deemed valuable.
                    
                That morning the fairies were so glad and felt in such exuberant spirits that
                     they raced and chased through the Vineyard, exploring it from center to
                     circumference until sunrise, in consequence of which some of them had the mumps
                     for a week afterwards, it not being considered conducive to the health of a
                     fairy to be out after daylight.
                  It is a custom among the fairies—and Titania has informed me that it is hence
                     the American aborigines derived their custom of giving names to persons—when
                     any new fairy makes his or her advent among their number, to give a name in
                     consonance with personal appearance, to commemorate some exploit, or to
                     illustrate some trait of character, this name immediately becoming the sign for
                     some production of the earth, or some one of its constituent elements or
                     portion of its surface over which the fairy answering to the name has unlimited
                     control.
                  Thus:—The Silver fairy came among them with eyes so remarkable that they
                     discovered lurking in their depths multitudes of stars, and from whose cool
                     wells she flashed at them cool, piercing, lance-like thrusts of light, and rays
                     constituted like the light of their favorite moonbeams; hence her name and
                     power, and she became queen of fresh water lakes and streams, &c., with
                     troops of inferior fairies, decked in glittering spangles of silver to do her
                     bidding, and who, under her direction, have put the invaluable corns of rice
                     into the mouth of many a hungry John Chinaman.
                  So, too, of the Emerald King, or leader of the fairies in green; he no sooner
                     set his foot down in the Vineyard, where he also was born, than he ran as
                     quickly as he spied it and bathed himself in a bed of vivid, bright green
                     plants and grasses, rollicking and rolling over and over at a great rate; and
                     ever since then he has worn a little moss-cup for a cap, and his coat has been
                     made of a little green leaf with little lance-like spears of grass woven into a
                     cincture for his waist, while he places on his feet sandals made from the
                     fibers of tough little plant stems. Very properly then, the Emerald fairy is
                     king of leaves, grass, and green plants—of all the vegetable world while in the
                     green.
                  Hence, it is all very plain that when the fairies shouted:—"Welcome among us!
                     The Golden Fairy," they recognized Ariel as having control over all things of a
                     golden color—over gold itself, over the yellow flowers and over the ripe golden
                     grain, and knowing as they are, they knew with all the rest, that, of all the
                     valuable things which the color gave into her care, none were so valuable as
                     Maize or Indian Corn, possessing in perfection, as it does, the properties to
                     sustain in perfection the lives of human beings.
                  Many and many a time had each and every one admired its rich, golden
                     brightness, and wondered concerning its invaluable life-sustaining principle,
                     while clambering and slipping over its polished kernels during their play.
                  Well, Ariel was absolute mistress of the invaluable golden Maize, and she had
                     bushels, and bushels, and bushels of it at her command, the Indian women
                     "raising" it by the hundreds of acres; but what was she to do with it? She was
                     a kind-hearted fairy and would not have taken corn from a hungering Indian's
                     mouth, but their large fields always produced a large surplus; what should be
                     done with the surplus?
                  While dreaming in the deep shades of the Vineyard during the soft September
                     days, Ariel pondered this important question long and well; but she could not
                     reach a satisfactory answer, and well she knew she could not, for she had
                     already during her baby-life read deeply in books of fairy lore and had there
                     learned that it is a canon in fairy law that no fairy can be the Genius, good
                     or bad, of more than one human being at a time,*
                      and invariably the fairy
                     must discover for him-or-herself whose Genius he or she is to
                     be.
                  
                     
                     *This information, as well as most matters relating to the fairies, I
                        learned of Titania in interviews had with her under the great Thorn-tree
                        down in Father's pasture.
                  
                  Ariel not having yet discovered her archetype was therefore yet a baby-fairy,
                     and meantime the surplus corn was likely to waste under her sorrowful eyes.
                     What was she to do? She could not tell, and grieve deeply as she might she soon
                     learned that lamentation of itself possessed no power to assist her.
                  Still, she could not but grieve; and particularly as she saw that the English
                     and Dutch who were now breaking into the American wildernesses for the first
                     time sorely needed some of her corn to eat. She went aboard their ships many
                     times when the sailors were slumbering, liked their appearance much, saw that
                     they needed food, and would gladly have provided for them; but she could not;
                     she was, as yet, powerless—powerless, because of all the millions of people on
                     the earth she could lavish her wealth of corn on but one, and that one she had
                     not yet discovered, and did not know how to discover.
                  Ariel mourned over her inability to use her treasure. She became sad and
                     dejected in consequence, moping about among the pleasant fairy walks of the
                     Vineyard in such a despondent manner—such dejection of spirits, that the other
                     fairies could not but remark it. Some of the sympathizing ones pitying her
                     greatly, at last asked her about her trouble, thinking they might possibly
                     assist her, though she was their superior. She confided in them; whereupon they
                     advised her to ask counsel of the queen of all the fairies that were then on
                     the island.
                  So in a little time thereafter Ariel approached Titania, saying
                     beseechingly:—
                  "Good mother queen, with what mortal of the earth am I to be blessed?"
                  Titania answered:—
                  "Daughter, it is well you have come to me. I have seen and known and sorrowed
                     with you in your trouble, but it was not permitted me to speak until after you
                     should make the first approach to the subject. How gladly would I have relieved
                     you were not our laws so inexorable! How gladly would I now were it not for the
                     same imperative reason, but I can say something and perhaps may
                     assist you greatly. I will disclose to you all that is permitted. Our laws will
                     not permit me to impart the secret which so nearly affects your welfare; that
                     you must discover for yourself; but what I can disclose may be of much
                     assistance in directing your thoughts towards the discovery of the being of
                     earth without whose acquaintance you cannot accomplish your destiny as a fairy,
                     and would, in consequence, be miserable forever."
                  "I have felt it," said the golden-haired beauty, drearily.
                  Titania proceeded:—
                  "Yes, it could not be otherwise; your nature being kindly and imperishable. But
                     we will talk of the main subject; words about immortality only, necessarily
                     being of but slight consequence to us fairies who are immortal. What have you
                     thought most about lately?"
                  "Why, about the happy mortal with whom I am to communicate, of course. I told
                     you, mother."
                  "Yes! yes! I remember. Don't wonder at my repetition of a question, but attend
                     to what I say. I know what I am about and shall do the best that I can for you.
                     What have you thought about the mortal? You have never had any notion as to
                     what sort of person it is to whom you, as good angel, are to minister?"
                  "Not the least. O tell me where to find her."
                  "Nay! nay! Have I not said it is not permitted? The great Oberon, your father,
                     would be very angry and punish me severely if I should." Titania now laughed as
                     she continued: "But what a simple little fairy it is! I wonder if she be really
                     my daughter?"
                  Ariel patted her mother's lips softly with the palm of her ruby hand; the
                     female fairy way of kissing a female fairy.
                  Titania lovingly returning the caress, again continued:—
                  "Whence comes the power that our Ariel can ride so easily and daintily on the
                     sea foam but from her own thought—her own will? She has but just said that she
                     has no notion what sort of person is to be her Savior, and yet in the next
                     breath declares her sex."
                  "But O! good mother queen! is it really true? is it a woman?"
                  "Ariel has spoken. She is a very handsome, stately girl. You have just now
                     thought it, or I could not speak it for you."
                  Ariel appeared perplexed as she answered:—
                  "Yes!" Then she asked:—
                  
                  "Where is she? O! I want to find her."
                  Titania answered but a single word. That word was:—
                  "Think! Ariel!"
                  Again Ariel appeared perplexed, musing some little time before she spoke. At
                     last she inquired:—
                  "Is it a person of distinction?"
                  "My daughter has said it," confirmed the fairy queen.
                  "An Indian princess?" now quickly and eagerly queried the buoyant little
                     fairy.
                  "Certainly! an Indian princess," gladly and fondly smiled the queen.
                  "O, yes! yes! I know now. But where is she? I must also know that, or the most
                     secret bowels of the earth will not be remote enough to hide my misery."
                  Titania continued to smile. She knew now that her young daughter's trouble
                     would soon be dispelled. As once before, she answered but a single word, very
                     impressively spoken:—
                  "Think! Ariel!"
                  Ariel bowed her head, but immediately raised it again; when the mother marveled
                     that the glory transfiguring her countenance outshone that of her hair as she
                     answered:—
                  "Yes! yes! I know all now. She dwells in that land which is called Virginia by
                     those strange men of the earth who have so lately arrived on these pleasant,
                     happy shores. O! bless you! bless you! dear, good mother queen!"
                  Titania embraced Ariel after the most tender manner in which female fairies
                     embrace, confirming:—
                  "You are right, dearest and best. Go and fulfill your destiny."
                  "Yes! yes! happy mother queen," replied Ariel, "I know, and you may not tell me
                     her name, nor describe her personal appearance further than I have thought
                     it?"
                  "No, I may not," said Titania.
                  "But," continued Ariel, happy beyond all expression, "I shall know her when I
                     see her."
                  "Yes, my Princess, you will know her when you see her."
                  Ariel departed from the presence of the fairy queen with the lightest and most
                     airy of fairy steps, and it being yet early in the evening she proceeded,
                     guided by her Thought, at once to the seaside, where,
                     fortunately, the wind blowing off shore a good stiff breeze, she seated herself
                     on the crest of the surface "drift" on the ocean water, and was soon wafted to
                     the mouth of the James River. Reaching there with the rising tide she rode in
                     on the upward "flow" and soon set her dainty feet on the ground
                     in the realms of the great Indian king, Powhatan.
                  Proceeding with unerring certainty, as her newly acquired fairy knowledge
                     instructed her, she soon found the wigwam, and soon gained the side of the
                     royal couch whereon Pocahontas reclined, sleeping. Perching her diminutive
                     little figure in the cup of the young Princess' ear, she sang an exultant,
                     grateful, happy lullaby; and what she sang the beautiful, sweet young Indian
                     girl dreamed.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *It may seem to some from the manner in which she introduces the dream,
                        and from other similarities with Spenser, that Lucy plagiarises portions
                        of the Faerie Queene, but such cannot possibly be the
                        case, because I know, absolutely, that this gifted young writer of "The
                        Golden Fairy" had not read the Faerie Queene, nor ever got
                        an inkling of its contents, or any portion thereof, until years had
                        passed away after the paper was written.
                     Though the name of Gloriana is introduced in "The Golden Fairy," I know
                        she only had it from casual mention. In fact, I am well enough acquainted
                        with her moral predilections to be able to say, that, had she read
                        Spenser previous to writing her fairy tale, she would certainly have
                        given greater prominence to so fine a character as his Faerie
                           Queene. N. S. R. B.
                  
               
               
                  And this was Pocahontas' dream:—
                  A gallant young stranger had come from the East—from over the water, a great
                     way off, to her father's opulent kingdom. His compatriots called him Captain
                     John Smith. He was endeavoring to found a little colony in Virginia. He had
                     incurred the hatred of Powhatan, the lord of the fair land. Powhatan's braves
                     beleaguered him. They took him prisoner, and adjudged his life a sacrifice. The
                     stately, generous Princess laid her head on his at the block—she offered her
                     life for his and saved him.
                  Again:—Many times, and often, was the gallant captain's little colony near
                     starving. As often, the beautiful Princess, named Pocahontas, sent him bright,
                     hard, golden corn, supplying his needs, giving bounteously and bountifully of
                     her riches, and saving to life one of the hopes of a continent.
                  Thus dreamed, and afterwards did, Pocahontas, fourteen years old; sweet,
                     virgin, noble daughter of a king proud, haughty, and powerful as him who sat on
                     the English throne.
                  History says that that dream has been verified in the past in actual life.
                     Washington, Jefferson and Monroe, proud John Randolph, every and all, stately sons of
                     stately old Virginia, speak from the Spirit World in laudation of the glorious
                     Golden Fairy, Charity, or Benevolence.
                  And that was what Ariel did with her corn at that time.
                  As to what mortal she communed with after the departure of Pocahontas to the
                     Better Land, I can say, that long years ago a fair young Quaker girl of placid,
                     sweet countenance, who resided in the land of Penn, once said in reply to an
                     inquiry made by a gay young lady friend of the world who was visiting her:—
                  "Thee does not know; but my assurance is perfect that the bounty of the kind
                     Indians towards our people is unlimited. Many of our people are in lonely
                     seclusion in the woods, far away here on the sweet flowing Schuylkill, and
                     often, when commencing, have hard times to get along, but the good Indians are
                     our friends and never allow us to suffer for food. Their maize fields are open
                     to us as to themselves."
                  And after that—when the fair young Quaker girl grew into old age, died, and was
                     laid to sleep with the rest—as to what Ariel did after that—it at present lies
                     sleeping in the land of Myths.
                  It is possible I may at some future time again visit the Fairy Queen under the
                     Big Thorn Tree in father's pasture lot, where she calls occasionally, and learn
                     something more concerning my heroine of Fairy Land.
                  
                     Your friend, LUCY.

               IX.
               THE VALUE OF AN OLD NEGRESS, EIGHTY-SEVEN YEARS OLD, AT THE CLOSE OF
                  THE REBELLION.
               
                  I.
                  "O MAUD! see there! see! see! see quickly! see Chester and his men chasing the
                     rebels! O how hard they do try to catch them, and how they do run! They will
                     surely overtake them! Yes! yes! Now they are catching hold of them! Hurrah!
                     hurrah! for brave Chester and our brave Union soldiers!"
                  The young lady, or girl, or child, as her language imports, who spoke, was one
                     of a bevy of a dozen blooming girls gathered together on the veranda or balcony
                     extending along in front and over the main entrance door to Pardon Peters'
                     store in their native little country village. She was Emma Peters, Pardon
                     Peters' only child and sole heiress.
                  In her enthusiasm she forgot time and place, and thought it an actual skirmish
                     on the battle-field—she forgot her sex, and cheered, as I have recorded, as a
                     man cheers:—
                  "Hurrah! hurrah! for brave Chester, and our brave Union soldiers!"
                  While she was speaking, the intense interest she felt in the spectacle she was
                     looking down upon in the street, and the warm feelings that had been
                     particularly enlisted in the welfare of one of the young men there under her
                     gaze, caused her to quiver through her entire system, both physical and
                     emotional, with intense and happy excitement. Every inch of her five feet two
                     inches in height was alive and vibrating to her thoughts with joyous emotion
                     and simple exultation.
                  
                  The rapt and absorbed gaze she cast upon the young men who had just rushed in
                     true "helter-skelter" style into her and her companions' view, illumined her
                     countenance with the air of transfiguration. Her soul was so entirely absorbed
                     in the scene and in the triumph of the cause, and in one of the young men, that
                     she appeared as if glorified—glorified through the purity and exaltedness of
                     the thoughts that had stimulated her emotions to such a pitch of intensity.
                  Maud Dimond, the girl addressed, scarce older than the speaker, who was only
                     sixteen, stood partly facing the young enthusiast. A girl who never lost her
                     self-control, nor the command of her surroundings, she was quick to perceive
                     that the rapt manner of her friend—for such she was in the sweetest sense of
                     that sweet name—was attracting the attention of the other girls in the
                     group.
                  Careful of her welfare as of her own, she bent toward her, whispering: in order
                     to break the spell that had mastered her consciousness:—
                  "Emma! how handsome you are when you forget yourself and let your thoughts run
                     away with you!"
                  Emma blushed deeply as the words awakened her from her trance. She knew her one
                     failing—or was it a virtue—when anything particularly noble, and that she
                     loved, enlisted her thoughts and her sympathies. And so she now knew that she
                     had allowed her admiration and her love for Chester and the Union cause to
                     possess her mind to the exclusion of collected reason, until she had almost
                     made herself a subject of amusement to the young companions who could not
                     understand, or would not have understood her.
                  She whispered in reply:—
                  "I can't see what Chester—Chester so handsome, so good and so smart, could ever
                     find to like in my plain face and my woeful absent-mindedness. Sometimes it
                     doesn't seem possible to me when he is not with me that he should want me."
                  "O! he finds enough in you to like, and so do I," smiled Maud again in her
                     young friend's ear, and putting her arm around her and drawing her to her.
                  "Yes, he loves me. I know; but it makes me wonder."
                  The occasion for the foregoing conversation was the incipient training of a
                     company of young volunteers to fight for their country in the war of the
                     Rebellion—the great American Rebellion that, in years to come the youth of the
                     land will read about with shuddering awe. It was in those days in the struggle
                     when the war was so far advanced that mighty masses of men were moving in great
                     phalanxes to meet with awful shock. The skillful rebel general, the dreaded
                     Lee, was about to cross the Southern Pennsylvania border with an immense
                     invading host. The momentous, terrible battle of Gettysburg was impending. With
                     regard to the result all sorts of conjectures were rife. Perhaps Lee might win
                     the fight. The military chieftains for the Union were not perfectly confident
                     of hurling him back to the poorly cultivated Southern acres, where some
                     supposed he might be starved into surrender if he could be subdued in no other
                     way. If he should succeed in his first demonstration on Northern soil he might
                     then roll on to Philadelphia; and perhaps further north. Rochester was on the
                     road to the Rebel stronghold of Canada; perhaps he might yet sack Rochester and
                     desolate and lay waste the fair fields of Western New York. So feared and
                     talked women and the timid, even as far north as the waters of Ontario. Women
                     and the timid in many instances began to wear scared, anxious faces. The
                     country outside of military circles knew not what to dread. Those inside,
                     fearful Lee might win the first field in Pennsylvania, had not imparted
                     confidence. Should he win that first field, how many more might follow? How far
                     might he advance?
                  This was the cause for the calling together of the company of embryo soldiers
                     in the little village of S— on the immediate occasion concerning which I
                     write.
                  The company, (though it was so late in the contest,) formed with scarce an
                     effort about two weeks previously had unanimously elected Chester Dimond, the
                     youngest and only brother of Maud now remaining at home, its captain. He had
                     accepted the post at once and had now been diligently training his men for the
                     two weeks, and waiting for official confirmation of the choice they had made.
                     The heads of the military power, fearful of the menacing Lee, and desirous to
                     bring into the field as great a force as possible before he should encroach on
                     Pennsylvania, had taken measures so that Chester had received his commission on
                     the day antecedent to that on which he is introduced to the reader. Orders to report at
                     once at Elmira accompanied the commission.
                  Burning with ardor to serve his country, Chester had immediately called his
                     company together on the next day to go through with their military evolutions
                     for the last time in their native town; after which they were to proceed at
                     once to the place of general rendezvous.
                  Hence it was, that, taking Maud into the carriage, he had ridden down to the
                     village, some two miles from the old ancestral farm-mansion, and had there met
                     his men.
                  Having met them and marshalled them in order, they had, during two or three
                     arduous hours, explained by their movements some of the best portions of
                     Hardee's Manual, until now, near the close of the day, they had arrived at the
                     closing manœuvre in their programme of performances. This manœuvre, or exploit,
                     was the result of a thought of Chester's. It was got up on the spur of the
                     moment and the occasion, and had never before been acted on any of their days
                     of training.
                  His thought was a mimic skirmish, as on the battle field it is a stern reality,
                     to burst suddenly upon the astonished and admiring gaze of the spectators who
                     thronged the balconies, verandas, and open doorways lining the main street of
                     the village.
                  In consequence, some of the sober citizens of the place and vicinity consenting
                     to act the disreputable role of rebels for the occasion, had dressed themselves
                     in the regulation gray and butternut, and had fiercely met the dashing
                     onslaught of the gallant company of Union men.
                  The counterfeit rebels held their ground well at first, but the patriotism, the
                     enthusiasm, and the superior vim of the Union
                     soldiers soon overpowering them, they turned and fled. Fleeing along the side
                     street in which the fray commenced, they soon arrived at the corner with the
                     main street on which was Mr. Peters' store, turned it, pell-mell—Chester and
                     his company in hot, eager pursuit—and burst suddenly into the view of the
                     bright eyes owned by the group of girls in the balcony.
                  The mimic melee was a piece of boys' play, certainly; nevertheless, the boys of
                     the village, and of the country for miles around discovered in it a bountiful
                     fund of amusement and instruction; and the girls, as has been seen, were
                     anything but listless, disinterested spectators.
                  Arrived now at the introduction again, I will proceed in the regular simple
                     style adopted by the multitude who tell their simple stories in the simple
                     papers.
                  Chester and his command speedily overpowered and disarmed the rebels in gray.
                     Driving them next—such as did not escape—into ward, and setting a sentry over
                     them, the labors and pastimes of the day were completed.
                  Filing, now, his soldiers into two compact columns, and deploying them to the
                     right and the left, facing the array of youthful, sparkling female faces
                     looking eagerly and admiringly down upon them from the balcony in front of Mr.
                     Peters' store, Chester sprang upon a large dry goods box lying convenient, and
                     spoke:—
                  "Attention! Soldiers!"
                  Then, after the proper pause:—
                  "Salute! Officers!"
                  Again:—
                  "Attention! Soldiers!"
                  And again:—
                  "Salute! Ladies!"
                  The girls courtesied sweetly in acknowledgment.
                  It was well done. Chester spoke again:—
                  "Soldiers! The ladies smile on us. Let us so act when we meet the foe in the
                     southern country as to deserve their smiles.
                  "Soldiers! The ladies are about to present us with a pledge of their trust in
                     our bravery and willingness to fight in their defence. Let us accept the trust,
                     sternly resolved to keep it, if need be, with the last drop of our blood. This
                     is the only way in which a Republic, under whose fostering protection their, as
                     well as our, honor, liberties and rights are safe, can live."
                  The embryo soldiers cheered.
                  Emma, accompanied by Maud, and properly supported by the remainder of the bevy
                     of girls, advanced to the front of the balcony and extended to Chester the end
                     of a flag staff, from the other extremity of which there floated in the breeze
                     an ingeniously wrought, rich silken banner.
                  He received it from her white hand with a chivalric inclination. Maud
                     spoke:—
                  "Young men of S—, our friends! We place our lives, our liberties, and our honor
                     in your keeping! We trust in you!
                     Whenever you look at our banner, we ask you to remember us—to never let the foe
                     come to us—to protect us, and your, and our friends and kindred from them.
                        Be brave, true, and loyal!"
                  Unconsciously, because it was in her nature, she adopted the language and the
                     sentiment of chivalry.
                  She spoke with kindly invitation and grand impressiveness, as only girls whose
                     souls are lofty by nature can speak. Her words and her manner electrically
                     fired the hearts of her young townsmen with enthusiastic admiration for her
                     sex.
                  They shouted; their spirits overflowing with the very abandon of zealous
                     enthusiasm, filling all the wide welkin with their manly music; it was such a
                        "hurrah" as no people on the earth but Americans can
                     raise:—
                  "Hurrah! hurrah!! hurrah!!! for Maud and Emma and the girls behind them.
                     Hurrah! hurrah!! hurrah!!! Three times three! and a hurrah! We can fight for
                     such girls as long as we can lift a gun from the ground."
                  And many of them did, afterwards. Ah! how brave, and hopeful, and joyous! how
                     strong, and active, and manly they went forth! In a few years a little remnant
                     came back; weary, worn, and torn; shorn of their pride and their strength;
                     their manhood nearly beaten out of them; beauty so seldom appeals to chivalry
                     in vain.
                  Maud and Emma wept bitter tears when they saw their broken soldiers gathered on
                     the church green at the close of the war; and when those soldiers saw those
                     tears they were not sorry they had suffered.
                  After the enthusiasm had subsided somewhat Chester tendered the banner he had
                     received from the hands of the young Emma, to their standard bearer, Orson
                     Lindsay.
                  Lindsay received the soft silken symbol that the company accepted in token of
                     their allegiance to the commands of beauty and worth, with a polite inclination
                     in keeping with the spirit that ruled the hour, but with an undercurrent of
                     selfish thought favorable only to himself, remarking inaudibly, and to
                     himself:—
                  "It shall go hard with all of us but you shall also give me your hand before
                     the war is over."
                  His secret reflection, on which much of the interest of the story hinges, and
                     to be explained by and by, referred to Emma Peters.
                  The banner that he received with perfect politeness and proper spirit was
                     ultimately elected in the regiment of which Chester's command became a part,
                     and was carried by Lindsay by the side of the national flag until near the
                     close of the war.
               
               
                  II.
                  The reader has doubtless divined from what he said to himself on receiving the
                     banner that Lindsay busied his mind somewhat with regard to Emma. Such was the
                     truth. He thought about her a great deal.
                  Had his secret desires been generally known to the young people of the town it
                     would have been matter of wonder to them that the elegant, stylish,
                     handsome-featured Orson Lindsay, heir to a competency, should allow his
                     thoughts to wander with any serious intention towards the plain, unpretending
                     Emma Peters, wealthy as she was prospectively. There was not a girl within a
                     circle of ten miles that feared her as a rival with any young man that she
                     regarded as a desirable match. There was not a young man of her acquaintance,
                     Chester included, but would have said, if asked:—
                  "He has too much property of his own to ever think of as homely a girl as Emma
                     Peters," and yet Chester was more wealthy, and still-engaged to her. Human
                     nature discovers itself in some of its phases as a curious anomaly.
                  But they were not acquainted with his character. None understood him perfectly;
                     although many thought they did.
                  Though handsome, dashing, and apparently open and generous, he carried behind
                     his swarth, handsome features—features inherited perhaps from some Portuguese
                     grandmother—and his glittering, steely eyes, a brain that, if not capable to
                     search the profoundest of depths, was yet keen, crafty, and inordinately greedy
                     of wealth: and his heart, if his passions prompted, could, and would, be
                     vindictive, cruel, remorseless.
                  For such characters beauty always has her charms; but the allurements of wealth
                     are superior; and in this instance no doubt Lindsay inherited the
                        traits—intensified by the
                     maternal Portuguese cross—that prompted his remorseless ancestor while in the
                     pursuit of power, to assist to hunt the unfortunate Scottish queen to her
                     destruction. It is certain he preferred to bask in the eminently superior
                     personal attractions of Maud Dimond, to waiting in the very plain Emma's
                     presence, though her thoughts were as sweet and chaste, and she was as superior
                     morally as the more beautiful and brilliant girl; her heart being not unlike
                     that of the noble Una's which the old English author unfolds so
                     attractively.
                  These attractions had, however, comparatively but little weight with Lindsay.
                     The lure in the eyes of men of his character is oftener the golden bait—that
                     which has ruined so many men's souls, both in this connection and otherwise—and
                     for this he passed Maud by, and willed to possess her.
                  Emma was the sole daughter—the only child, of Pardon Peters, the richest man in
                     town; Maud was at the same time the most beautiful girl in town, in the county,
                     in fact, was also the daughter of a man quite wealthy for his class, but she
                     would get of that wealth but a thousand dollars at most; of this Lindsay had
                     taken pains to assure himself.
                  He preferred Maud, by far, but deliberating in his crafty, calculating mind, he
                     had, for the reasons assigned, decided, as such minds always decide when
                     similarly situated, that Emma was the girl to get—he had so decided without
                     really inquiring of his mind whether he could make himself agreeable to either;
                     and with him deciding meant pretty much the same as willing, he
                     being one of those determined men who had as yet, so far in life, ruled his way
                     in nearly everything. When he had decided he regarded the matter as settled;
                     after that he would move heaven and earth if necessary to accomplish his
                     purpose.
                  Such men are to be feared, and in a certain sense respected. You must respect
                     their power if it hang over you—you must respect it until you can abridge it,
                     or of course you will get crushed. Linsday having made up his mind, there was,
                     therefore, as will be seen, danger in store for Emma and those she loved.
                  But Linsday himself was not aware of this in the commencement. Himself did not
                     know, when, in his mind, he first appropriated the precious child to himself,
                     how soon the worst passions of his nature were to be awakened— awakened toward
                     her lover. He did not know, because, with all his cunning, he was yet
                     short-sighted. When he resolved to appropriate Emma and her prospective fortune
                     to his own uses he did not take into account that there might a soul more
                     generous than his, and a will equally determined, interest themselves also in
                     the same pursuit. He supposed that the way to her heart would for a long time
                     be open to any presentable caller, or no doubt he would sooner have attempted
                     to explore its chaste recesses.
                  Foolish in this, like many other young schemers, he had not imagined that so
                     young, and particularly so homely a girl could inspire gentle, affectionate
                     feelings in the heart of any young man of sufficient consequence for her to
                     accept.
                  And so, when the girl was about fifteen, and he commenced his demonstrations,
                     showing her attentions and particular civilities as opportunity offered, he had
                     not thought to find the rich field of her heart sowed with choice seeds that
                     had already germinated and were up-springing into bloom and beauty—he had not
                     thought to be opposed. He therefore pursued his way in easy confidence for
                     about a year, occasionally surprising the girl with some advance of a tender
                     sort, not remarkable enough to merit repulse, but which still should be of
                     counting weight if remembered when the time should arrive—he pursued his way in
                     easy confidence until just before the call to the seat of war, confident of
                     success whenever he should choose to make open, bold siege, when he overheard
                     an important conversation between Chester and herself which instructed him that
                     the young couple had been pledged to one another for nearly two years.
                  He was "dumbfounded," as the expression goes in that locality. Relying
                     implicitly on his faith in her homeliness to keep the young men at a distance
                     he had not suspected such a state of affairs to be possible. Nor had there been
                     any outward visible signs to give him reason. Chester and Emma had allowed
                     their love to glide on, after they had acknowledged themselves to one another,
                     in a smooth, deep, even, unsuspectable stream. No one would have suspected an
                     attachment between them, fervent as it was on the part of both, they had been
                     so quiet and undemonstrative before others. Even the visits usual between
                     lovers had been made in a manner not to arouse the suspicions of others.
                  
                  Chester visited Emma often, to be sure, but the Dimonds and the Peterses had
                     always been very friendly, visiting back and forth often, and now as Maud
                     always accompanied him when he called to see her, and as he seldom drove out
                     with Emma unless both girls were in the carriage with him, young Lindsay, nor
                     any one else, had any particular cause to think they were affianced. In fact,
                     no one besides Maud and her mother, and the sweet girl's own parents, knew, or
                     suspected the thoughts they cherished for one another, until Linsday overheard
                     the conversation alluded to.
                  Then, he was "dumbfounded." He was angered, too; bitterly. He had
                     so certainly appropriated her to himself when she should be of suitable age to
                     marry that it awakened his worst, revengeful passions to learn that she already
                     belonged to another. And of course then, in agreement with his wicked nature
                     and his unbending will he began directly to weave wicked plans in his crafty,
                     cruel brain to circumvent the successful lover and get possession of the girl
                     and her coveted fortune; and hence when receiving the banner from her fair hand
                     only Chester intervening, he had said to himself without feeling a pang of
                     remorse, while a volume of suppressed rage, chagrin and hate burned in his bad
                     heart:—
                  "It shall go hard with all of us, but you will also give me your hand before
                     the war is over."
                  He meant all of that reflection.
                  If acceptable opportunity presented, this modern Paynim would not, other means
                     failing, hesitate to sacrifice any life that might bar his way. And knowing now
                     there was a life in his way, he would certainly exert his best endeavor to make
                     such opportunity if he should deem it necessary; and he anticipated it would
                     be.
                  He was discerning enough, and had learned enough of Emma during the intercourse
                     of a lifetime, to perceive, and was well enough acquainted with Chester's
                     character to know, that nothing but death could keep them asunder after their
                     affections had become enlisted for one another. He knew that a Dimond never
                     yielded any more than himself would, and that it would be no light matter to
                     cheat one of them of his dearest hopes. Therefore, in his heart, Chester Dimond
                     had already received his doom.
                  And, on the other part, when the time came for them to say good-bye, the young
                     lovers, though both of them had learned a great deal of his crafty brain and
                     treacherous heart during their many years of intercourse at the schoolhouse and
                     at social gatherings, yet, open and generous themselves, had not divined how
                     treacherous he really might be. Chester, because not knowing it, was at the
                     mercy of a merciless villain.
                  After he had bidden adieu to his friends and his love, who bravely cheered him
                     on, and had taken the cars for Elmira, he had in his command, without knowing
                     it all, one man who had the heart of a devil, and that heart guided by a brain
                     that overflowed with a devil's cunning; and that cunning already plotting
                     perseveringly and chiefly against himself.
                  Arrived in Elmira, Chester's command was immediately sent to an important point
                     further south to relieve some troops older in the service who might be useful
                     in the impending battle that was now sure to be fought at some locality in
                     Pennsylvania. Lee was over the border.
                  On the way south Orson Lindsay's scheming brain was busy exploring for material
                     with which to make feasible his desire to thwart the loves of Chester and Emma.
                     He thought persistently and almost constantly, striving to devise some plan by
                     which he might separate them and accomplish his desire without resorting to
                     extreme measures; but, as he had anticipated, think as seriously as he might
                     his thoughts could trace out but one sure method. To this method
                     they at last constantly reverted; and so before arriving at Philadelphia he had
                     fully resolved that Chester must die.
                  Before arriving in Philadelphia he came to meditate so grave a sin—so black a
                     crime with complacency, and hourly. That it concerned one whom he should have
                     regarded as a friend did not affect him in the least. He never cherished a real
                     affection; unless for his mother.
                  And otherwise; his nerves were so strong and so true, and his powerful will so
                     completely dominant over his consciousness that he hourly met Chester and his
                     companions in arms with his usual smiling, handsome face, and all his usual
                     self-centred self-collectedness.
                  Whenever I think of him my thoughts unavoidably call to mind the smooth,
                     polished, plausible Lucifer of Byron's Cain, or the Mephistopheles of
                     Faust.
                  
                  He was smooth, secret, wicked, undetectable, and devoid of conscience as
                     Satan.
                  Are you surprised that a young man who had always previously lived a passably
                     fair life should suddenly develop such remarkable depths of turpitude in his
                     heart? There are such anomalies. Sometimes a young man during all the precious
                     time of his youth, avoiding vice only because it is condemned and shunned by
                     his companions, and practicing only the negative virtues, his heart not
                     aspiring as high as even these, is slowly and surely preparing his mind to act
                     in just this manner, if temptation shall ever come; and it usually does.
                     Practicing none of the active virtues, he has been, during all his youth,
                     making his heart cold and cruel, and steeling it, perhaps unconsciously to
                     himself, against the entrance of the gentler human sympathies. His mind
                     becomes, in a manner, a sort of fallow land, and in such natures as Lindsay's
                     the soil is always deep and strong.
                  
                     Satan always stands ready to sow vice in strong fallow land.
                  Orson Lindsay's heart, had, in some just such manner been kept fenced in and
                     plowed and deflowered of all goodness by the devil as fast as it sprung up, if
                     there was ever any that germinated in it, until now he scattered on the tares
                     in broad handfuls and they were acceptably received in the congenial, rank,
                     poisonous soil.
                  So, what wonder, if, as the result of his diabolic reflections, when he reached
                     Philadelphia, he sought and easily found, as persons of his disposition always
                     can, one of those disreputable physicians, of whom all large cities are cursed
                     with a plentiful stock, who willingly sell their knowledge and their services
                     to the most infernal of purposes, if liberally paid? No wonder at all.
                  Lindsay sought, discovered, and communicated with an M. D. of
                     this description.
                  Of this physician he purchased, in pursuit of his diabolic scheme, a tiny phial
                     containing three or four drops of one of the most secret, subtle, surely deadly
                     poisons known in, or out of, the Pharmacopœia—a poison that would do its work
                     in less than twelve hours and leave no trace of its presence in the human
                     system.
                  The poison he designed, of course, as a safe agent to be used when opportunity
                     presented, if other means had previously viously failed to remove Chester from
                     his way. Another agent, and on which he relied principally—if Chester should
                     not sooner be stricken opportunely down by the enemy—as it might be safely used
                     in the heat of action on the battle field, was one of the best of revolvers
                     which he had purchased and now carried constantly in his belt. The knife he
                     also carried, but did not suppose he should meet with convenient, safe chance
                     to use it; nevertheless, he carried it in order to be prepared in every way; he
                     meant to be sure.
                  Thus prepared, when the day came, he grasped the standard presented by the
                     pure-minded Emma in token of the good will and hopes of the ladies of their
                     town, and marched gaily and with smiling face under the unsuspicious Chester's
                     command, on to Southern soil.
               
               
                  III.
                  The company of volunteers from S— had not been long in the Southern country
                     when one of the opportunities now so eagerly desired by Lindsay in which to
                     consummate his fell purpose, presented itself.
                  The company was drawn up with its regiment in battle array in front of the foe.
                     The order came for the regiment to charge at the double-quick.
                  Chester gave the word, and his men, following him close, sprang gallantly into
                     a galling fire from the enemy. They were so eager and so quick to obey the
                     command that every man sprang ahead in advance of Lindsay. Quick as a flash of
                     thought, every faculty alert and watchful, he seized the much coveted
                     opportunity.
                  He drew his revolver from his belt, presented it to the back of Chester's head
                     about twenty feet in advance, and fired. The young captain fell at the flash
                     from the explosion. Lindsay believed him killed and did not fire a second
                     time.
                  But Chester was, really, unharmed. The ball from the pistol, instead of
                     striking his head as Lindsay designed it should, had but just grazed his
                     temple; the concussion being so great and striking so sensitive a place in the
                     skull it easily knocked him down.
                  
                  Chester, when the blow came, also thought his final hour was come. The side of
                     his head felt as if it had been plowed open with a cold iron rod bored across
                     it, and deep in. He thought it was all torn open to the brain. Yet, he sprang
                     to his feet again instantly, raised his hand to the seared temple, and felt for
                     the wound; there was none; he withdrew the hand and examined it for blood;
                     there was no blood to be seen, then he rushed on with his command and serenely
                     directed his men until the battle was ended.
                  Three or four years afterward, when he learned who had fired the shot, he
                     remarked that he thought at the time the ball came from behind, but still could
                     not believe it possible; he more thought that so many balls from the enemy,
                     flying thick in the faces of himself and men had disturbed his self-possession
                     a little.
                  Lindsay thought that the hurry and excitement resulting from the dash towards
                     the enemy and the general turmoil necessarily incident to the engagement, would
                     screen his deadly endeavor, so nearly successful, of trying to pistol his
                     captain; but he was mistaken. The treacherous movement was observed by the man
                     on his right, who, while rushing into the fight, missing his dilatory colors,
                     had glanced obliquely back over his shoulder to learn what was become of the
                     man who bore them. Just at the instant his gaze rested on Lindsay the pistol
                     was discharged. Unavoidably and accurately noting the direction of the aim he
                     knew the result it had accomplished. Had not Chester risen again instantly
                     after his fall, he would have been speedily avenged. This man was his very warm
                     friend. He had already drawn his rifle on Lindsay, when, seeing Chester rise
                     directly and spring again unharmed toward the enemy, he stayed his purpose, and
                     waited.
                  He waited until the battle was over.
                  In the evening, when they were bivouacked for the night, he made plausible
                     pretext to draw Lindsay away from the encampment of fatigued soldiers to near
                     the sentry line. Getting him to himself he addressed him point-blank as his
                     reputation for straightforwardness and bluntness of speech warranted him to
                     do.
                  He said:—
                  "Orson Lindsay, I don't know that you meant to kill Captain Dimond
                     to-day. You may have fired your pistol at the enemy but it may be
                     as well for you to remember that hereafter I shall keep an eye constantly upon
                     you while we are in action."
                  Lindsay replied with some warmth and a tone of surprise:—
                  "You do me a great injustice with your ungenerous suspicions. I fired my
                     revolver at the tall rebel captain who was so far in advance of his men. Why
                     should I desire to harm Chester, our playmate at school for so many years?"
                  "Certainly! why should you! I cannot say; and therefore I shall not speak to
                     him about it; but you will remember that hereafter it will be unavoidable that
                     I watch you."
                  "It is very unfortunate," urged Lindsay, "that you should think my pistol
                     knocked Captain Dimond down, but I suppose I must bear your unjust
                     suspicions."
                  "Orson Lindsay!" said the other, now speaking harshly and sternly, "I
                        know the ball from your revolver made that level, livid streak
                     across Captain Dimond's temple, but as I do not know to a
                     certainty that you meant it for him, I shall not speak about it; but I shall
                     most certainly watch you after this. I now believe you to be
                        dangerous. I have no more to say to you."
                  He turned contemptuously and stalked away, six feet of alert, scornful
                     manliness and indignation; Lindsay gazing after him with eyes that shot forth
                     baleful fires.
                  He kept his word and did not disclose the circumstance of the pistol shot until
                     the war was over and until after he had learned concerning a second nearly
                     successful attempt made by Lindsay on the life of the man he was determined to
                     destroy; but that he warned Lindsay doubtless saved Chester's life on many
                     subsequent occasions when they were in the heat of strife with the enemy. He,
                     too, was to be feared and respected.
                  He doubtless saved Chester's life on many subsequent occasions, because Lindsay
                     was determined, and there is no place that can offer more convenient and
                     fast-recurring, numerous facilities for murder, than the horrid battle field in
                     the midst of the terrific din created by thronging thousands who are all
                     intensely absorbed in the dire contention.
                  But hereafter, Lindsay dared not avail himself of any of those numerous
                     facilities to accomplish his fell design. He knew that the friend of Chester
                     whose suspicions—more than
                     suspicions—he had awakened, was a man that meant all he said, and was therefore
                     to be respected.
                  Hence, Chester, unscathed by, and unaware that he had, a secret foe, led his
                     gallant company through all their many imminent perils, running through many
                     scenes of strife and carnage, until he fought his final desperate fight at
                     Cedar Creek up the verdant valley of the Shenandoah.
                  And during all the time—all through those fateful scenes—Lindsay has kept
                     closely with the company, always carrying the banner, the revolver, the knife,
                     and the little phial, and has sustained without being suspected, the two
                     characters he planned and prescribed to himself while on the road from his
                     native town of S— to the Southern country. And in acting those two characters,
                     though I have not before intimated it, his duplicity and double-dealing
                     extended further and embraced other objects than Chester Dimond and the wealth
                     of Emma Peters.
                  You could expect no less of him. The man who can deliberately plan the death of
                     the playmate of his boyish years for no other object than a few handsful of
                     gold, readily lends his soul to other purposes equally base in the same
                     pursuit. So had Lindsay done. At the outset, almost before leaving
                     Philadelphia, he placed himself in communication with spies and other
                     emissaries of the rebel power. From the first, he acted secretly, in collusion
                     with such people, constantly selling information and receiving such pay
                     therefor as he could get, until the last great blow was struck at Richmond and
                     there was no longer a market for his perfidy.
                  Secret, possessed of wonderful, yes, marvelous tact and self-possession, brave
                     as the bravest hero, a good fighter, and always openly striking good, heavy
                     blows for the Union—his companions, and particularly the friend of Chester's
                     already introduced, knew him to strike down many a secessionist with his handy
                     revolver—he was never suspected of walking in tortuous ways by Chester and his
                     friends. His apparently open conduct misled all who were about him with regard
                     to his true character. He pursued his secret, treacherous course with impunity;
                     with no conscience to care which side should conquer in the contest so long as
                     he made money.
                  So is it often in seasons of national distress with an unprincipled, and also
                     fearless, intelligent man who makes wealth and the power it can command, his
                     idols and his only gods. He may do a great deal of mischief.
                  But if, in his collusion with the rebel power Lindsay had tapped a mine that
                     ran gold into his pocket a Pactolian stream, and if he also knew himself
                     watched by the friend of Chester, still, he had not thought of relinquishing
                     his design on the life of the young Union Captain, and ultimately on the
                     fortune of the girl that Captain loved—his chief desire was still to kill
                     Chester. If now he could have controlled millions he would still have retained
                     this desire if only because it had once been an original settled purpose.
                  Hence, in pursuit of this his main object, when the battle of Cedar Creek
                     transpired, he had been in the Shenandoah valley long enough, and had become
                     acquainted with the locations of some of the worst characters residing there.
                     This, as it proved afterwards, would, if no other agencies had intervened, have
                     been of considerable consequence in the consummation of his bloody ultimate
                     designs.
                  At the battle of Cedar Creek, Chester, still unwounded, led the remnant of his
                     company, now numbering less than twenty-five, into the battle as he had
                     formerly done on many other fields. Lindsay and the friend mentioned were among
                     the number, and also unharmed.
                  Early in the day in that terrible fight, when the Union men were being so
                     disastrously routed and slaughtered, Chester, bravely trying to stem the tide
                     of flight, received a terrible wound from a musket ball in the fleshy part of
                     the thigh. After being hit he strove a little time to keep his feet; but in
                     vain. The blood flowed fast; his leg felt as if palsied; he was soon compelled
                     to recline on the grass and with feelings of deep sorrow see his men flee past
                     closely pursued by the vindictive rebels.
                  One of his men, the friend who had already served him so well, unwounded,
                     careful of his captain's welfare as his own, fell down at his side while the
                     roar of the battle was rolling fiercely over and past them.
                  Lindsay, seeing Chester down, also dropped in his tracks not more than a
                     hundred feet away. He too was wounded, but not seriously, having only the
                     fingers shot away from his left hand. He fell because he thought the time when
                     he should supplant Chester in the heart and fortune of Emma Peters was now near
                     by. He meant to stick to what he
                     regarded as his prey—Chester had been doomed so long in his mind he now
                     regarded him in this light—as the sleuth hound does to its quarry.
                  As soon as he had stretched himself upon the grass, he drew his light
                     dirk-knife from his pocket and opening it with his right hand and teeth
                     commenced, coolly, to trim the stumps of his mutilated fingers with it. After
                     having completed his surgical operation, cutting off the shreds of skin and
                     flesh nicely and smoothly, retarded but little by the copious flow of blood, he
                     next used his knife to cut a small, circular piece of sod from the turf beneath
                     him. The piece of sod he cut was in the form of a cone, the base being the
                     grassy surface, the apex in the earth underneath, distant the length of his
                     knife-blade. Removing the cone from the cavity it filled, he next proceeded to
                     pulverize its earthy portion into a very fine powder, carefully removing all
                     coarse substances that he could not easily crush.
                  This operation completed he brushed the powder carefully into the little hole
                     in the ground his knife had made. Then taking his canteen from his person he
                     poured water in and mixed a thick paste of mud. The mud mixed he scooped up a
                     portion with his right hand and plastered it thickly on the stumps of his
                     fingers. It effectually checked the streaming of the blood. Then drawing a
                     light handkerchief from his pocket that his neat habits compelled him to carry,
                     he folded it firmly over the mud, tied it there, and jumped to his feet.
                  The rebel rabble had now swept past in pursuit of the Union troops; Lindsay
                     walked to where Chester was lying and stood by him.
                  The faithful friend who had been so thoughtful as to fall by his side had
                     already torn his pants open and swathed the ugly wound in his thigh with a
                     bandage made from his own dirty shirt. It had checked much of the effusion of
                     blood.
                  Chester, seeing Lindsay come and stand by him, spoke faintly, saying:—
                  "Orson! why are you here? Is this the place for a man at such a
                     time?"
                  Lindsay held up his broken hand; its shortness could be plainly discovered
                     through the wrappings of the light handkerchief.
                  Chester continued: smiling faintly, but satirically:—
                  "Does a man like you leave the fight for that?"
                  "No!" replied Lindsay, quietly, "not particularly for that. I think it is
                     better to save a Union captain than to kill a rebel private; that's all."
                  Chester's companion gave the malevolent hypocrite a keen and savage look, but
                     he did not know but his bad purpose might have died out of his heart. He had
                     seen nothing since the day of the pistol shot to further awaken his suspicions.
                     Reticent by nature, and unwilling to throw away words, he did not speak.
                  Chester commanded as sharply as his faintness would permit:—
                  "Go and find the enemy, both of you! I shall do well enough. The blood has
                     ceased to flow and there are no bones broken."
                  They both refused; Lindsay saying further:—
                  "We will carry you to a house I visited not two days ago, where, though the
                     people may not be of our party, you will get good care. They are susceptible to
                     be influenced by feelings of kindness for the suffering."
                  Chester, when his fainting condition is considered, looked at him keenly; he
                     never had much faith in Lindsay's sympathies; why then should he recommend the
                     humanity of others, others whom he could have seen but a very few times at
                     most?
                  He queried:—
                  "How came you so well acquainted with such excellent people?"
                  "O, I go out foraging occasionally you know!"
                  "Yes, but however, I think if you will not leave me it would be better if I
                     could be got into the care of some of our folks.
                  "Go! go! again I say, in search of the enemy! I do not need you! I am not near
                     dying!"
                  He spoke earnestly and authoritatively; nevertheless, both men replied in
                     unison of language; but how different their hearts and intentions toward
                     him:—
                  "I will not until you are taken care of."
                  "Well then!" said Chester, accepting a decision he was powerless to change,
                     crippled as he was, "if I have lost my authority in that direction, I suppose
                     as the enemy is between us and our
                     men you had better carry me to the place you have mentioned, so that you may
                     find your regiment again as soon as possible."
               
               
                  IV.
                  Chester's consent to his removal being obtained they prepared at once to carry
                     him away. In furtherance of the design Lindsay tore from its staff the banner
                     presented by the young ladies of their town. Spreading it upon the ground, the
                     two young men raised Chester and laid him upon it. Using now the staff as a
                     sort of stiffener to which the wounded man might cling and keep his body rigid
                     the more easily and thus facilitate their carrying him, Lindsay under his
                     direction placed one end between his legs allowing the other to extend up over
                     his left shoulder.
                  Getting now a strap from a rifle lying convenient, the other man, wrapping the
                     banner around his legs and the staff, and using the strap around the whole,
                     securely bound all together with it just above the sufferer's knees. Being now
                     prepared, Lindsay inserting his one hand in the strap, the friend doubling and
                     grasping the corners of the banner at his head, and Chester himself clinging to
                     the upper end of the flag staff, they lifted their helpless burthen from the
                     ground and directed their steps toward the house designated.
                  It was more than four miles distant, and they were compelled by fatigue and
                     Chester's sufferings to halt many times on the way; but they arrived at last at
                     the place sought. The fatigue however, Lindsay regarded no more than he did
                     Chester's sufferings. A little weariness of arm was a matter of but slight
                     moment to him compared with the wounded man's fate. If the distance had been
                     ten miles, and he had been alone he would willingly have carried his captain
                     that far could he have been sure of accomplishing his cherished desire by the
                     means.
                  When the party had arrived at the rebel's house—a quiet and secluded place—the
                     people recognising Lindsay welcomed them with assiduous alacrity and
                     cheerfulness. Chester was admitted at once and prompt means taken to dress his
                     wound with tenderness and care.
                  But of his crippled condition Chester seemed to think less than of other
                     matters. His hurt was not the chief subject of his thoughts. They had no sooner
                     carried him into the house and laid him on a bed than he again ordered his men
                     to return to the fight. Again they refused to obey him until his wound should
                     be dressed; and again was he compelled to give tacit acquiescence to their
                     decision.
                  Aided by Lindsay and the man of the house the faithful friend washed and
                     dressed the mangled leg, then, having remarked there were three or four
                     respectable females about the retired premises, he silently grasped his
                     captain's hand, pressed it hard, and without further delay obeyed his oft
                     repeated orders. He believed that in the company of those respectable women
                     there could no possible danger be visited upon his friend by Orson Lindsay.
                  Lindsay also left the presence of his captain presently, but did not leave the
                     vicinity until after he had held an important conversation with its master, a
                     hard-featured, cold-eyed old fellow aged about sixty-five years.
                  Stepping out at the door and beckoning him away from his family after the
                     dressing of the wound was completed, Lindsay desired of him a private
                     audience.
                  "I shall have to take you to one of the out-houses," said the old rebel in
                     reply to his request. "There can be no real secrecy in a house as loosely
                     constructed and partitioned as this."
                  "Anywhere so that we can be secret," continued Lindsay.
                  "Come along then!" and the hard-headed old lord of his surroundings conducted
                     Lindsay to some horse, or cattle sheds that were standing near by.
                  When they had got to where the old rebel supposed they would not be overheard
                     he said, or commanded, abruptly:—
                  "So, now! what is it? We have not been acquainted a great while; but we know
                     one another well enough not to need to 'mince matters,' as you say up
                     North."
                  Said Lindsay: accepting the challenge and coming to the point at once:—
                  "You would do anything for the Confederate cause?"
                  "Yes, by God!" replied the old fellow, "anything! I hate the northern hounds
                     worse than the devil."
                  The old reprobate was outspoken. As intimated, they had come to an
                     understanding at some previous meeting and he could speak plainly; and besides, there is a sort of freemasonry in
                     evil as in other things, by means of which hearts may read and understand one
                     another.
                  Lindsay continued:—
                  "If that fellow with the bandaged leg, lying in the house there, should die, it
                     would be one out of your way. Do you think he will ever get well?"
                  "No!" said the old devil, with a horrid imprecation, "he will never get well! I
                     wish all his friends were as sure to die now, as he is."
                  "Are you sure?" queried Lindsay, cordially and sympathetically.
                  "Sure!! Can't I see death in his face I wonder?"
                  He spoke with diabolic significance.
                  "Here!" returned the other, "take this. It has some wonderful medicinal
                     properties."
                  He drew from inside his shirt over his breast the tiny little phial he had
                     purchased in Philadelphia and extended it to his companion. The congenial arch
                     villain received it, remarking:—
                  "Is it sure?"
                  "Sure as death!"
                  "To be taken all at once?"
                  "All at once. Or it may be diffused through half a dozen different
                     preparations. There is enough of the elixir of life in that little bijou of a
                     phial to cure twenty men of all the ills to which flesh is heir."
                  Lindsay smiled as pleasantly as if saying "sweet things" to the lady of his
                     love. He was in fact thinking of Pardon Peters' bank stock.
                  The hoary-headed old traitor questioned once more:—
                  "What traces or peculiarities of its action does it leave behind?"
                  "None at all. It is safe as the musket ball on the battlefield."
                  "All right! Old Molly shall take care of your friend tonight. You
                     know, of course, I wouldn't put one of my family upon it?"
                  "All right!" confirmed Lindsay, "Only don't have a failure."
                  "There shan't be any," said the abandoned old wretch, his eye gleaming and his
                     lip sneering.
                  Once more Lindsay put his hand to his bosom. He withdrew it clutching a roll of
                     greenbacks. They were the price paid for the information that had caused the
                     disastrous Union rout that morning;—remind me as often as you please that the
                     gallant Phil. Sheridan when riding on to the field later in the day, said:
                     "Boys! this never should have happened if I had been here." Well! after all, I
                     don't know but he might have prevented that completest of
                     surprises, if he could have been on the ground in time the evening
                     previous.
                  Lindsay's hand was filled with green-backs. He loved money; but thinking to
                     make "assurance doubly sure"—he was very much in earnest—he offered the bills
                     to his companion in villainy, saying as when he presented the little
                     phial:—
                  "Here! take these."
                  The old man glowered upon him instantly, the wrinkles in his face doubling and
                     spreading into satanic distortion. The offering seemed to age his face into
                     eternity, but his tall form rose and swelled into the full proportions it
                     carried in his youth. With all the air of an incensed Spanish grandee he
                     menaced the young man standing by him: wrath in voice and manner:—
                  "Damn you!" he raged, "Do you desire to insult me? Don't you know that a
                     gentleman never sells services, nor accepts money presents?"
                  There is a sort of character in the South—and perhaps more prevalent than some
                     may think, and which often passes for the refined gentleman too—of this
                     description. He draws a line of distinction between the acts of the
                     professional man when he sells his professional services for hire, and when he,
                     or some other sells other than such services. This traffic disgraces,
                        that exalts. The old Virginian was a character of this
                        description.*
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     *
                        Perhaps the character may also be discovered further
                        North.
                  
                  It is only a case of a hard-featured, but not originally and essentially bad
                     human-nature, developed, in one of its bents, into perversity—the perversion in
                     this instance extending to the extreme. He could draw his line of distinction,
                     and further than that, if those below that line incurred his anger they must
                     beware. The old villain, whose
                     intellect was fairly educated, and who prided himself on being chivalric,
                     generous, hospitable, courteous, polite; as much of a gentleman as any paladin
                     of old—and he was all that, among his friends—would, if he could, if any man,
                     or number of men incurred his wrath, his hate, make himself to him or them a
                     fiend in earnest. Where foes were concerned he would not scruple to use the
                     vilest and wickedest of means to accomplish his ends. His natural feelings,
                     essentially hard in the beginning, now completely calloused by education toward
                     those whom he adjudged to be socially beneath the gentleman—calloused toward
                     them in case they should incur his wrath, would, if he should adjudge a man of
                     that class to be dangerous to the things himself cherished, approve his own
                     hand to administer death as readily as if the offender were a bear or a wolf. A
                     "pack carrier" not subservient to him or his kind, and who incurred his wrath,
                     had better keep out of his way; and he regarded all Union men as "pack
                     carriers," or as their friends.
                  My explanation given I can now return to the conversation between the two
                     wretches.
                  When the old reprobate menaced him so fiercely and sharply, Lindsay at once
                     placated his resentment—his anger; he said:—
                  "No offense intended. I offer you the money as a loan from friend to
                     friend."
                  He did not expect to be believed; but he knew the transparent equivocation
                     would be accepted as an apology. It was; the wicked Virginian replying in his
                     ordinary tone of voice:—
                  "Thank you! but I do not desire to borrow. Let this end it. And you can
                     understand that your friend is in safe hands and will be cared for all the
                     same."
                  "All right!" again repeated Lindsay.
                  Nevertheless, the villains were to be thwarted.
                  They left the cattle sheds and separated; Lindsay proceeding to search for the
                     company of which he was a member, and to obtain surgical care for his shortened
                     hand.
                  They had not been long gone from the sheds when old black Mary, a superannuated
                     old negress, too old, too infirm, and too valueless to run away, and yet
                     withal, possessed of nearly as much shrewdness as her old reprobate master,
                     crawled out from under a manger where she had hidden at his first approach, and
                     rose as nearly erect as the abundance of her infirmities would permit, the
                     whitish pallor of fear mixing with and sicklying the coal black of her
                     complexion. The old crone had heard every word and well comprehended the drift
                     of the colloquy between the two villains.
                  Getting upon her feet she muttered fearfully to herself:—
                  "Fore de Lord! 'um done gone s'pec' Mass' Gird g'wine try fur to make 'um pisen
                     'im Mass' Linkum Ossifer. G'wine make 'um gib 'im leetle teenty tonty bottle
                     all long ob to-night. Den 'im die to-morrah. Wha' ole Moll—good fur nuffin ole
                     wench g'wine fur do? Gib hansum' Mass' Linkum Ossifer dat one leetle teenty
                     tonty bottle?—make 'im die? No! no! Ole Moll kin't do dat! Ole Moll won't do
                     dat! Sartin shuah!"
                  She slowly wagged her toothless old head, continuing:—
                  "But 'um stay wid Mass' Linkum Ossifer; 'cause Mass' Gird 'im say so, n'wha'
                     'im say ole Moll do—ole Moll hab do. 'Um t'ink when Mass' make 'um gwo in der
                     'um put mouf clos' Mass' Linkum Ossifer head 'n whispah 'n 'im nice w'ite eah',
                     'n 'um tell 'im eberyt'ing dem say, 'n den 'im say wha' ole Moll g'wine fur do.
                     'Um s'pec' 'im know. Dem Linkum folks mity smart. Know heap! 'Um know dat.
                     Mass' Gird 'im mity 'fraid ob dey. Ya's! 'Um tell Mass' Linkum Ossifer Mass'
                     Gird 'im done gone make 'um p'ison yo'. Den 'im t'ink, t'ink, t'ink! 'n bimeby
                     'im say wha' ole Moll g'wine fur do. Ya's! 'Um whispah 'n 'im w'ite eah."
                  When the time arrived old Moll whispered in the white ear and saved a life.
                  That evening, late, after he had made sure that the contents of the little
                     phial were mixed in some of the drinks and medicaments, some of which were
                     certain to be required by the suffering captain before morning, her master
                     called old Moll in and gave her her directions, subject to Chester's
                     command.
                  Then he left them together, the powerless young white man and the decrepid old
                     black woman, certain that before morning the powerful enemies of secession
                     would number one less among their ranks. He did not dream that his meditated
                     crime might be known. But Moll was no sooner alone with the Union captain than she whispered
                     her astounding information to his understanding. It was believed. If an
                     ignorant woman, her scared manner—her solicitude for his welfare, displayed
                     that earnest impressiveness which truth can alone impart, and which cannot be
                     gainsaid; and besides it was well known that the sympathies of her color were
                     universally friendly to the Union cause.
                  Chester was greatly surprised; and particularly at the duplicity and baseness
                     of Lindsay; but he was not at all daunted. He took time by the forelock,
                     directing the old negress to empty all the drinks and other preparations out at
                     the window at once, before the family should be settled into repose for the
                     night, as at this time the would-be-murderer would be less likely to overhear
                     any unusual movement and so suspect the thwarting of his and Lindsay's plan of
                        diablerie. He had all the liquid
                     preparations prepared by the old rebel and his family thrown away because he
                     knew he should require drink during the night and he thought it better not to
                     chance a possible mistake by placing with them anything which old Molly might
                     procure for him.
                  After the old negress had complied with his directions she came and sat by him.
                     Chester had been and was still busily thinking. He was endeavoring to make some
                     speedy conclusion as to what should be done, well knowing from the conversation
                     she had reported, that when her master learned the contents of the phial had
                     not wrought the desired deadly result he would most certainly resort to other
                     means to accomplish his evil purpose, unless forestalled.
                  He thought at first of communicating with the females of the house. But a
                     little reflection convinced him it would be better not—unless, indeed, his
                     extremity should become very desperate; in which event it might be tried—they
                     would not believe that the model gentleman, their own kind husband and father,
                     in which character only he had discovered himself to Chester, could meditate so
                     deep and dastardly a crime. Then he thought he might send old Moll out to
                     communicate with some of the rebel officers, but that plan was also soon
                     discarded; he was pretty certain, supposing she could get to them, that they
                     would not hearken to her; the story she would carry would need to invite an
                     advantage to them or their cause to get their attention, they so seldom
                     listened to people of her color and condition.
                  What could be done? At last, after revolving everything in his mind, Moll
                     seemed to be his only dependence, and how could she, aged, crippled, just ready
                     to step into the grave, communicate with his friends in time to save his life?
                     She could not. It was plain that with the rebels between him and them the
                     undertaking would be an absolute impossibility. Chester almost despaired, at
                     last, there appeared to be so little hope. He was so troubled and perplexed
                     with his difficulty—so nearly at his wits' end that he thought and spoke, half
                     aloud:—
                  "If only our men had whipped to-day the way would be plain enough."
                  Said old Moll suddenly and interestedly:—
                  "Wha's dat?"
                  "O! was I thinking aloud? I did not intend it. I was thinking if only the Union
                     soldiers and not rebels, were around here now," responded he.
                  "Yah! yah! Golly! 'Um understan'," chuckled the old negress. "Mass' Linkum
                     sojers, dem all roun' heah eb'rywha'. Dem done gone chase dey rebbles all 'way
                     ebber so fur."
                  "Is that true?" said Chester, his countenance lighting up, "how did you
                     learn?"
                  "Yuh! yuh! yah! Dis ole wench hark at de dooah. 'Um heah Mass' Gird tell Miss'
                     'n de young Misses fur sartin shuah dat Mass' Gen'ral Sherumdum 'im come 'n 'im
                     took de Linkum sojers, 'n 'im dribe de rebbles like de debble—dribe dey 'way
                     off, ebber, 'n ebber, 'n ebber so fur. Nebber come back! shuah!"
                  "Why did you not inform me of this before?"
                  "Dunno! Wuz g'wine to! S'pec' sah de p'ison scar' 'im all 'way f'um
                     good-fur-nuffin ole wench's head."
                  "Well Molly!" now said Chester with a light heart, "you must go at once and
                     find some of the Lincoln men and bring them here."
                  "Ya's Massa! 'Um g'wine d'rectly!"
                  After speaking, Old Moll stepped softly from the window with a cup in her hand.
                     In a few minutes she returned with the cup filled with sparkling, pure, spring
                        water— water that more than
                     rivalled the best Catawba. Setting it on the table in reach of Chester's hand,
                     she immediately said:—
                  "Good night! Massa Ossifer!"
                  "Good night, Molly! God bless you!" heartily responded the imperilled young
                     man.
                  And then the old negress hobbled out into the night to hobble her way slowly
                     and painfully along among the impeding rubble stone that encumber the valley,
                     until she should discover a Union picket.
                  Before the dawn of day Captain Chester Dimond was provided with a trusty guard
                     of three good men from the regiment of which he was a component part.
               
               
                  V.
                  Twenty-four hours were not expired from the time Lindsay left the wounded,
                     helpless Chester to the tender mercies of the merciless old rebel when his
                     wounded hand had procured him a furlough and he was speeding rapidly on his way
                     home. Impatient to hasten to his coveted fortune, he could not wait to learn if
                     the plot against his captain's life would prove successful. He was so confident
                     the man who was in his way would not live twenty-four hours from the time when
                     he parted with him that he did not deem it necessary to wait and assure himself
                     of his death.
                  Confident and exultant, therefore, he hurried back to his native town to impart
                     the tidings, so that Emma might learn of her bereavement and school her heart
                     as soon as possible into resignation under the terrible, harrowing
                     infliction.
                  But the telegraph is swifter than even the winged engine of the railroads.
                  When Lindsay arrived at his home in the North he was astounded to learn that
                     the day before Maud and Emma had started for the valley of the Shenandoah to
                     nurse their wounded soldier. He had therefore unconsciously met and passed them
                     while on his way north. Inquiring diligently he soon learned that only two days
                     previously old Mr. Dimond had received a telegraphic message from the surgeon
                     of the regiment to which his son belonged.
                  The message read, briefly:—
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 NEAR CEDAR CREEK, VA., October 20, 1864.
                                 
                                    ROSWELL O. DIMOND, Esq, S—, N. Y.
                                 
                              
                              Son Capt. Chester Dimond dangerously wounded. Lies at farmhouse
                                 near late field fought at Cedar Creek. Needs best of female care.
                                 Road up valley and country surrounding where he lies, perfectly
                                 safe. For further information inquire at Winchester, or, near the
                                 battle-field for the writer.
                              
                                 T. S—, M. D., Surgeon 1— Reg't, N. Y. V.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  When old Mr. Dimond received this despatch, which Lindsay so diligently
                     inquired out subsequently, it agitated him considerably. Too aged, and unequal
                     to make the hurried journey himself to a region of country where every thing
                     was in a state of hurry, bustle, and apparent confusion and contention, he
                     hardly knew what to do. He felt he could not go himself.
                  Nor could he appeal to Dewitt, because Dewitt was already in command in the
                     enemy's country; in fact Dewitt had borne a gallant part in the late battle,
                     and was now with his brother unknown to father, sister, and betrothed; it was
                     he who had prompted the surgeon to write and send the despatch, he desiring to
                     attend to Chester who now required his entire time, and the surgeon's duties
                     taking him across those channels where he could readily put himself in
                     communication with the telegraph. Nor could the old gentleman call on Will.
                     Will was in the far West. There was only John left. He decided therefore, he
                     must ask John to leave the discharge of the onerous duties in the place where
                     he resided, however much it might be regretted, and come and accompany Maud to
                     Virginia.
                  He immediately, therefore, penned a despatch to his oldest son and entrusted it
                     to a trusty messenger to carry and send from the nearest telegraph station. The
                     despatch went on its errand of love. The next morning John came, and before
                     noon he and his sister, and Emma, who had also hastily prepared herself,
                     intensely anxious to minister, a good angel, to the needs of her wounded lover,
                     were being bowled swiftly along among the ragged hills lying between
                     Canandaigua and Elmira.
                  
                  In due season, the man, with two sad-eyed, fearful-hearted women in his escort,
                     arrived at the stricken Chester's bedside.
                  They found Dewitt watching; but so soon as they had exchanged greetings he
                     girded on his sword and was away to join Emory and his Corps. His care could
                     now be dispensed with at the sick man's bedside, and military duties are
                     imperative.
                  When John and the two anxious women came, Chester was burning with fever and
                     delirious. The physician despaired of his life, but thought it possible—and
                     barely possible, that with the kindest, most unremitting care he might recover.
                     The care was given by Emma, Maud and John. For two long, fearful weeks, while
                     the suffering invalid lay on the brink of the grave, his prisoned soul at times
                     just ready to escape and fleet over the river, they watched, two at a time,
                     faithfully and tirelessly by his bedside. Not a movement, a look, nor a breath
                     of his escaped them; they made no mistakes.
                  Their tireless, faithful attention—the attention of love, was
                     rewarded. At the expiration of those two long weeks he began to convalesce,
                     slowly; and it was two weeks more before he could be removed, by slow and easy
                     stages, to Winchester. And when at Winchester, the motion of the short journey
                     had so prostrated him that he came near falling into a relapse, and it was
                     another month before himself or any of his friends dared to continue the
                     journey.
                  It was nearly two months from the day he received the ugly ball in his thigh
                     before he could journey back into, and breathe again the invigorating air that
                     played its music around the time-stained gables of the old ancestral home; and
                     months longer, and the war ended before he was completely well again—before he
                     was the strong, vigorous, animated, handsome Chester who had won the heart of
                     Emma Peters while she was yet a child.
                  He did win her heart, entirely, while she was still a child.
                  The novelists may talk all the nonsense they please about a woman's not being
                     competent to have all her soul drawn from her before she has arrived at
                     maturity. Their talk in this direction doesn't amount to anything. It
                        is all nonsense. The child Emma had commenced at sixteen, to
                     love Chester as faithfully and as intensely as she could ever love. Trusting in
                     his generosity and his worth, she had given him her whole, fresh, pure soul.
                     Had he betrayed the trust it would surely have killed her.
                  Happily, her lover was a man who had a soul as strong, as true and steadfast,
                     as great—as incapable of deceit or treachery, as was hers. There was no 
                        possibillty
                        possibility
                      that he could treat her with baseness.
                  They were worthy of and belonged to each other; and hence, being plighted, when
                     in the natural course of events Chester had recovered his usual health, they
                     two became one, really so, and commenced to fulfill the commencement of their
                     highest happiness.
                  They now occupy the old, ancestral Dimond mansion; caring for old Mr. and Mrs.
                     Dimond, an aged, cheerful couple, the one about sixty-five, and the other more
                     than seventy-five years old. Dewitt, as I have stated in my story relating the
                     great event in his life, occupies with his lovely wife and family of fine young
                     children, the half of the original five hundred acres purchased by his
                     grandfather of Mr. Phelps of Canandaigua.
                  Maud, as I have also stated in my notice of her sister, the peerless Lucy, is
                     yet at home, and is now treading on the skirts of old-maidism. She is a
                     splendid woman. Like her sisters Julia and Ida she is tall and queenly; pure,
                     pearly complexion; features, regular, sweet, and strong; hair, long, glittering
                     golden, flashing bewilderment into the male heart; form, perfect as Juno's;
                     intellect, serene and powerful.
                  She is past twenty-five, just at the commencement of perfect maturity, with a
                     heart sweet, and as yet untouched. She wants a lover; he must be talented,
                     brave and handsome. He must be generous and warm-hearted. She has decided. None
                     other need apply. For, she can no more be cheated than could her sister Belle;
                     neither is she, as was Ida, afraid to live an old maid.
                  Lindsay went from S— soon after arriving there from the bloody field of Cedar
                     Creek. He has never since returned to molest anybody. He knows his meditated
                     crime is known, and he dare not return to face the scorn and loathing that
                     would surely meet him in such event. His parents died within a year after the
                     war closed. Whether his guilty
                     conduct had a cause in their death no one knows. No one ever spoke to them in
                     regard to the matter, nor did they ever mention it to anybody. If they guessed
                     their son's iniquity from his altered conduct and the different treatment he
                     received from the neighbors, after his return, they kept it to themselves. They
                     were all a secret people. Lindsay's estate in S— is now offered for sale
                     through the medium of an agent.
                  Thus the matter stands:—There are in the fair, enviable Lake Region of Western
                     New York, a virgin female heart of the noble order, and one of its fairest
                     estates that await an occupant. Who comes! Be sure your form is manly, your
                     heart is strong, and your mind is broad, capacious, and stable, before you set
                     out; because none other will be taken to their hearts by the royal girl and the
                     royal neighbors by whom she is surrounded. That is certain.
                  And now a word with regard to old Molly, my heroine.
                  The Dimond party took her with them from the battlefield of Cedar Creek to
                     Winchester. There, completely worn out, she died of old age and was decently
                     interred by them before they returned to the North. Chester designs erecting a
                     suitable monument at her head next summer, God willing.
                  And to close:—If my story has failed to indicate her monetary value in the
                     slave market, there is a charming little white girl who plays in the parlors
                     and romps on the spreading, shady lawns surrounding the Dimond farm-mansion,
                     whose name testifies to Chester and Emma Dimond's appreciation of the old
                     negress' moral worth.
                  The little girl, Chester and Emma's oldest, whose hair is shining brown, and
                     whose eyes are like those stars which burn liquid golden, answers to the name
                     of Mary; simply Mary Dimond. There are many Marys in the family
                     and among their numerous friends, but no initial of theirs graces her name in
                     the middle. If old Molly were alive she would know why.
                  NOTE.—The author does not desire to be understood as giving sanction in this
                     sketch to the associating together of people of different colors. He thinks it
                     is no part of any Providential or Natural Plan that they shall meet in habitual
                     intercourse; but as long as human devices make such association inevitable, as
                     in a country like this, he sees no particular harm in accepting the fact,
                     trying to make the best of it, and hence occasionally making a note of a good
                     deed done by a person of one of the inferior colors.

               CHARLEY BENNETT'S ESCAPE.
               CHARLEY BENNETT got tired of farming when he was about one and twenty. For the
                  last two or three years it had been exceeding irksome business to him, plodding
                  along day after day, wearily I suppose over the same old acres, following the plow
                  among the twenty year old pine stumps on his father's farm, and getting jerked
                  "straight' every now and then when the unyielding point caught on some
                  "everlasting" root, and everything, plow, team, and man, were "brought up
                     all standing:"—he got tired of the plowing, the "dragging," of
                  hoeing corn, and of swinging the scythe among those same thickly sown, everlasting
                  stumps year after year.
               The same steady, hard, work, work, work, year in and year out, at last fretted,
                  and worried, and tired him terribly. The fine, strong, comely boy got discontented
                  and therefore grew wearied. It seemed to him at last that he could endure his
                  situation and his magnified trials no longer. He became desperate at last, when
                  not much past twenty—so desperate that he resolved to speak to his father and
                  inform him that he couldn't stand his present mode of life any longer—that he felt
                  he must certainly run away unless he should have help.
               It happened that while hanging onto the plow handles one day, and while one of his
                  disconsolate, gloomy moods was weighing down pretty heavily on him, he glanced his
                  eyes away from his team and plow in vague, despondent search of consolation—he
                  glanced his eyes away and beheld his father advancing leisurely across the field
                  toward him. The sight pleased him greatly. He regarded his parent's advent as
                  wonderfully opportune with his thoughts.
               
               "Now," thought Charley, quite cheerfully, as soon as he saw him, "now is my time.
                  I'll speak to father at once and let him know that this kind of business won't do
                  for me any more."
               He halted his horses, turned his back to them, and rested, leaning back between
                  the plow handles until his father came up. Mr. Bennett, an easy-tempered, kindly,
                  tolerably sensible man, as the world goes, was soon alongside.
               Said Charley, entirely occupied with his grief, and plunging into his subject
                  abruptly:—
               "Father, I can't stand this working on the farm any longer. I feel worse than any
                  nigger ever felt down South. I've got to go away and get some rest."
               Mr. Bennett was surprised; he had not imagined that discontent had been breeding
                  in Charley's mind; but he kept his surprise to himself; he wasn't going to give
                  the youth any advantage. He inquired kindly:—
               "How do you think you can better your condition by going away, Charley?"
               "O!" replied Charley glibly, and pitching into the core of the matter at once,
                  "there are lots of young men and boys on the railroad who have easy times, see the
                  world, and some of them make a thousand dollars a year. I wish I could go
                  there."
               "Make a thousand a year do they! Well! how much of it do they lay by for a rainy
                  day?"
               "O, I don't know! considerable I guess."
               "Considerable! fiddlesticks!" said Mr. Bennet, contemptuously, "they save about
                  three cents a week less than nothing."
               "O pshaw, father! It can't be they are so foolish as to spend everything."
               "Women, wine, and cards!" quoted the father, significantly.
               "But you don't think I'd forget my little Saloma for whom I want to get a home so
                  much?"
               He spoke reservedly; he was young; his love was yet young and holy in his heart,
                  and therefore, though a boy, he felt the young man's respect for it; but still, he
                  spoke, disclaiming his father's imputation.
               Mr. Bennett replied:—
               "It seems so. Haven't I offered to put you up a house on the Barker lot that I
                  have given you so that you can marry and have a home after you have worked for me
                  three years longer, as soon as you'll be old and wise enough to take care of
                  yourself and a wife?"
               "Yes, but father, I'm drilled out among these condemnation old pine
                  stumps that never mean to rot; and besides, I can earn enough on the railroad in
                  three years to build two decent houses. Father!" said the youth earnestly, "help
                  me or I shall run away."
               "Women, wine, and cards, Charley. You're just the right age to commence."
               "O, hang that old saw! I shan't forget darling little Saloma."
               "Yes you will, with regard to saving your money and getting a home for her. You
                  have not the stability about you that your cousins Dewitt and Chester Dimond have,
                  though I say it of my own son."
               "Well, you and Julius try me. I want to rest a spell, and I guess I can take care
                  of myself as well as they can of themselves. Use your influence to get me a good
                  place on the railroad and see what I'll do. You've got boys enough to carry on the
                  farm without me, big as it is. Sam and Roy are both older, and Fred is as stout as
                  I am."
               "Well! I'll humor you," said the father sarcastically; "it will be better than to
                  have you run away. If you must go you shall have a fair chance; but mind; when the
                  three years are expired you'll build your own house."
               "Yes!" exclaimed Charley, joyfully, "I'll build it; and now I'll run across the
                  creek to Rapalje's and tell Salome."
               "You start that plow," said Mr. Bennett decisively: "It'll be plenty time enough
                  to run over to Rapalje's in the evening; or even next Sunday will be better."
               Charley looked crestfallen, and some like rebelling, but he started the plow. He
                  thought it best not to endanger his good fortune.
               The father went along to the house and communicated to his wife the fact that
                  Charley had become exceeding discontented with farming and that he had decided to
                  get him a place on the railroad where he desired to go.
               Mrs. Bennett, a quiet, sensible woman, who well understood her son's predilections
                  and propensities, feared greatly for the boy if he should go there, but after
                  hearing the whole story and talking with him herself, acquiesced that it might be
                  better if he should go away for a time.
               
               The next day therefore, Mr. Bennett set out for the city of S—, several miles
                  distant, but the nearest point on the railroad in which his interest lay, to
                  consult with his oldest son Julius, who resided, and who was building up a pretty
                  big fortune there.
               Julius did not favor the idea that one of his brothers should go on the railroad
                  any more than did his parents, but as he soon perceived it was a settled affair,
                  he heartily joined his power to his father's to secure for Charley the desired
                  place. Mr. Bennett owning considerable stock in the road concerned, and Julius
                  being pretty well acquainted with several prominent railroad men among those who
                  resided in, and those who frequently visited the city, they easily set things in
                  train to accomplish the boy's desire. The influence of the railroad officials
                  being enlisted in Charley's behalf they soon secured a place for him; and the
                  place was a very good place, too—a very valuable place for a neophyte in the
                  business. They procured him the place of third clerk in the United States Mail
                  Car; salary just fifteen dollars per week, with an excellent prospect of rapid
                  promotion if faithful to duty.
               Having secured the place Mr. Bennett returned home and communicated the good news
                  to his son. Charley was overjoyed. He started at once and walked rapidly over the
                  creek to communicate with his sweetheart, Salome Rapalje. He thought a great deal
                  of her, and she must hear of his good fortune immediately.
               Salome was a brown-skinned, piquant fairy. She was not handsome. It is a good
                  thing to be handsome; we all love beauty of form and feature, but like it as well
                  as we may we all know that there is something that is better than mere physical
                  beauty. Salome was one of the happy ones who possess this something. She was
                  intelligent, vivacious and sparkling; her heart was warm and kind, and she was
                  agreeable. None met her casually but desired to see her again. Old acquaintances
                  never met her but to part with her with regret. Her sparkling countenance, and her
                  racy, picturesque, solid, heartsome conversation always pleased and
                  interested. She was a very nice, good, deep-thinking young woman—not
                  girl, but woman.
               It was well understood that Charley and this fine young woman belonged to one
                  another; she exercised a great influence with him, and he loved her very much. She
                  was, as you have already gathered, really the better thinker—the stronger minded
                  of the two; but as sometimes, but infrequently happens with such women, she had
                  allowed her heart to go out and meet an inferior before the strong man had come
                  along to conquer it in its own fortress; and now whatever might betide, she would
                  keep fast to the love she had chosen.
               There are thousands and thousands nearly as good, but such really choice women as
                  Salome are very rarely met with; if they were oftener encountered millions of men
                  would want wives all their lives without getting them, unless they should. seek
                  them in the regular Ethiopic style. There may be one such in a thousand in
                  civilized countries, where only they are found.
               Such a woman seldom loves unless first conquered. It is almost impossible for her
                  to submit herself to any man unless he shall first conquer her
                  affections with his love presided over by mental strength superior to hers. Hence
                  I have always wondered how Charley Bennett ever got the love of the superfine,
                  superior Salome Rapalje. That there is some singular circumstance connected with
                  its incipiency in her heart I have not the least doubt. I had not the least doubt
                  when the fine woman related to me the particulars for this sketch; but as the
                  subject was of an exceeding delicate nature, delicacy itself forbade my asking for
                  explanation unless she should first volunteer an opening. I have then, with regard
                  to their early heart history but the bare fact that she did learn to love him, and
                  with her whole heart; how it ever came about is a secret
                  yet resting between him and her.
               Charley didn't know all this of course; he didn't know what a treasure he had won.
                  He only knew that she was a most charming little woman—that he cared a great deal
                  more about her than he did about any other, and that he always should. He had
                  learned that much of her power.
               Without knowing why, he only knew that there was a magnetic power in Salome
                  Rapalje that would keep him from all other women, whatever the circumstances,
                  whether she were present or absent. Rightly therefore, he had substantially
                  answered his father that there need be no fear that the women he should meet in
                  the world would wean his heart from
                  her. They would not. They could not. Whomsoever's heart it might have been that
                  she entered, there Salome Rapalje entered to stay. And she knew it too. The gist
                  of the matter is: Women like her cannot be cheated into accepting a place in a
                  heart that they cannot keep, or in the heart of a fickle-minded man. Women like
                  her know their value and power, and it is much by reason of their knowledge that
                  they keep them.
               So, Salome having ransacked every nook and cranny in Charley's heart, knew she was
                  in it to stay, and when he reported to her what his father had said concerning
                  "women, wine, and cards," she had no more fear for his heart in regard to those
                  powerful soul-subduers than he had for himself; she was not a bit afraid after he
                  had once placed his lips to hers that he would forsake her refinement, sweetness,
                  and strength of character for any foreign, tawdry, gilded vice, or for any
                  competing virtue, as to that matter.
               She held him, with regard to the affections—if the purely sensual be excepted—much
                  as if she were the man and he the woman. It was with them about as it would have
                  been between his brother Julius and most charming cousin Belle if they had got so
                  far with their love episode, and concerning which I have informed the interested
                  reader in a previous sketch.
               Salome did not fear for her lover with regard to other women; but, about the "wine
                  and cards!" She reflected and was fearful. To think about him in the connection
                  saddened her. Hadn't her brother Hermann conducted his reeling steps home on more
                  than one occasion, after they had played at checkers all the evening until twelve
                  o'clock, and emptied the three-quart pitcher of hard cider, while she looked sadly
                  on? Hadn't she keenly felt that at such times Charley had seemed to care more for
                  play and for cider than even for her or anything else?
               She thought about those times when he spoke of the "women, wine, and cards," and
                  it troubled her—it troubled her greatly.
               It troubled her so seriously that she carried the thought with her, uppermost in
                  her mind, all through their last interview, and when the time came for them to
                  part, he to proceed to enter upon his new vocation, she reached up and pulled him
                  down to her and whispered, just as if fearful some one might hear and her language
                  compromise him:—
               "Charley, I shall not ask you to keep away from the saloons and billiard tables,
                  but I wish you would for my sake."
               Said Charley:—
               "O Saloma! I don't think there is any need to be too particular; and I shall want
                  to be like other young men on the road, but as you particularly desire it I will
                  try and not visit such places very often."
               "Please do;" said the young lady patiently.
               With that Charley kissed her fondly good-bye and went away into the world, into
                  one of its most dangerous places, on one of its great railroads.
               I am not going to let you into the secret of what great road Charley patronized.
                  The seclusion that all of my characters have stipulated for before narrating to me
                  the great events of their lives forbids my betraying it. Let it suffice therefore,
                  that his place was on one of the great railroads of the great State of New York,
                  and that for the facilities it will afford me in the arranging and narrating of my
                  facts I choose to style the particular road in question the New York Central;
                  though the road may have been the New York and Erie, the Great
                  Northern Central, or some one other of the many important roads of the Empire
                  State.
               Also, the names of places that I may hereafter mention in this sketch I will not
                  vouch for as the names of places that belong in the story, but that I adopt those
                  which arise readily in my mind and which I can conveniently use.
               The reader being now properly warned I can proceed with this interesting fragment
                  of history.
               As soon as Charley had received his appointment he hurried to S—, and went into
                  the United States Mail Car and went to work. He was immensely pleased with the new
                  business at first; but he had not been employed many days in the car before he
                  discovered, as the folks say where I was born, "that he had jumped out of the
                  frying pan into the fire." The constant, ceaseless occupation, and continual, and
                  in time horrible jar and motion of the car fatigued him terribly; but
                  I will do him the justice to say that, almost unbearable as the motion of the rail
                  car becomes to some, among whom was he, and severe as the labor is on junior
                  clerks in the postal service, he stuck to his business as manfully and faithfully while on duty, as any of them. I am
                  sure he never broke a package of Ed. Allen's troublesome pictures over his knee,
                  as perhaps did the others, quite often. There was too much of the gentleman in him
                  to wantonly destroy property entrusted to his care; especially after himself had
                  sought and accepted the trust.
               Charley was faithful and did not shirk his labor, though during the first year,
                  and I might say too during the whole of the three years that he kept his place, he
                  was awfully tired, and more than once wished himself back on the farm and subject
                  to his father's orders; but he did not withdraw; fear of being laughed at I
                  suppose, kept him at his post.
               And too, during the first six months on the road he was tolerably faithful to
                  little Salome's parting wish, visiting saloons and billiard halls when he had
                  opportunity, but seldom.
               In fact, it is no more than justice to the morals of the youthful employes on the
                  New York Central Road, to say, that, despite the insinuations of such men as Mr.
                  Bennett, those young men may be regarded as temperate and respectable in their
                  conduct. Though constantly brought into familiar contact with gross immoralities,
                  they yet, as a class, hold themselves above temptation, and may be regarded,
                  comparatively, as a body of moral young men. They are not, certainly, and cannot
                  be, so simply virtuous as the youth of almost any rural community, but, as a body,
                  their morals will compare quite favorably with the morals of other young men in
                  their station in life in the cities. The same may also be said with regard to
                  their brethren on most of the other great roads of the Continent.
               Why these young men should so universally sustain themselves superior to the
                  circumstances which surround, and naturally ought greatly to affect them, no one,
                  I believe, has ever attempted to explain. Perhaps the solution may exist, or
                  partly exist, in the fact, if it be a fact, that the Superintendents, etc., of the
                  roads who engage their services, are a body of men so intelligent, competent, and
                  skillful to read human nature, that they readily discern and choose those who are
                  superior in moral strength. Will some one of the many eminent psychologists of the
                  country try please explore the subject and impart to an expectant world the result
                  of their researches, and whether my surmise be correct?—or shall I undertake the
                  matter myself?
               But if Charley was surrounded by so fine, strong-minded a body of young men, their
                  influence and example did not long prevent his being waylaid and seduced by his
                  moral weaknesses. When moving among the best moral minds, if a young man be fond
                  of indulgences, he is not long in finding, or congenial company is not long in
                  discovering him. So, of course, Charley being eminently open to dissipation, did
                  not affiliate closely a great while with those who gave tone to the
                  society of his class. They all liked him, liked his free, generous ways and joyous
                  disposition whenever in their company, and never lost sight of him, nor he of
                  them; but his intimate companions were soon almost exclusively among those who may
                  be regarded as the pleasure seekers—those who make dissipation the object of their
                  youth, and oftentimes of their lives.
               He had not been on the road more than six months before invitations to drink and
                  to handle the "cue" were quite frequent and nearly as often
                  accepted.
               Now, I am not condemning billiards. I have in another sketch spoken quite
                  encouragingly, I think, for that fascinating, and also instructive game.
                  Billiards, like base ball, and tag, and pull away at
                  school, has its uses. It is, like those, a nice, healthful game to play; more, it
                  is better than they; it is an ingenious, deep game; and if properly played at
                  proper seasons, educates and strengthens the mind. It is excelled by chess, the
                  greatest of all games, only in its infinite intricacy and variety of strategy; in
                  all else billiards is immensely superior.
               Billiards is an active, healthful, beautiful, instructive game. I believe in
                  billiards; just as I do in almost any nice thing, when you keep the thing
                  subjected with proper restrictions—say when you can support your own table and
                  choose your own company, or when a club of young men can keep their own room, play
                  at seasonable times only, stop playing in season, and not be compelled to use
                  their hard earnings to pay for the play and their bets; but when you come to "run
                  the thing into the ground," as Charley did, then "I'm down on it."
               
               Billiards is a nice game, but for the Lord's sake as well as your own don't make
                  it a passion as Charley did before he had been a year in the United
                  States Mail Car.
               Yes, before the first year was expired Charley played at billiards nearly half the
                  evenings of his life. He ran on the road four consecutive days, and was then off a
                  corresponding number, nearly every evening of which was spent in the billiard
                  rooms of Albany. It is however, fair to say that he still remembered Salome's
                  pleading wish, and that memory of her did, in the commencement of his playing,
                  usually tear him from the seductive game before the night was far gone; but
                  afterwards—well, I'll mention it again by and by.
               Nor did he drink a great deal; but then, more than enough.
               It was seldom that he made a bet; but then, again, he lost and had to pay for a
                  great many more games than he won, and besides, constant indulgence was surely
                  sapping what little strength of character he had—it was unfitting him for other
                  useful employment if he should ever leave, or lose, his place in the postal
                  service. Instead of practicing self-denial and withdrawing from the game after he
                  had played a proper length of time, and thereby strengthening his powers of
                  self-control, he soon gave loose reins to indulgence and was hence destroying
                  stability of character—such as he had.
               Well, what do you suppose was the result of his first year's service on the road?
                  I will let two or three questions asked by his father, and his answers to them
                  when he made his twelfth monthly visit home, speak for him.
               At this time what little liquor he had drunk had scarce made itself perceptible in
                  his countenance. He was but a shade paler than his confinement in the mail car
                  should have made him. Even the faithful, lynx-eye of the loving Salome failed to
                  detect him in this regard.
               Returning home for his twelfth visit, he had scarce crossed the threshold of his
                  father's house when the old man, who had, for reasons of his own, waited patiently
                  for the year to expire before he should make inquiries into a subject that could
                  but have been matter of deep anxiety to himself and wife, spoke. He addressed
                  Charley pleasantly, though with a certain inquisitorial air that implied misdoubt
                  as to the answer he might get. He wasn't the most discreet of men.
               "Hey! Charley! Home again are you? Well, a year has expired since you entered the
                  service of the Government; and now tell us what you have done,"
               Charley looked a little "sheepish;" but he answered bravely:—
               "Got the second place in the car and twenty dollars a week when I go again."
               "Yes! yes! fiddlestick for the twenty dollars a week! How much have you laid up on
                  fifteen? That's the substance of the matter!"
               "Two hundred dollars."
               "Two hundred dollars! Jupiter! And I have clothed you! Five hundred and eighty
                  dollars for what you have eat, and to go to the theatre once a week, as often as
                  any prudent young man ought to indulge. Hungry business! that Postal Service!
                  Ain't it Charley? Eh!" inquired the old man whimsically.
               "O don't Father! he'll do better next time, I hope," kindly spoke the mother.
               "No, not very," still bravely spoke the youth.
               "What is it, then? Is it 'women, wine and cards?'"
               "No, not exactly; but I guess I have played billiards pretty often
                  lately."
               "Billi-ar-ds! So! so! Well, you are now twenty-one and can clothe and
                  take care of yourself. Do you understand?"
               "Yes, I am a man, and expect to take care of myself after this," said Charley a
                  little proudly.
               "Tut! tut! You are always welcome to the old home. You know what I mean!"
               "Yes," replied the son filially, "I will come just the same."
               He beckoned to his sister Hattie, the youngest of the family, to come to him. She
                  came and he inquired in low tones:—
               "How is Saloma doing, Hattie?"
               "O! she's all right. She talked to me about you all the afternoon yesterday."
               In about ten minutes Charley was over to Rapalje's, when Salome confirmed his
                  sister's intimations while he held her in his arms into which he had caught her up
                  as he always did as she came running to meet him at his first appearance after any
                  absence; but as this is not designed to be particularly a love story I will not record all the
                  lovers' sweet talk they enjoyed on this occasion.
               I will only assure you that there was plenty of it, inasmuch as they were very
                  fond of one another; and besides, as I must unavoidably recount some very good
                  conversation of the kind near the close of the story, I will not now offer spices
                  that might cut and impair the keenness of a subsequent relish.
               Of course while the two were very happy in his visit the precious little woman
                  still could not help but feel anxious when he informed her he had saved but two
                  hundred dollars of his year's earnings. She necessarily inferred he could have set
                  but little store by her last words to him just previous to his going on the road.
                  But spite of that she knew he did care a great deal about her, and consequently
                  she allowed herself to be happy during the visit and strove successfully with
                  herself to hide everything that might alloy his pleasure, though she could but
                  secretly and constantly wish he would be a man, make a law to his morals, and
                  stick to it, as she was sure he could, if he only would.
               Did Charley do the thing that would have been such a blessed joy to little Salome?
                  Not by any means, for yet awhile.
               Hear about him! He went back to the mail car again and staid another year, when,
                  returning again for the twelfth time his father again inquired:—
               "What luck with self-control this time, Charley?"
               Charley answered faintly; he knew he was blameful, and he was really too
                  true-hearted to defy his father, if the question did bear hardly on him, not being
                  so considerately worded as it might have been—he answered faintly:—
               "I have saved only a hundred dollars this year; but have now the first place and
                  shall get two thousand the ensuing year."
               The old man shook his head sadly, not speaking. He had caught sight of the little
                  swelled red streaks in the corners of his son's eyes, and deemed it better to
                  remain silent.
               Reader! do you understand the horrible meaning there is in those little crooked,
                  bloody-spangled lines when they appear flushed and swelled in eyes that have been
                  hitherto clean and pure?
               The divine little woman, Salome Rapalje, knew what it meant when he went to see
                  her, for the tears dimmed her bright, sparkling eyes when she discovered them
                  there; still, she strove to hide those tears, and she lay as willingly in
                  Charley's arms as of old.
               You can learn why, pretty soon, when Charley gets done railroading.
               Again, when his time was expired, Charley returned to his duties on the railroad.
                  He drank pretty freely now, and often played billiards nearly all night on every
                  one of the alternate four nights that were his. He began to carry around with him
                  a haggard, old look about the eyes, and his white, pure face was assuming a
                  reddish cast.
               Eleven months of the third year are gone, for the three last of which he has not
                  been at home. He knows how his face and eyes appear and he is ashamed to show them
                  there. Bad also; he has not laid by a cent of the two thousand dollars; indeed, he
                  has drawn on the three hundred formerly saved, to the extent of another
                  hundred.
               His case briefly summed up discloses that he is now worth just two hundred
                  dollars; heavy, haggard eyes; a discolored face; and a mind seduced with
                  billiards, though he has as yet been strictly faithful to his postal duties, and
                  still retains the esteem and confidence of his superiors in the department.
               Once more:—Eleven months and a week of the third year are expired. Then, one day
                  the stage was driven past his father's house as it had been driven past daily for
                  many years gone, only on this day, Charley, as he had been a few times before, was
                  a passenger inside. Hattie, standing in the doorway of the house just as the stage
                  was arriving opposite, saw him through the open coach window sitting alone
                  inside.
               She called out joyfully:—
               "Charley! Charley! You've come at last have you? Get out of there and come in here
                  quick, sir! and tell us what you've been about for the last three long
                  months."
               Charley did not turn his face. He looked straight ahead. The coach did not stop.
                  It kept straight on, whirling past as quickly as though there were no brothers and
                  sisters in the world who might desire to meet. Hattie called excitedly down the
                  hall to her mother in the kitchen:—
               
               "Mother! mother! The stage is going by and Charley is in it; and he doesn't stop
                  it and get out. What ails the man?"
               "I guess you're mistaken. I guess it can't be he or the stage would stop. You know
                  he wrote to us that we needn't look for him now until the year had expired;"
                  called back Mrs. Bennett.
               "Yes, I remember; but it's certainly he. How queer!" persisted the young girl.
               "Watch and see if the stage stops over at Rapalje's."
               Hattie watched.
               Yes; the stage stopped at Rapalje's. She saw Charley get out and stride at once
                  through the open gateway, across the green, grassy door-yard, and in at the open
                  door of the hospitable old farm house.
               Salome also was watching while the stage came along. She knew that Charley ought
                  to come, that he had plenty of time during any of the four days that were his, and
                  hoped he loved her well enough to change his mind and come and see her before the
                  year was all gone. Therefore she had watched every day lately when stage time
                  came, and had now discovered him inside and was standing back in the hall waiting
                  expectantly.
               She had seen him, and got as near as she could to where he might catch her slight
                  form up into his strong arms and not be under the observation of the wandering
                  eyes of the coach driver. For a fortune she would not have flown out into the yard
                  and missed giving him this lover's sweet privilege, always observed between them
                  at their meetings.
               Charley alighted from the stage and strode across the green lawn and into the
                  hall; his aspect was stern, gloomy, and also downcast. Salome saw, but she did not
                  hesitate. She flew up to him as soon as he was inside, expecting to be caught up
                  as usual. He did not put his arms about her and raise her up. Only:—He said
                  abruptly, forcedly, and bitterly:—
               "Salome!" It was the first time she ever remembered to have heard him pronounce
                  her name in two syllables. He said:—
               "Salome! I give you back your troth-plight. I am not fit to keep it."
               Salome looked at him keenly, steadily, and with serene countenance, though both
                  his refusal to lift her up and his words had hurt her fearfully; though she didn't
                  let him know just then how hard he had struck her. She looked at him keenly. She
                  saw there was something amiss—something more than "wine and cards."
               She looked keenly. Did he love her yet? Yes! His language was the result of shame
                  and generosity. She had never doubted him, and she didn't now. But he forced her
                  to question; and she inquired in that tone which imperiously demands
                  attention:—
               "Have you ceased to love me?"
               "God knows I have not. I love you the best of anything on earth."
               "Well, then, keep me! I shall not take back my pledges. Don't speak
                  of it. It hurts me;" her small form shrunk and writhed as if lacerated with pain;
                  the heart was.
               "But, O Salome! Wait until you know how low I have sunk and until you hear of what
                  I am accused. Maybe you'll despise me; and I wouldn't keep you then, however much
                  I might need and want you."
               "I know how low you are sunk. I love you Charley! Must I tell it
                  again? When a Rapalje loves, it is for forever. When a Rapalje promises, it is for
                  forever. There was never one of them known to break his word, or to waver in his
                  love. They are truer than the true Douglasses. The women of the family are the
                  same. You may be accused of murder and I shall be faithful to you. You may
                     be a murderer"—a curious smile, a smile that Charley couldn't
                  begin to fathom, wreathed her brown, piquant features—"and I shall still adhere
                  faithfully to your love and your fortunes. Charley! I love you! Do
                  you comprehend me now?"
               Once more she walked close up and put herself in his embrace.
               He didn't deny her now. He caught her closer than ever before. He pressed her so
                  tight to his breast that she didn't know but he might murder her
                  before he had satisfied himself.
               He said:—
               "Dear, dear little Saloma! You are my angel. I believe you have saved
                  my soul from damnation."
               "Yes;" acquiesced she very quietly, contrasted with his fervent demonstrations, "I
                  think so. You'll stay with me now and now I want to hear what your trouble
                  is."
               
               "They accuse me of being a thief."
               "A thief!" She looked up into his eyes; hers laughing.
               "But you don't believe it. I hoped you wouldn't; but I didn't know but you might."
                  He drew a great sigh of relief.
               "Believe it! O no, Charley! I know you couldn't be guilty of a meanness. If I had
                  thought it you never could have got me. Rapaljes are not caught with meannesses;
                  that is a reason why we are so true," said she playfully, then continuing, "but
                  what was stolen?"
               "A letter, or package, containing five one thousand dollar bills, addressed to the
                  merchants, Meriden & Co., No. — Pearl street, New York, N. Y."
               "How are you implicated?"
               "The money letter was received in the mail sack taken from the hooks at St. Johns
                  or some other station not far west from Albany. All matter received by us in this
                  manner is overhauled by us on the car, assorted, and put in train for the various
                  destinations. The mail for New York which thus accumulates between Buffalo and
                  Albany we toss in sacks by itself, which sacks are immediately locked on our
                  arrival in Albany, or before if they become filled, and the keys properly cared
                  for, the locked sacks only being turned over to the agents on the Hudson River
                  Road. Well, we thus received and supposed we thus disposed of the money letter
                  from St. Johns. The letter however did not arrive in New York in company with its
                  fellows. The postmaster at St. Johns swears to putting the letter in his sack,
                  which I received; my book also receipts it as having been put into the New York
                  sack, and the clerk who received that sack in the Post Office in New York swears
                  that the letter did not arrive in the sack, so you see it is plain that the
                  package in question must have stopped in, or have been filched from my car."
               Salome was very deeply interested and had given all her faculties to this recital.
                  Resolving now to sift the matter thoroughly, she inquired:—
               "Haven't you informed me at some time that your car ran directly through to New
                  York?"
               "Yes, but on the day when the money was lost the axle of our car gave out and we
                  were compelled at Albany to transfer the mail to another car."
               "Had you completed assorting the St. Johns mail when you arrived in Albany?"
               Every woman wouldn't have thought of this question.
               Charley replied:—
               "No; that and considerable besides was on our hands when we arrived at the end of
                  our route. We had a heavy mail all along on that day, and being temporarily
                  shorthanded were often compelled to select out for only the way offices next us. I
                  completed the assorting while the great bulk of the mail was being transferred to
                  another car."
               "Were any of the irresponsible employes of the road allowed to enter your car to
                  assist in the transfer?"
               "No, not a man. We never allow that. Two of my juniors passed out other mail
                  matter while I was busy assorting the unfinished accumulations."
               "They gave it into trusty hands?"
               "Certainly. No doubt of it. And even if they hadn't the sack that should have
                  contained the letter, was locked, and arrived safely in New York as I have
                  said."
               But this sack must have been one of the last to leave the car?"
               "Yes, my juniors received it from me and passed it out while I was closing and
                  locking a Boston sack, which was the last."
               "Were the two juniors in the car with you perfectly trustworthy?"
               "Perfectly! They may sometimes handle troublesome packages a little more roughly
                  than they ought, but I will stake my life on their honesty as regards
                     stealing."
               "No window open on the same plane with, and near by the table at which you
                  worked?"
               "No. I have spoken of the affair as though it occured during the day, but it
                  really transpired on the Night Mail when every door and window was closed, except
                  of course during the transfer when a door was necessarily open."
               "You are sure you locked the New York mail sack in question before it was
                  delivered to the Hudson River Road agent, and also cared for the key
                  properly?"
               "Sure as fate! I never committed an oversight in that particular. What next my
                  little catechist of a lawyer?"
               "Charley!" said Salome, laughing, "that money is still in the mail car."
               
               "Impossible!" replied her lover, "I searched every angle and every spot of its
                  inside surface before leaving the road."
               "Yes, I was sure you had done so, or I should have asked. But," persisted she,
                  "the money is in the car. Where is the car now?"
               "At the Company's shops for repairs at West Albany."
               "You must take me down there. We will leave in the stage to-morrow morning."
               "Willingly."
               Accordingly, in the morning Salome and Charley started for Albany. Arrived there,
                  they proceeded directly to the Central Company's Shops. Introducing himself and
                  making known his business, Charley requested to be shown the particular car Salome
                  desired to see, at the same time desiring the foreman of the Works to accompany
                  them. The foreman, who as it happened that day held his place only pro
                     tem., the actual foreman having been called away, found it impossible
                  for some reason to accompany them, but he detailed one of the most intelligent men
                  in the shops to do the honors for him.
               This man conducted them to the car directly, where it stood among a number of
                  other old cars in a silent remote place away from the shops. When they came up to
                  it Charley saw and remarked at once that it had not yet been disturbed by the
                  workmen. It was in the same condition as when he last saw it.
               He, and Salome, and the workman, entered it. Salome immediately commenced to cast
                  her bright keen eyes about searchingly. It seemed that nothing could escape her
                  close scrutiny; but her enquiring glances could not directly discover anything
                  promising to their quest.
               Discovering nothing satisfactory she presently said to Charley:—
               "Where did your New York mail sack hang?"
               He indicated the hooks on which he had been used to catch its month. They were
                  just below the bottom of the window opening, and elevated a little above the desk
                  on which he and his clerks had been accustomed to work. They were between the desk
                  and the window, convenient to 
                     recieve
                     receive
                   its contents of letters whenever the New York pigeon-hole should become
                  filled.
               The little woman's eyes had no sooner rested on the hooks than she exclaimed
                  eagerly and joyfully:—
               "Why, Charley! what geese all you men are! And I can't understand either, even if
                  you did not bind it with others, how you could crowd five thousand dollars, and
                  all in one package too, through that little orifice, and not know it!"
               As she spoke she pointed to a little long slit broken out of a panel under the
                  window and close by the hooks, and at the same time seized a hammer that some
                  workman while passing had cast carelessly in one the floor.
               When Charley's eye caught the orifice he at once disclaimed the charge of
                  stupidity, declaring that the panel was not broken while he was in the car—that
                  some one must have broken it since he had bidden the car good-bye, and though the
                  missing money was found behind the panel as Salome anticipated, and as I shall
                  presently relate, he still to this day persists in maintaining his first
                  assertion.
               Altogether, I must confess that the circumstance wears a singular and peculiar
                  aspect. Considering the description Salome has given to me of the orifice—it would
                  have permitted scarce more than the entrance, flatwise, of the blade of an
                  ordinary carving knife—it seems impossible that even if Charley or one of his
                  clerks had missed the open mouth of the sack, he could have tossed so bulky an
                  affair as a letter containing five thousand dollars through so narrow a slit—it
                  seems impossible that he could have tossed it through there, supposing he had
                  decided to allow the letter to go into the pouch singly, and attempted it.
               I have a theory of my own with regard to the circumstance—a theory which is
                  strongly supported by the after conduct of the young scapegrace—action that is
                  developed in the close. My theory is not so plausible as it might be, still, when
                  I apply my knowledge of the young fellow's character and of his after conduct, it
                  appears to me to come within the bounds of reason. I will explain myself.
               I think that, in collusion with one of his juniors the young fellow has cunningly
                  outwitted his father, Salome, mail agents, railroad men, and all. I take the
                  standing that becoming thoroughly tired of his place in the Postal Service, and
                  also disgusted with his dissolute mode of life, he actually placed himself in a
                  questionable position in order to get a dismissal that he was not brave enough to
                  take of his own accord. He had not strength of character sufficient to enable him to back square out of a situation
                  that he had been so desirous to obtain in the first place, and to bid a bold
                  good-bye to a set of men who all, circumspect as well as dissolute, regarded him
                  with high favor and would regret exceedingly to lose him from among their
                  number.
               He had not strength of character for this, and therefore, as I think, employed one
                  of his juniors to dispose of the money package as intimated, well knowing, as he
                  did, that it must soon be discovered, for he had heard the car condemned for early
                  repairs before the breaking of the axle, and that therefore it would be run to the
                  shops to get an immediate overhauling during which operation the discovery must
                  necessarily transpire; and not fearing that among the three or four men who would
                  be put about the repairing, any one of them could discover the package so secretly
                  as to get the opportunity to hide it away from the others. Or if he should find
                  the opportunity the loss of the money would be so notorious by that time that he
                  would not dare to take advantage of it; and in case he should dare, Charley would
                  always be fortified with his junior clerk to "come down" on the
                  offending sinner and compel him to acknowledge his dereliction and make
                  restitution to suffering innocence.
               That is my theory. I think it reasonable, particularly and strongly so, when I
                  reflect on my knowledge of Charley's character and on a certain decisive stand he
                  took soon after getting married.
               When the precious fellow—precious to Salome, understand—reads this sketch, of
                  which he is the hero, will he please write me a line and inform me if I have hit
                  him? We all like to learn that we have been good at guess-work, Charley.
               I have left Salome standing some little time with a hammer in her hand—longer I
                  fear than gallantry will warrant; but I did want to ventilate my theory to the
                  understanding of an admiring world. That must be my excuse—and an excuse that I
                  think she will accept, for she is a jewel of a woman. I don't say it lightly; she
                  is a precious jewel; worthy to wear a coronet, if a republican does say it.
               Salome seized the workman's hammer, and quickly inserted the claws in the long,
                  narrow slit that had been broken in the panel just under the window, and behind
                  which a portion of the blind was usually allowed to drop down when the car was in
                  use.
               She did not ask one of the men to take the hammer; she was too seriously in
                  earnest for that. She commenced to pull and pry on the panel at once, herself.
               Being a strong and intelligent little woman and exerting her strength vigorously
                  and judiciously she soon tore the little board from the grooves in which its edges
                  were set, and there, lying exposed and crushed at the bottom when she wrenched it
                  away was the missing package. She seized it and held it up triumphantly before
                  Charley and the workman, and then—then—she burst into tears.
               She had been brave, and cheerful, and smiling until now; and, if the package had
                  not been discovered would have been the same until the end; but the happy
                  discovery showed that there had been a great strain on her faithful heart, the
                  sudden removal of which betrayed her into a joyful passion of weeping.
               The workman discreetly stepped from the car and walked across the yard to the
                  shops, leaving the lovers alone together.
               Salome stepped close to her lover and offered herself to him the same as was her
                  wont when they met after an absence. As always but that once when he met her with
                  suspicion hanging on him, he now again raised her light weight in his arms, she
                  saying as she dropped her head against his:—
               "Thank God! we can now prove your innocence."
               "Yes, thank God!" said Charley with a sigh of relief, "that I have so good an
                  angel to care for me."
               "Are you really in earnest now?" inquired she.
               Her joy did not prevent her wits from busying themselves. She had got a crafty
                  thought.
               Charley earnestly replied to her searching query:—
               "Solemnly so."
               "I thank God for that too!" said she seriously, "We'll have the red streaks from
                  those dear eyes that I like to look into, and the unwholesome tinge from that
                  comely face in less than three months."
               "How long have you suspected me?" asked the delinquent Charley, averting his face
                  in shamefacedness.
               
               "I expected it from the commencement, but I did not know
                  until you had been on the road more than a year."
               She wound her arms about him while she was speaking.
               "Why did you not speak and warn me?"
               "Because it would have done no good. Men like you will learn only by experience;
                  and experience too is often their ruin. And I did not speak to you because I have
                  always believed in a man's being a man and knowing his own business. Now however I
                  have changed my mind a little. I intend to have a hand in the matter after this!
                  I'll fix you, sir!"
               She spoke the last four words half archly, half seriously, and wholly earnestly,
                  withal. It was a happy blending. Charley forgot half his shamefacedness and felt
                  quite curious.
               He asked:—
               "Fix me! How?"
               "We are going to be married," said she, shily.
               "With all my heart!" and he kissed her till she blushed and blushed again, ending
                  by asking playfully and a little facetiously, too: "When is it to be my little
                  fairy knight?"
               "Oh Charley! Please don't misunderstand me. It is for your good I am trying to
                  act. It will be just as soon as we can get to 'Squire Cook's after the stage has
                  left us at father's."
               "Good! Bully for you! My little brown elf! You're a trump!"
               The boy had learned some slang on the railroad, and wasn't quite so particular to
                  whom he spoke it as he would have been once; nevertheless, he was quite serious,
                  and continued seriously:—
               "You shan't repent your confidence in me. The cursed red streaks shall come out of
                  my eyes and never to go in again. But," said he, pausing, and meditating a moment
                  thoughtfully; an idea had struck him; then continuing, "there is one thing that
                  passes my comprehension, but perhaps your ready wit has surmounted that also."
               "What is it?"
               "Where we are to live. Father has money enough, but he won't build me a house now,
                  and I don't blame him any."
               Salome smiled:—
               "O! we'll manage that easy enough. You told me after we had got into the stage to
                  come here that you had two hundred dollars. Your father sells at his mill on the
                  creek good sound common stuff boards at twenty dollars per M., and shingles at
                  three and a half dollars per bunch. One hundred dollars will put us up a very good
                  shantee on the Barker lot, and what there is left of the other hundred after this
                  journey, which I shall have enjoyed so much after we get home again, will buy a
                  small stove, a table, some dishes, and perhaps a few other things; meantime, we'll
                  be happy at father's while you are building the shantee."
               "Salome!" said Charley abruptly and most earnestly, when she had finished
                  speaking, "can you endure all this for my sake?"
               "O Charley! Charley! it is not endurance; it is happiness. But I
                  shall feel blessed to endure for your sake, anything that can occur if you'll only
                  be my good, true, kind husband!"
               "I will be! so help me God!" said Charley with wet eyes.
               And he has been. He has been a thorough farmer, and has not tasted liquor nor
                  played at billiards from that day to this. Of course he has had his temptations,
                  as all young men must who are breaking from old bad habits and taking up new, good
                  resolves.
               He and Salome had not been at home and married four days before his first
                  temptation came, and it came too in seductive, powerful form. When Meriden &
                  Co. made it known they were in receipt of their money, and when the foreman in the
                  car shops at West Albany had told his story, of course Charley quickly became
                  famous the whole length of the Central. High officials on the road took the matter
                  up and acted upon it at once. They decided that as he had always thoroughly done
                  his duty in the mail service, and as he was a very popular young man on the road
                  they would offer him something worth while.
               The result of their action was that Charley had not been happy with Salome four
                  days before a Superintendent, or something of that sort, of the Middle, or some
                  other division of the New York Central went out among the "everlasting" pine
                  stumps, sought him out, and offered him one of the most lucrative places on the road. I don't
                  know but they offered him the superintendency of one of the divisions—the salary
                  was, at least, I believe, about six thousand dollars a year.
               The company's agent when he came, found Charley at work on the shantee. After
                  congratulating him on the rescue of his character, he made known his errand.
               Charley, on hearing the alluring offer, dropped his hammer, stepped a few paces
                  away from the shantee, and called the official to come to him. He complied.
               Said Charley:—
               "You see that shantee going up there?"
               "Yes!"
               "Well! there is the most royal little woman in the world going into that shantee,
                  and I'm going to live with her. I've had railroading enough to last a
                  life-time."
               The answer did not at all please the agent; he knew that the young man was much
                  wanted, and he offered much argument trying to seduce him from the resolution he
                  either got by cheating his railroad friends, or that Salome had given him, or
                  perhaps from the two causes combined; but all the agent could get, was, that
                  Charley had had railroading enough to last.
               Charley was not to be lured away from his new hopes and joys—from his good
                  resolutions and the faithful young wife who had proved herself so worthy to
                  receive all he could give. He remained steadfast to the trust he had accepted,
                  compelling the company's agent to go away disappointed.
               He still remains on the Barker lot to which he and Salome removed from her
                  father's soon after the agent's visit; and next summer, his father now having
                  faith in his ability to resist temptations, is going to put up a nice house for
                  him and his sterling little wife, when they will bid a regretful adieu to the
                  humble shantee.
               Salome Bennett has found her great reward for her faithful hope in him, in
                  Charley's escape from the Perils of the Railroad, and in his present faithful
                  persistence in braving the Perils of the Plow Handles among the Pine Stumps.
