            An allegory
            
               CHAPTER I.
               THERE is a most singular cave on the Atlantic Coast, connected with which are some
                  of the most daring adventures and strange stories that were
                  ever known.
               And though the description will be meagre compared with its realties, yet, it will
                  be best to present what light we can, hoping that from so doing the reader will be
                  enabled to imagine the other untold facts.
               It was discovered in a very remarkable way, and had its discovery remained a
                  secret, the adventures and strange transactions to be related would never have
                  been told: while it is in and of itself, one of the greatest wonders in existence,
                  and all connected with it, whether of adventure or romance, partakes of the same
                  nature.
               Four men who had been out in an open boat fishing, about one mile from their
                  homes, which consisted of three small houses, were caught in a squall, and were
                  under the necessity of making for the nearest shore. They finally made for a small
                  cove-like opening in the side of the mountain-like shore, thinking to be free from
                  the wind, as after entering it, the space, after about twenty feet, became about
                  four times as wide as the entrance, which was about twenty feet wide, hence the
                  width, after entering the first twenty feet, became a fine little miniature bay or
                  cove.
               They had often visited this place for refuge or pleasure, but never at any other
                  time than about low water, at which time it was just deep enough for a boat to
                  float without grounding, and have several feet "sea room" either side; and above
                  their heads at the entrance, it was as high in comparison to the width after
                  entering, as the height to the width at entering: then, beside a fine little cove, it was much like
                  entering a dark house, for all the light was from the entrance; and as there was
                  plenty of "drift wood," they had on several occasions built a fire on the shore of
                  the cove to he enabled more fully to see its beauties and examine its size.
               On this occasion they at once did so, thinking to make themselves comfortable and
                  happy.
               But what was their consternation to remember that the tide was rising as well as
                  the wind and storm: for it commenced to come through the entrance like a race
                  horse, and to as suddenly rise as the squall had, extinguishing their fire.
               Securing a quantity of pitch pine, which makes a fine torch, for as the tide arose
                  it shut off the light, and as it arose far above the open space, it came in with a
                  deafening roar, which to the now imprisoned men appeared appalling.
               One of their number was inclined to seek escape through diving and swimming out,
                  but upon reflection saw that he could not go against such a current, though it
                  would have been an easy feat had the ride been going out: yet they had nothing to
                  fear, as the distance over head was far above the reach of high water, and having
                  their boat, and being provided with torches, they could go on an inspection tour
                  around the basin; and this they did, discovering the cave which we will now
                  describe.
               As they rowed around, they were much surprised to find on one side another open
                  space, just level with the top of their boat; and it was about twenty feet wide,
                  by about twelve feet high, about like the opening from the outside to the basin;
                  and having plenty of time on their hands, they thought it best to look
                  further.
               Landing, and taking a long rope to secure the boat, giving it sufficient play
                  should the tide ebb before they were through with their explorations, fastening it
                  securely to an upright stone pillar, apparently made for the purpose, with torch
                  in hand to light them on their way, they started forth to explore a natural
                  wonder.
               They passed through this hall-like entrance into another chamber: the entrance as
                  to size, length, termination and all was just like the one below, excepting the
                  water in one, and the stone column in the other, to which they had fastened their
                  boat.
               Still going on and around, they found another entrance about five feet above the
                  floor of the first; they succeeded in climbing into this, and in all particulars
                  it was the same as the other, excepting the stone column; and yet they found
                  another, making three above the basin.
               The atmosphere was good as on the open land, had the same appearance in all
                  respects, the smoke passing away as readily as though in open air, leading them to
                  think that there must be an outlet as well as an inlet; and looking sharply they
                  finally discovered an opening which they concluded led out above: it was like a
                  gradual winding stairs.
               Observing that there was a draft of air so powerful that they could not keep their
                  light, unless they could contrive some means to shut off the draft; this they in
                  part accomplished by forming of their jackets of oil cloth, a shield to the light.
                  In this way they come out upon the very pinnacle of the highest land on all the
                  coast for miles, and about half a mile from the shore.
               The outlet was slanting, just enough to be a comfortable up-hill walk, and in
                  width and depth as the inlet below.
               Finding it now quite clear, they concluded to go to the shore in the vicinity of
                  their boat, for they hardly felt like retracing their steps; they knew it would be
                  of no use to go direct, and also that they could not reach their boat but by
                  swimming or having another boat.
               As the outlet was in a great piece of woods, and among great rocks, and as there
                  were many places among them looking just like the land entrance to the cave, there
                  was but little probability of seeing or finding it without marking; this they did
                  for future guidance.
               Following the direction indicated by their pocket compass, they soon found
                  themselves at home; and after refreshing themselves, and resting sufficiently long
                  for the tide to recede, they, taking
                  another boat, went for the one they left, which they found all right; but they had
                  to sacrifice a portion of their rope, as the distance from the floor above to the
                  boat was more than they would like to jump; they therefore concluded to fasten a
                  small piece of drift wood to the portion left, to direct them at any future
                  time.
               Now, this place could be 
                     nade
                     made
                   into anything desired—a fort, a palace, or a den for pirates or
                  smugglers, or for any kind of good or evil purposes; and the reader will think it
                  was as wonderfully occupied as the wonderful cave required to correspond with
                  itself.
               Whether those four fishermen were the first who ever entered this wonderful place,
                  is unknown; but probably they were. It was never any advantage to them, other than
                  what we will now relate.
               In their vicinity, the population was very sparse; and before they had time to
                  gossip among their neighbors, they took a small lot of fish to the nearest market,
                  which was a small city a few miles distant; and while disposing of their fish,
                  they mentioned their discovery to a very distinguished looking man in the prime of
                  life.
               He told them to say nothing further of their discovery, and himself and a few
                  friends would visit the place, for they were curiosity hunting, and if it afforded
                  them enjoyment, they would pay them for the pleasure.
               Full arrangements were made, and next day the stranger, with three others, arrived
                  in a fine pleasure boat; and, accompanied by the fishermen, they went to explore
                  their singular discovery.
               Great satisfaction was expressed by the strangers upon concluding the examination
                  of the cave; and upon inquiry, they found the fishermen poor, unambitious men, as
                  willing to gain a livelihood by entering the employment of others as to fish with
                  and on their own hook.
               The strangers then made a bargain with them to enter their employment; and the
                  wages to be paid were so large that they were anxious to conclude the agreement.
                  Of course, the work was to be of that nature they could perform; but there were to
                  be obligations on their part, as well as on the part of the other men.
               The fishermen were now informed that they were organized discoverers of natural
                  curiosities, and the founders of cities; that all who entered their employ became
                  members of the order for discovering natural curiosities and founding cities. They
                  thought this a queer name for an order; but they concluded, if the name and
                  workings of the order corresponded, that the cave would prove a suitable
                  acquisition; and if their connection with the order proved profitable and
                  pleasant, they would be content.
               Accordingly, they were informed that they must be regularly initiated; to this
                  they readily complied.
               From the boat was brought a human skull, and a long pointed double-edged sword,
                  having in plain letters thereon, "the sword of justice."
               They were then requested to place their hand on the skull, and repeat the
                  following oath:—
               "I, in remembrance of the certainty of my own mortality, do solemnly pledge my own
                  life and soul, that I will keep the secrets of the order for the discovery of
                  natural curiosities and founding of cities inviolate till death, and will hold him
                  guiltless who shall pierce my heart with the sword of justice, should I break my
                  oath and perjure my soul, and will raise my own hand to slay the guilty."
               Each one in turn took this oath, and each were handed one hundred dollars in gold.
                  A password was then given them, which was the "sword of justice," with some
                  further instructions.
               After the ceremony, they were told that they might attend to their own business
                  for ten days; on the eleventh, they were to visit the cave in the same way as now,
                  at the earliest hour in the morning that the tide would serve them; to come
                     without light, and to climb up by the
                  rope, or the best way they could. This day arrived, and the four men kept their
                  appointment.
               Entering the cave on the flood tide, they sought, in the dim light, for the rope
                  they had left, and they were surprised to find what appeared to be a vessel's
                  shrouds; and by them, they, one after the other, ascended; and, as they passed
                  along, they were greeted by a loud command to halt, which they, in still further
                  surprise, did. They were then commanded to march in single file, ten paces apart,
                  and give the countersign. They followed this order also, one after the other
                  giving the password, as they had been instructed.
               And now another surprise awaited them, for at the inner termination of the
                  entrance, they came to a partition, a door was opened, and they entered the
                  extensive hall, at the farther side of which a small taper was burning; they were
                  told to cross to the light, and to ascend to the next hall; here they found
                  stairs; wondering and amazed, they proceeded, and again were met with the command
                  to halt; then to advance and give the countersign as before; after which they were
                  told to enter the hall of justice.
               They entered and were in total darkness, and in every direction in all parts of
                  the hall, a most singular noise met their ears; they were in a complete circle of
                  curious musical sounds, no harmony, as all seemed to play to suit their own fancy;
                  there were one hundred Jews-harps being played at once; this lasted about one
                  minute, then all in the circle spoke up, saying, "Let justice be done."
               And, in the twinkling of an eye, the great and spacious hall was so brilliantly
                  lighted, that all, the new comers especially, were obliged to shade their eyes
                  from a score of great lights on either side; with great magnificent reflectors,
                  the light was made exceedingly great.
               All was silence again for one minute, when a most gigantic man in a mask, with the
                  identical sword of justice in his hand, approached the four men and said,
                  "Strangers as yet to the sternness of the sword of justice, advance to the
                  altar."
               Great letters forming this word were painted on a very transparent cloth, which
                  was stretched in front of a bright light, clearly showing where was indicated for
                  them to appear.
               Here, on a table, was the identical skull upon which these men had placed their
                  hands when taking the oath, and the same giant, who was about eight feet tall, and
                  large in proportion, again addressed them in the following manner:
               "Place your hands on the emblem of mortality, and answer my questions."
               Here they all placed their hands on the skull.
               "You will answer each for himself, just as you choose."
               "Have you kept inviolate your sacred oath?"
               He here drew the sword of justice as though in readiness to slay them, should they
                  reply in the negative; but each replied, "I have."
               He then asked them, they still holding their hands on the emblem of mortality, "Do
                  you renew your oath?"
               To which they all said, "I do."
               "Do you regret having entered the order for the discovery of natural curiosities,
                  and founding of cities?"
               "I do not."
               "Do you regret that you discovered this great natural curiosity, the cave?"
               "I do not," they each replied.
               He next said, "brothers sing," and one of the best songs, thought the fishermen,
                  that they had ever heard, was sung by a score of voices.
               The giant then gave a sort of kick, and sent two feet or more of his height, with
                  his sailor-like trowsers, half way across the hall; he then removed a large padded
                  coat and his mask, and then stood before the astonished men, the fine looking ing man who had first been informed of
                  the cave; and grasping each by the hand, the meeting was most cordial.
               Calling each by name, he introduced them as the original discoverers of the cave;
                  "and in their honor," he added, "we will now repair to the upper banqueting hall,
                  and spend a few hours."
               They then went up the next flight of stairs, and passed through the hall entrance,
                  which was brilliantly lighted, to the spacious hall above, which was as
                  magnificently lighted as the one below, and beside, it had been floored and richly
                  carpeted and most elegantly furnished with all kinds of furniture that could be
                  named, even to a piano, and all the luxuries that could be brought together.
               The halls were warmed by a large and substantial stove placed in the centre of the
                  middle hall, with a large funnel reaching to the height of ten feet, then
                  extending along to the next hall entrance, through which it passed, and through
                  the next hall, and on, all the way up and out of the steep and winding way to the
                  outer world, completely warming the second and third apartments, and all the
                  passage way out.
               And to as fine a repast as could be provided; they all sat down; consisting of all
                  kinds of meat, fish and fowl, and a rare dessert; everything desirable that money
                  could procure, and taste desire, was on the occasion in abundance. In fact, it was
                  the dedication of the great, grand establishment.
               Untold gold and a hundred men could do a great deal in a few days, and to
                  celebrate the occasion with conferring the second degree on the initiates, was
                  very proper and calculated to impress the new recruits that the greatest of secret
                  organizations was a stupendous reality.
               After doing justice to the food and injustice to their stomachs, they proceeded to
                  do injustice to their heads, by freely using the juice of the grape and other
                  kinds of costly drinks, and in story-telling with toasts and songs, they spent
                  quite a large portion of the day.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               Now we must say something more about this wonderful place, and will begin with the
                  shore entrance.
               They built a huge gate for the entrance, and by two upright iron posts, and a
                  cross piece at the top for a frame to the gate, this was securely bolted to the
                  wall on either side, so that it was quite as firm as the rock itself; the gate was
                  now hung on its huge hinges on the cross piece, so that it could swing in or out
                  as the tide might be going.
               The gate was placed half-way within the entrance, or about ten feet from the
                  outside; it worked like magic; on the floodtide, it looked but a shallow place,
                  not suitable for a boat, and the same on the ebb-tide.
               On the inside they had a powerful windlass and chain, which they could hook into a
                  ring on the gate and draw it up and keep it open when desirable; though, on
                  pressing against it very slightly, it yielded readily and would go with the tide,
                  allowing the water to pass in or out as though no gate was there; and to finish
                  the gate, they had the frame and all painted, and so disguised that it looked like
                  the natural appearance of the surrounding wall, and a stranger would not observe
                  that it was not a part of the mountain side.
               Inside, the space was about eighty feet, either way, being plenty of room for
                  dozens of boats, both large and small; after the gate was hung or put up, it was
                  darker than ever, yet they had plenty of light when they required it; the shrouds
                  were drawn up when not in use; the land entrance did not require any disguise,
                  though they carefully made it more difficult of approach.
               The three halls or separate caves, which were all connected by a passage-way,
                  twenty feet wide, were now more fully prepared for occupancy.
               
               The first was called the golden room, for here was where the stores were
                  deposited, consisting of everything of value that could be named; the other rooms
                  we will more fully describe.
               The third room, or banqueting hall, was divided into various rooms, the cooking
                  arrangement and a part of the sleeping apartments were here, while in the hall of
                  justice were many cots, in fact, from the water, where dozens of boats lay, to the
                  outer passage, the place was fully occupied.
               Perhaps it might be thought an unhealthy place for a dwelling, but they had pure
                  air constantly and could have the temperature of the place to suit them; besides
                  they were out and in, not constantly confined, though it was one of the most
                  healthy dwellings that existed, more so than many large houses, and infinitely
                  more so than those places of human degradation, under-ground dwellings, and
                  prison-like houses of the poor.
               We now see this wonderful place fixed up to suit its occupants and owners, and
                  will now interest ourselves about the workings of this order.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               In this organization were several officers, whose duty it was to have charge of a
                  certain department; in this way everything went on like clock work; the officers
                  were changed as often as the correct working of the cause demanded, while the
                  leader held his position for four years.
               The President had about as much power as a king.
               His counsellors were talented men, seven in number, and each filled a distinct
                  office, and by having all the different departments attended to, the prosperity of
                  the establishment was great.
               The four fishermen were commissioned watchmen, two to watch by day and two by
                  night, and before they had been members of the order one month, they concluded
                  that the part of the name of the order which came first, was a very correct one,
                  for the curiosities and wonders that were brought together fairly surprised
                  them.
               About the men going and coming that did not seem strange, for both night and day
                  they were ever busy.
               One day the four fishermen were requested to go out for fish, and were informed
                  that Indians were about, and they were cautioned and told to be on their guard;
                  but they had no fears, for they were on the best of terms with them, for they had
                  done them a favor once; when their chief was wounded they had secreted him from
                  other Indians, his enemies, so they had their friendship all right; still, it
                  would not do to let them learn of the cave and the new affairs therein, for
                  Indians are greater skulking thieves than Negroes, if possible.
               But this day was an unfortunate one for them.
               They had got well out and began to fish with fine prospects, when they discovered
                  three canoes of Indians at a distance, and fearing that they might not be the
                  friendly ones who generally came in that direction, though seldom any others came,
                  they started for the shore, and the Indians at once gave their favorite war-whoop,
                  and started in pursuit; but our lusty fishermen had a good start, and while the
                  Indians were yet one mile or more off, they plunged into their safe retreat, for
                  fortunately it was flood tide, for an hour or so.
               The four men remained just inside to hear what was the opinion of the savages.
               Presently they came up, and in broken English sputtered away after this sort:
               "Pale faces fools; scare him dreadful; go bang against rock; big fools; old boat
                  rotten; too much ballast; go to bottom."
               They then looked about to see if they could make any discoveries of the boat or
                  men, but failing, soon left, and our fishermen leaving their boat, hastened up
                  through the cave, and running with great speed along the shore, suddenly showed
                  themselves to the Indians, and, being armed with fowling pieces, they gave them a charge of small shot, as they
                  wished not to kill, but to punish and frighten them.
               But they were more frightened to see them come back from the bottom of the sea
                  than by the shooting; they appeared to think they had charmed lives, or were
                  devils, and as they never returned, it was concluded that the trick had its
                  desired effect on them.
               Why this organization should admit these fishermen to their order looked very
                  strange, but upon reflection, we can understand it; they needed such men; they
                  knew of the cave, and to secure their silence and private possession of it,
                  induced them to take this, the only wise and safe course; and having removed their
                  families to the city named before, they could give their undivided attention to
                  their duties.
               Who these men were, or whence they came, the fishermen knew not, and cared but
                  little; they were now members; to go back they would surely perish, to continue
                  seemed all right; they were certain of several things; they possessed untold
                  wealth, and they saw nothing out of the way; the chief was an inveterate smoker,
                  and seemed to be absorbed in thought while smoking.
               His history and name were a little odd; he was not ashamed of it though; in fact,
                  the name of the order was singular, and how much the workings of the order were in
                  accordance with it they had not yet learned; "but what is in a name?"
               We now find this most wonderful cave occupied, it being completely transformed,
                  and the order for the discovery of natural curiosities and founding of cities in
                  complete working order.
               We will now notice several things connected with this mysterious cave.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               One day, at the close of the duties, the watchman saw a great, grand ship
                  approaching under full sail, with three curious flags flying to the breeze.
               One was pure red, having the emblem of the sun; one was pure white with the moon
                  for an emblem; while the other was pure blue, having the stars.
               They had noticed in the cave just such flags, and consequently thought the ship
                  connected with the order; and when they came in proper distance they took in sail
                  and cast anchor, and then immediately discharged a small swivel.
               Making full report of their observations to the President, they were ordered to
                  row out to the ship and take any message back that they might have to send
                  ashore.
               They obeyed orders, and as they approached the ship they were hailed and ordered
                  alongside, and were surprised to see one of their own officers on board.
               He at once handed them letters to be taken back.
               And the affair wound up by the fishermen being ordered to pilot the ship in as
                  near to the shore as possible, after which they and all hands on board, with all
                  those within the cave, manned all the boats, and made a lively time in taking to
                  the shore the cargo of the ship quite as fast as it could be discharged.
               It consisted of every nameable kind of goods, valuable packages, and bales of dry
                  goods, and everything a great establishment required.
               They were several days in effecting a full discharge, and a safe storage within
                  the cave, and as they had worked both night and day till they had the job done,
                  they felt like having a good time, and accordingly did so, for it proved that all
                  on board the ship were members.
               Soon the ship left for parts unknown, at least to the fishermen, which led them to
                  think they were not fully trusted, but
                  they could not complain as they were from the first employed, and their connection
                  was more like an honorary one.
               One day a letter was handed to one of the fishermen with directions to take it to
                  Vice President Indiana.
               He was told to go one mile north, following what was called a spotted line, that
                  is, trees with a piece of the bark shaved off close enough together in a direct
                  line, so that one could follow it as well as a road, and when he came to a tree
                  having a spot on all four sides, he was to turn to the right and go another mile
                  to the city of Columbia.
               Setting forth with his gun that he might shoot any game he might happen to see, in
                  an hour or so, he, following the spotted line which he did not know existed
                  before, till he came to the tree spotted on either side, he then turned to the
                  right, and after going about one mile he came to a settlement that he knew did not
                  exist six months before this time.
               He was confounded; it is true the houses were new, most of them made of logs; and
                  a grand location it was for a city, on a large river emptying into the ocean, at
                  the mouth of which was as fine a bay as exists on the face of the globe, and by
                  water quite a number of miles from the cave, while across by land it was but a
                  short distance.
               Our fisherman began to think the name of the order a correct one.
               As he passed along he saw a sign which read Superintendent's Office, and to
                  inquire he approached the door for that purpose, and found himself in the presence
                  of the Vice President, and to him he delivered the letter, and soon took one in
                  return, and observed the superscription was to his "Honor President Illinois."
               He learned two of the leaders' names and began to feel interested about the names
                  of the others, and he soon had an opportunity to learn them too.
               After reporting upon his return, he found plenty to do.
               He was informed next day that he could visit the city where they first met the
                  president, to take letters to several now absent. One of these was addressed to
                  the Hon. Mr. Whale.
               "Well," soliloquized he, "Mr. Whale would make a good fisherman if he chose to
                  adopt that calling, though, perhaps he is one now, comparatively, he, being a
                  Whale, lives on little fishes, maybe." This officer looked after the interest of
                  the order away from home.
               Another was to Hon. Mr. Swells. He looked after the department of the sea, and he
                  too had a watery name—"Swell of the sea."
               Another was Hon. Mr. Gunpowder. He looked after the arms and ammunition; and it
                  was very singular that his name and office were so similar in meaning.
               Hon. Mr. Interiorman was another, and he looked after the affairs of the great
                  order at home.
               Hon. Mr. Lawgiver was another; he saw that everything was done according to
                  law.
               One was addressed, Hon. Mr. Informationman; whose duty was to see that all letters
                  and mail matter were duly delivered.
               Hon. Mr. Vault was another officer, making seven in all, beside the President and
                  Vice President. He had charge of all the gold, like Judas of old, and was as great
                  a man as any.
               The fisherman began to think that the officers of the order were as peculiarily
                  named as the order.
               Arriving safely he delivered the letters, for following directions he had no
                  trouble in finding them; he had seen them all before, but as his duties did not
                  bring him into close business relation, he had not learned their names.
               Upon his return he had quite a long chat with his three old chums; he had visited
                  all their families, as some one of them did every week, so that they all went home
                  once a month.
               And as they usually discussed the affairs of the great cave, its management, its
                  officers, their merits, and the probability of success in its various departments,
                  just as the common people ever do the condition of their country, its prosperity
                  or adversity, and also the capacity of their rulers, he delivered himself in this
                  wise to his interested brother fishermen:
               "Boys, do you know that this organization of ours is destined to fill the whole earth with its glory?" One of the
                  others replied:
               "As to this organization, I do not know about that; if it had not been for us
                  common fellows and our discovery of the cave, I guess we should not be much
                  greater than other organizations of the world in different parts, of which we have
                  heard so much; and though it was us common men that discovered the foundation for
                  this greatness, I guess we shall not be much better off for it after all, for
                  though we belong to the order and are under all the oaths and obligations, and do
                  all the watching and common work, it don't seem to benefit us much.
               "Of course we have a home, so do all the common poor of other orders in all parts
                  of the world, but you see though we got a start at first just like the settlers in
                  a new country, where are we now?
               "Why we work night and day, and when we have paid our rent, which is enormous, and
                  bought all other necessary things, settling once a month, it takes all we can earn
                  to make our families comfortable; and while we beat the bush others will catch the
                  bird.
               "Our President, for one, will become very wealthy, you see; I believe that that
                  whole cargo of goods came free of duty, but they don't come any cheaper to us, and
                  I begin to think that the President and that big Whale and those others in office,
                  are getting all the cream, while we poor wretches get the skimmed milk, and
                  watered at that.
               "I should like to know how much the rest of the order receives that are not office
                  holders of the higher grade—I mean all hands belonging to the order—they seem to
                  be happy men; they discuss the merits of everything, and have a great task in
                  making the laws of the order, and seeing to everything generally; overhauling his
                  old Whaleship terribly, thinking that he don't feel so much interest to have the
                  organization grow in greatness, and true glory, as he does to make money out of
                  the position he is in.
               "They think he don't throw his whole soul into the office he fills, as they think
                  its interests demand, and the President of the great cave, though elected to the
                  greatest office in the gift of the order, with the expectation that he would be
                  very energetic, seems to be satisfied to let everything go about as it may,
                  thinking that his officers will receive all the blame and he still hoard up great
                  riches.
               "Then the Hon. Mr. Vault, he is named about well enough, for he has
                  charge of the great vaults of the cave, and locks up all the revenues that come
                  in, and pretends that there is only a proper amount on hand, and therefore keeps
                  turning everything into money for the sake of being the richest organization on
                  earth.
               "But those whose duty lead them to look after the interests of all think that
                  while the officers have so much gold, more than they can count, that the common
                  people ought to have an opportunity to lay up something for themselves, too.
               "Yet the leaders cry out that there are great expenses to be met in founding
                  cities, securing new curiosities, and to pay off other expenses of the order with
                  the money, though what debts were standing against the organization were not yet
                  due, and the pinching wants of the poor might be relieved by less taxation and all
                  bills met when due, but as it was in the hearts of those in power to oppress the
                  poor, this course would be thought excusable.
               "I tell you we four men are not all who need a change, and I hope that one of
                  those men who go after the big ones will be elected to office in due time; then we
                  will see better times.
               "Then while some endure all things in hope of having their turn in office, and
                  others hammer away to bring around the joyful day of justice, we must live in
                  hope."
               We see by this condition of things as described by the fishermen, that the
                  greatest organization in the world, with the greatest cave on earth for a
                  favorable development of their great strength and beauty, may grow or
                  diminish.
               
               But as there is not a person on earth without a fault, nor an organization without
                  an error, and as men may grow good or bad, so a great organization may become more
                  perfect and its glory shine brighter, or it may imperceptibly degenerate, and its
                  retrograde at last be seen; therefore we hear the voice of warning, or of praise,
                  as the case may be, for men will not keep silent; we then witness a natural
                  result.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               The new city soon became a world in miniature, consisting of all nations and
                  religions, and covering an extensive tract of country, and where the land entrance
                  of the cave existed stands one of the greatest and most magnificent houses in all
                  the country.
               It is from the foundation to the top black, consequently it is known as the Black
                  House; it is very capacious, while its underground arrangements are very superior
                  to those of any other. So we find everything in a prosperous condition but the
                  common people.
               The President, by virtue of his office, was respected and greeted by all as though
                  the existence of all things depended upon his will; and some thought the great
                  organization in all its departments, with the flourishing condition of the great
                  city of Columbia, was owing to his greatness; but others thought very
                  differently.
               Whatever the policy of the order might be in reference to administering its laws
                  for the purpose of enriching itself, or by dealing in a sharp manner with
                  foreigners, or unjustly taxing its members, the President and his officers did not
                  allow any one, great or small, to attack the policy they thought best to adopt.
                  Though they might be in an error, they would not allow their position in any
                  particular to be assailed. The opponent might be superior in every sense, and
                  capable of criticising the acts of the chief magistrate of the order, or his
                  subordinates; such daring men would be placed in the background, and all the
                  opportunities wherein such fearless champions for the right could be of great
                  assistance, they were ever prevented, if possible, for fear their influence might
                  become too great.
               Thus things began to be quite out of joint.
               It was soon learned that the President of the order was a mere figure-head; that
                  when he was really weighed, or tested, that he was found very deficient.
               Whether it was his almost constant habit of smoking, that had changed the man, and
                  made him very inferior, or whether he was always an inferior man, we cannot say;
                  perhaps the organization had grown beyond his abilities—hence his inferiority was
                  seen. How he came to be elected to the great office we suppose was in this
                  wise.
               There were capable men in the order, many of whom would have made a good
                  President; but they thought best to select a man who might be the most available,
                  on account of not having been previously engaged in meddling with the workings of
                  the order, and then they could make a Lion of him, by reason of his great office,
                  though he could not make the office great,—though, like many others, he was great
                  in his own peculiar calling.
               He was a great swordsman, having been taught the art of fencing by his Uncle Sam.,
                  Americus. And it is best for all men to seek greatness in their own sphere; then
                  they may excel. And as he had been brought into notice by his greatness in
                  accomplishing the defeat of a set of rascals who had established themselves in
                  such an antagonistical position to the order, that the excitement on the discovery
                  of the plot and its overthrow by him raised such an enthusiastic gratitude, that,
                  in their haste to reward him for his good turn, promoted him to the great
                  office.
               The enthusiasm of the impulsive put him there, not his adaptation for the office; therefore, it was one
                  constant struggle to control him in his new position.
               Such a head of the order, while controlled by the great Whale and other officers,
                  would so act under their directions, they being all self, that the body of the
                  membership would rebel, and raise their voices against the manner the order was
                  worked, for avariciousness appeared to be one of the ruling passions of the
                  managing department.
               Hence, ships were sent abroad to fetch back stores, while officers were appointed
                  to visit all the people throughout the city of Columbia, to gather tithes from
                  all; so that the rich, feeling oppressed, would make the poor pay double the rent
                  and double prices for all kinds of necessaries of life. Such extortion caused the
                  people to cry aloud for reform, they feeling that, had the head of the order stood
                  up for the rights of the people, that this state of things could not have come to
                  pass.
               Crushing the poor, and enriching a few, was wrong policy. Raising up the poor, by
                  having all things equal, as they used to, was a better one.
               What made it so very distressing, was the President's unwise use of his almost
                  monarchical power.
               He had very much changed since his election to office. He had been taught in his
                  youth that those in authority were like a general of an army, his own opinion
                  being the correct guide, and independent of the people he would have his own
                  way.
               This idea he had still, and thought to carry it out. It was a pity that his Uncle
                  Sam., Americus, taught him in this way, for it made him like a balky horse or
                  mule, though the most contrary beast will go when they want to. So he was ever
                  ready for any enterprise that met his views; but if anything was proposed that did
                  not, or had no interest for him, he would smoke away, puff! puff! and let them
                  talk on, and fret away. As they could not act without him, he was bound to have
                  his way so long as he was in power; for when his term of office expired, he might,
                  or he might not, be re-elected. But as he had become wealthy, it was not so
                  important on his own account, yet anxiety, like excitement, is a condition of mind
                  that may pass from one to another.
               Consequently, those selfish intriguing office-holders were anxious to have him
                  re-elected, for they too wished to make a fortune; and they were aware, that
                  should some one be elected to the Presidency from the number of those who were so
                  clamorous for justice, that they would have a poor prospect of reappointment to
                  office; hence President and counsellors became anxious for his re-election.
               This subject now became the every day topic, and all arguments, by both those in
                  favor of conducting the order on the same principles for four years more, and
                  those who desired a change, that could be brought forward, were so constantly
                  agitated, that they were all learned by heart.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               About this time other orders of very distinct laws and management of their
                  internal affairs, were unfortunate enough to become involved in the affairs of the
                  order for the discovery of curiosities and founding cities, and the President and
                  his advisers were perplexed in managing the difficulty.
               It had ever been the rule of the various orders, for each one to mind his own
                  affairs; and if they did not, to so hold them up to public scorn, that they would
                  be ashamed of their acts, and soon seek reconciliation, for though distinct
                  orders, it was no reason one should say, "we are right, and you are wrong," for it
                  is often the case that all are both right and wrong in some respects.
               But the President and his officers appeared to think that in all things, money was
                  the object, hence, to settle any affair that did not prove to their advantage,
                  might as well remain unsettled.
               
               So, at this time, it was constant turmoil without, and great dissatisfaction
                  within, the cave.
               The time had now come that it would be safe to allow all who wished to visit this
                  wonderful part of creation to do so.
               Great was the wonder of all, when they beheld the natural grandeur of the cave,
                  and vast hoards of wealth in every conceivable form; showing clearly the ability
                  of the President to live in his present style.
               He lived like a prince, and his fine equippage might be coveted by a king.
               Who earned all this?
               The fact was, the order knew no more about its funds, than though there were none.
                  We will listen to the fishermen as they again express their minds.
               "Boys, how much do you suppose I have saved the past few years, since we joined
                  the order?"
               They replied, "Not much I guess, with your family of wife and nine children."
               "Well, boys, as I live, I have not saved one dollar; we have just lived; my rent
                  is so high, and all kinds of provisions, that when we pay off all the bills, I am
                  just where I was when I used to fish for a living. I think we would have been
                  wiser, if we had secured a share of the profits. I shall go in for a change at any
                  rate, so long as I can vote."
               To this they all heartily agreed, and each replied that their comrade had told
                  their own story.
               One of them remarked, "I think it strange that the President and his counsellors
                  have such an influence with so large a portion of the order."
               "Not in the least," exclaimed another, "you see, some one or more of the order are
                  relatives to these men in office, so they, who are in power, and called the
                  'insiders,' because they control the money and all the offices, and administer the
                  whole affairs of the great cave, have everything their own way; from the highest
                  to the lowest, all work together, and so make the largest part of the order.
               "But if all who do not desire any benefit from the finances, are as many in
                  proportion beyond our acquaintance, as there are within our knowledge, I would not
                  wonder, if we rally every man, we succeeded in effecting a change in the
                  administration of our affairs.
               "There is one thing about it, as all are permitted to see the inside of the cave,
                  I think the ladies, in particular, will see where the great wealth of the order
                  is, how it has been used, and how it will be likely to be, if there is not a
                  change.
               "Well, boys, I am determined to invite my wife and nine children over here next
                  week, when I go home, and I advise you to do the same; there is nothing like
                  enlightening the people, and the women will be better than a newspaper to spread
                  the real truth broadcast over all sections.
               "And when the women of our members see the great riches of our chief and his
                  officers, and realize how short a time they have been in securing their wealth,
                  they then will see why we all have been compelled to pay double price for every
                  article we have consumed, though it is pretended that we owe other orders large
                  sums of money, and that we owe debts of honor, which is all pretence, that they
                  may have an excuse to use extortion."
               The very next week various common people saw for themselves that while they had
                  been groaning with poverty's pinching want, others were groaning under the load of
                  hoarded wealth, fretting for fear of thieves, and seeking new avenues to spend
                  money, or to put it at interest in new ways.
               One old lady exclaimed: "Why, I declare, when our President was first elected to
                  office he was as poor as a poor fisherman, and now he is as rich as a king."
               "I don't wonder that while he, with his family, can live in such grandeur, having
                  the great Black House to live in, all free, and we have to pay such rent, that it
                  shows the cause for such a contrast.
               "I guess if he would take my husband's place, and his wife my place, that they would very soon wish a change
                  in the administration of the order; I wonder the men endure it; I know we women
                  would not if we could vote; and I am certain that to see the organization in such
                  a condition is enough to drive any lady of just indignation to any extreme that
                  might have a tendency to bring the high down and to bring up the crushed.
               "Why I have known of as fine families as our chief's, or as they ever were or ever
                  will be, who have been so embarrassed financially that they have been compelled to
                  go to the dispensary for medical advice, though hitherto having a plenty, and all
                  because our chief and his counsellors make it impossible to live in comfort."
               Now, these were the common people, and they concluded that why the President was
                  so highly pleased with the cave in the first place was that it would make a grand
                  place for him to hoard up riches, and to retain this office another term of four
                  years, he could use a great fortune to influence votes, and then have plenty left,
                  though it would look a little weak to have to resort to such means, yet it would
                  be better than to be defeated, and all his counsellors, with a promise that they
                  should remain in office, would do all in their power, for, while working for him,
                  they were working for themselves; and the same arrangement was also made with all
                  the minor officeholders.
               Though it would be a little risky to buy votes, yet a present to a man would make
                  him feel as though he could not vote against such a friend any more than though he
                  held an office.
               He would very much dislike to make a fight and then fail, and as the time
                  approached he thought it best to use a little strategy to secure his
                  re-election.
               Accordingly he made a bluster about the high rates of taxation, as though he was
                  in favor of a repeal of those obnoxious and severe measures so oppressive to the
                  people, while it was privately understood that no material change must be made,
                  Then the people would think he saw the importance of a change for their benefit,
                  so give him their support again.
               This apparently was the course he was taking, and it might have done very well had
                  not the ladies in every direction taken up the subject, and so clamored for
                  justice that the men generally found that if for no other than to appease their
                  "women folks," that they would be compelled to vote for a change.
               Hence we see, that though the women cannot vote, that they control the polls, and
                  therefore the destinies of the order and the future occupancy of the Black House,
                  and the great cave, for storing riches, were to be disposed of indirectly by
                  them.
               But if any one thought that the stupid, indifferent chief of the cave was not
                  sufficient to the occasion, they "reckoned without their host."
               While others were anxious, he would puff, puff, at his "long nine," and study out
                  what could not be arrived at in haste.
               "Nothing like indifference to the turmoil of the common people" he would say; yet
                  he kept himself well prepared for anything favorable that might "turn up."
               He was crafty as well as a great smoker.
               There were men in the order that were as much superior in abilities to him in
                  every respect as a learned statesman is to an ignorant, self-willed, old fogy
                  Chinaman.
               And it was of vast importance to his interests that such men be snubbed in their
                  own aspirations and zeal for the welfare of the order.
               Several of these men were the projectors and the establishers and developers of
                  the great, grand order, and stood in about equal importance to the general order
                  as the first discoverers of the cave.
               Hence, while they were at work hammering away trying to modify laws and bring
                  about a favorable change for the general good, they had the respect, love, and
                  influence of the common people.
               Therefore, for the party in power to succeed, it was important that these should
                  be shorn of their strength.
               
               To effect this, they were charged with all kinds of short-comings and deviations
                  from the correct course good and true members should follow; consequently,
                  whenever important enterprises that involved the interests of all were under
                  consideration, and upon which all had a right to express their mind, these men
                  were so crowded and insulted by being called to order in debate, or refused the
                  opportunity to act on the subject under discussion as referees, or insinuations
                  expressed as to their real object in taking the stand they would, they had but a
                  poor opportunity to throw their whole strength into the cause of general good.
               But the subtle old smoker did not think it best to stop here.
               Though they were brothers of the same order, and sworn to be faithful to the
                  secrets of the order, and were under the same constitution and laws, yet the same
                  door to promotion being open to all, it followed, of course, that they had a
                  right, both moral and legal, to do the best they could in accomplishing their
                  object—the election of their favorite; and had they only thus far gone, it would
                  have been better.
               But unscrupulous men will resort to any means to accomplish their object, for it
                  is a well-known fact that if a man may act wrong in one particular, so he may in
                  others, and feel as well satisfied with himself as when using dishonest means for
                  his own aggrandizement; in other respects, then, he who would crush the poor to
                  enrich himself in money or a great name, will do anything else to gain that object
                  upon which he has cast his whole soul.
               What a misfortune to this great order that its chief did not remain where he bore
                  an honored name and was beloved by all, for though a large portion held him in
                  high esteem for his office sake, quite as many now scorned his present career and
                  as greatly desired a change or the close of his term of office, as they had been
                  to promote him to it.
               And it will hardly be credited that very unscrupulous means were resorted 
                     to to
                     to
                   accomplish the ruin of others that he might succeed.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               There was one champion of the oppressed and downtrodden named Solomon, and he was
                  rightly named, though perhaps not so wise as Solomon of old, yet he could be
                  called a second Solomon with propriety. This man thought more of the general good
                  of the order than he did of his personal advantage or the benefit of a few.
               It was important that he should become powerless or a change in the government of
                  the order would be certain.
               One day the chief addressed one of the fishermen in a rather more social way than
                  is common for such men, and said:
               "I wish you would find another cave like this one, excepting the outlet, though I
                  would like to have one that could be closed up with a gate or heavy door.
               "And I wish it known only to the discoverers; and as you had such good fortune in
                  finding this one, I conclude you have a faculty for such an undertaking. I will
                  procure you and your comrades a furlough for a week, that you may make the effort;
                  and if you are lucky in the attempt, I will give you each a fine house in the new
                  city, though its existence to all others but those I choose to inform must remain
                  a secret.
               "Now, if on these conditions you will fact, let me know tomorrow."
               He then shook hands for the second time as he left, just as interested great men
                  are wont to do about election time with the common people.
               The proposition was fully discussed that evening by the four men, and they
                  concluded that they would undertake the enterprise, as it was honorable, and, if
                  successful, would prove to their advantage.
               They did not know what such a cave was wanted for, but concluded for secret party
                  caucusing.
               
               But they reported to his chieftainship that they would make the effort; they could
                  but fail.
               "Now," said the great smoker, as he blew the puffs of smoke away, "you must
                  remember your oath."
               "Remember our oath; what oath, your excellency?"
               "Why your oath to hold inviolate the secrets of the order of which you are
                  members."
               "As to that, most certainly, though we did not know that this affair was a secret
                  of the order."
               "I pronounce it so; am I not the chief? Do I not represent the order?"
               "All right, your honor; we will remember and obey."
               "Now, boys," said the leader of the four—he always thus addressed them—"I supposed
                  it was a secret of our Chief Magistrate. At any rate, I so understood him
                  yesterday, as none were to know of it but those he chose to inform; I, thinking it
                  wanted for a sort of private room for preparing the work to be done during the
                  campaign; and he now tells us that it is a secret of the order. Then, of course,
                  it as much belongs to one as another of our members; and as no oath requires us to
                  keep secret what belongs to the general order, like anything else holden in
                  common, we can take counsel in reference to it, if we choose, though, if we
                  succeeded, the cave, it seems, was to be appropriated by the President's chosen
                  ones, like other things."
               "But we will start on our voyage of discovery, and act in accordance with our own
                  inclinations."
               They set forth, and after visiting every high rocky shore, and many islands, they
                  found just the place they wanted, though different from the other.
               It was on an island of considerable size, densely wooded, while the small growth
                  and vines, with "under-brush," made progress almost impossible.
               A large bird named Fish Hawk completely covered the trees with their nests; on
                  some of the trees every branch had one or more.
               Hundreds and thousands of these large birds swarmed the entire island, giving to
                  the place one of the most forsaken spots on earth, so far as human existence goes;
                  and in climbing over rocks and through almost impregnable thickets, frightening
                  clouds of birds, while thousands of half-fledged ones stretched their long necks
                  and tottering long legs, to see the cause of so great a fuss among the old ones,
                  they came to a curious opening in the side of the hill.
               It was sufficiently large to allow all four to walk abreast for ten or twelve
                  paces, after which it was about wide enough for two, for about the same distance;
                  it then extended in all directions about one hundred feet.
               Concluding it just the place they needed, as its advantages were that it was high
                  and dry, and about ten rods from the shore, and also from the wild appearance of
                  the place, seldom, if ever, visited;—they took a chart of it rudely drawn, so that
                  its whereabouts could be easily found among the various islands, though the
                  numerous birds would be a good guide, as this island alone appeared to be
                  appropriated by them, no others containing any. They returned to report.
               Though they were very jubilant over their discovery, in anticipation of the good
                  fortune to them, yet they were sorely puzzled about its belonging to the order, if
                  the order were to know nothing about it.
               Their spokesman again expressed himself:
               "I wish the honorable Mr. Solomon had been at home before we started, for he would
                  have explained all the particulars to us, for he is not so reticent as our
                  Chief.
               "But, as it is, we will go to him about it, if we feel a doubt about our promised
                  houses; perhaps, too, he will yet explain why the order needs another cave. Maybe
                  they intend to have it for a private storehouse."
               Thus talking, as folks will, about everything they don't understand more than
                  those things they can fathom, they arrived; and the leader repaired to the
                  Executive presence, to lay before his Honor their success.
               He made the report, as we have seen it, and was thanked and told that all the deeds should be made out the next
                  day, and cautioned him about its being known.
               While their friend was absent, the Hon. Mr. Solomon happened to pass that way, and
                  being on social terms with them, he accosted them, and inquired after
                  their comrade, and was informed of his errand to the Chief, with all the
                  particulars of the agreement, their good fortune, with a full and complete
                  description of the island. And as they were the original discoverers of the island
                  cave, they were the legitimate owners, as they had been of the great cave, they
                  were the legitimate owners, as they had been of the great cave now belonging to
                  their order.
               He was very much surprised at the President's freak, and could see no sense in
                  such a purchase; and had the scheme been introduced into public meeting of the
                  order, he would have inquired into the propriety of it, and that he should offer
                  four houses belonging to the general organization for an island of wild trees and
                  thousands of Fish Hawks, only because it contained a cave, was as much a riddle to
                  him as ever old Bible Solomon found to puzzle him, and to see through it he would
                  really need the wisdom of his old namesake.
               Now the "pet scheme of the President" was a one-sided affair, and a little
                  underhanded, though his reasons for gaining possession of this worthless spot were
                  to be learned to the regret of those who stood in his way.
               He took rather too much on himself when he undertook the scheme of buying this
                  little island.
               It was the cave he wanted, and he had saved enough to buy the (to him) wonderful
                  place, and more too.
               But he intended to pay out of the funds as though he was "all in all." Perhaps he
                  wanted the place, that he might set up a new order when he should find himself out
                  of office; and perhaps he did not.
               But the subject was brought up at the next general meeting, and a more surprised
                  man than his excellency never lived to find his action in the premises criticized,
                  and completely over-thrown by the Hon. Mr. Solomon.
               Let his intention be what it might, he felt so much chagrin at his failure, that
                  he resolved to seek revenge on his opponents, though he knew that Mr. Solomon had
                  the general good at heart, yet he had no right, thought his greatness, to cross
                  his path; and to remove him was now as great a desire as to possess the Island,
                  for he considered him a dangerous rival in the order, as he was a great man, and,
                  should he be elected to the highest office, he would make it greater still in
                  dignity by his own greatness; he was a statesman understanding all things
                  pertaining to any position he might occupy.
               The President determined to carry out his first plan, and again sent for the
                  fisherman, and stated to him that he would like to visit the Island, with some
                  friends.
               Accordingly they made a trip to the Island, and the enormous number of birds so
                  very much surprised the President, that he took another segar, and lighting it
                  took a seat on a mossy bowlder for a smoke, the others following his example, so
                  far as sitting down; and there this great man sat absorbed apparently in observing
                  the great flock of Fish Hawks.
               After smoking three segars, he arose and expressed a wish to proceed.
               They now entered the cave, and finding it satisfactory, he expressed himself in
                  this style:
               "I have been admiring the very fine prospect, and lively view (referring to the
                  birds) obtained on this Island of the sea; and the cave suits, while its
                  surroundings and location are more than grand; it borders on the Divine, as the
                  innumerable birds are like a great cloud of witnesses to the existence of
                  man."
               The Fish Hawks were very much disgusted at being intruded upon; for they always
                  appropriate an Island in this manner till disturbed by man, though sometimes they
                  will seek a lone tree.
               Off the coast of Maine is an Island answering the above 
                     discription
                     description
                   fully, excepting the cave.
               They returned from their private trip, and as the subject had been discussed, but
                  not settled, it was thought best to make
                  a great effort, as a failure at last could not be looked upon by the opponents in
                  any worse light than now.
               Accordingly, a committee, who would report favorably, was selected to visit the
                  island, and though Mr. Solomon had given a full and correct description, yet this
                  committee portrayed its beauties and advantages to such a degree that for a season
                  the indications were that the island would become an appendage of the great
                  cave.
               The reason why it was desirable that the order should buy the island was, the
                  order would be responsible for whatever disposition was made of it; and though it
                  might be devoted to some purpose foreign to what they might have anticipated, yet
                  the President would be blameless.
               The President again expressed himself to his counsellors in this wise:
               "I believe that island a good place for offenders, and who-ever might be
                  unfortunate enough to be so wicked as to get a home there, would be very fortunate
                  to have so grand a view of seeing the great flock of birds, and it would remind
                  them of the sweet days of liberty and lead to repentance, so that when their days
                  of exile were over they would be well prepared to return to their allegiance, and
                  it would be a fitting place for that crooked stick who opposed its purchase, and
                  if I can get him there, I certainly shall."
               This opponent was "splendid" in personal appearance, and a great orator; he had
                  the hearts of the common people generally, and he might be in the way of the
                  President's re-election. Therefore all those means that could be resorted 
                     to to
                     to
                   break him down in public estimation would be, and every effort made to
                  place him in that position where he would be powerless, and if he could banish him
                  to this island he would be out of the way fully.
               But for all the great efforts to secure the island, it was lost to the order.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               The troubles of this organization had but just begun.
               Having a man for their chief who had been educated by his Uncle Sam Americus in
                  the art of fencing, was not what they needed.
               Ever so good a swordsman may not be suitable for a controlling and civil head.
               Disputes are very unpleasant in any form and under any circumstances, and, as
                  before mentioned, several orders very similar to the order for the discovery of
                  natural curiosities and founding cities, though not having so fine a cave, had
                  broken the international-like laws governing all independent orders, and the
                  leading men of the order, and all the common people cried aloud to have justice
                  done.
               But the President feared, it is presumed, that though he had won great renown as
                  the leading swordsman in the art of fencing, and had acquitted himself so
                  satisfactory as to be enthusiastically promoted, would not like to loose that
                  great name gained, as he might if he again stepped to the front; he also knew
                  there was more money in his present course, and as all his counsellors shared in
                  the money, of course nothing would be done.
               But this management brought out all the strength of Mr. Solomon and a large number
                  of like stamp, while the people called loudly for a change in the departments of
                  Mr. Whale and Mr. Gunpowder.
               But all the satisfaction they got was smoke, smoke, till the President might as
                  well have been an Opium eater or smoker as to so completely make himself oblivious
                  to all these things by such an intemperate use of the "long nine."
               The causes of dissatisfaction with one of these orders were various.
               
               One was they had got to quarrelling among themselves, and every form of brutality
                  that could be practiced upon the dissatisfied was put in practice; it was a
                  distinct branch of this old and tyranical order that had become weary of its
                  oppressive power.
               They made overbearing and cruel laws, and so overtaxed the discontented portion
                  that they had become desirous to set up for themselves, inasmuch as a separate
                  order would be less expensive and under their own control, having a new and better
                  code of laws, like grown-up children starting out and making a home of their
                  own.
               But no, they must remain for the sake of the revenue brought to their old home by
                  oppression.
               Honorable men of other orders looking on in sympathy, and witnessing all kinds of
                  wrong, would seek to render assistance to the oppressed, though the least friendly
                  feeling shown by such was snubbed by this oppressive order, and lest assistance
                  might reach the now frantic and oppressed, there were various great ships of war
                  and innumerable armed men on the alert to prevent any such demonstration.
               And as some of the ships of the order for the discovery of natural curiosities and
                  founding of cities, sought as usual to carry on a legitimate traffic, these
                  oppressive old fogies insulted them in every possible way, and though the Hon. Mr.
                  Swells, who had charge of the Department of the Sea, called the attention of the
                  President to it, nothing was done, and though insult upon insult was given to
                  members of the order, imprisoning some and confiscating their property, and
                  killing others, yet no effort was made to prevent it.
               Is it a wonder that the people called for a change, and cheered on their champion,
                  Mr. Solomon?
               The Chief could ill afford to lose his renown as a swords man; he was unpopular
                  enough now, besides the Hon. Mr. Whale, who had charge of the foreign affairs of
                  the Government, positively declared that more money could be secured by letting
                  things alone, than interfering and asserting their rights.
               Other important affairs now agitated the order.
               There was an immense sum of money to be paid to them by an ancient order named the
                  Roaring Lion.
               The name was taken from the king of beasts, and suggested by the comparison made
                  by the Evil One and the Lion, as both are represented as going about
                  seeking whom they may devour, it clearly suggested this name as characteristic of
                  this old order.
               The Roaring Lion order had become involved in aiding and abetting those rascals
                  who had been discomfitted and brought to naught by the greatest of swordsmen, who
                  subsequently had been promoted in the order, and they were now informed of the
                  immense sum of money they must pay to settle the expense their meddling had
                  caused, while it would punish them quite properly, and lead them to see that
                  other's rights must be respected.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               It was soon to be decided whether the present incumbent should be re-elected to
                  the presidency, or that some other more suitable man should be, and so have the
                  Black House, with all its privileges and honors, as the great smoking swordsman
                  President had for the last four years.
               It was very desirable on the part of all in office to remain another term of four
                  years, as the great money times by the agreement of the Roaring Lion order, would
                  make very desirable a position of trust and power.
               And as the greatest of smoking Presidents had promised all officers, both great
                  and small, that they should remain in office if he was re-elected, but little else could be
                  attended to besides those affairs which would be of advantage to them.
               Though the law allowed a re-election at present, yet, Mr. Solomon and others were
                  endeavoring to make a law changing this, believing that it would put a stop to
                  corruption, and, of course, have a tendency to purify the order; this was another
                  reason why the President did not much like this man.
               If he had only waited till he had been in office a second term, as others had
                  been, he thinking himself entitled to the compliment, yet, fearing he might not
                  be, he was ready to join hands with any party that could turn the scale in his
                  favor.
               Amid all this turmoil and strife, there were various men mentioned as suitable
                  ones for the great and honorable position as Commander-in-Chief of all the land
                  and naval forces of the order.
               There were various qualifications important to be eligible to the office; lacking
                  any one of these prevented the otherwise qualified individual from becoming the
                  President.
               One of these requirements was, that his father must have been a member of the
                  order at the time of the candidate's birth.
               Now our long-headed President would smoke and think, then think and smoke.
               In his cogitations he would scan the condition of the civilized world, and most
                  vividly the state of a very ancient order, called Comeouters of the Cross, came
                  before his mind's eye, and if that ancient European order could be induced to come
                  to the vicinity of the great Cave, and the two orders unite in electing him, then
                  foes within and without would be powerless.
               A great many of this ancient order had already united with the order of the
                  Cave.
               We will glance at this ancient dilapidated order.
               It was more than eighteen hundred years old, and its name was derived from its
                  founder, because he came out from the wicked world and lived a good life, and ever
                  since a faithful successor has been elected to fill the office as head of the
                  order, retaining the office for his lifetime, being a great contrast to the length
                  of the term of the head of the order for seeking curiosities and founding
                  cities.
               Now the great head of this ancient Order of the Comeouters of the Cross was a very
                  old man, and soon he must go the way of all the earth, and furthermore ungodly and
                  worldly orders had caused him a great deal of trouble, fairly shaking his
                  dominions from centre to circumference, and causing the now aged head to feel
                  anxious to seek a new locality for his waning power.
               He was confidently informed that if he would establish his order in the vicinity
                  of the great cave, that all should be done for him during his lifetime that was
                  consistent for distinct and friendly orders to do (perhaps the President had the
                  Fish Hawk Island in view, in part for his safe retreat from worldly care).
               Let that be as it may, he was informed that his successor could be selected from
                  the native born persons comprising the great order of the cave, as there were many
                  talented and fully competent men who were Comeouters of the Cross, and now
                  belonged to the order.
               After which he could be elected to the Presidency of the order for seeking
                  curiosities and founding cities, also, as he would be eligible to fill this
                  office.
               The President thought that as he had been elected on account of his good fortune
                  as a swordsman, that the people would be as likely to make a choice from any other
                  of the walks of life, and an ecclesiastical profession would be as unobjectionable
                  to the order as a choice from the profession of arms. Without doubt it would prove
                  a wiser choice, as the mode of governing among the Comeouters of the Cross was
                  altogether by moral suasion, and not by sword and bayonet, using the language
                  "Come, we will do to others as we would they should do unto us," leading the order
                  in the path of love and peace, and though the contrast would be very great from
                  the present policy, yet a contrast, though great, is often beneficial.
               Then, after "ruling with a rod of iron" four years more, the President would be
                  quite willing to retire in favor of one who might know as little about statesmanship as himself; then his successor in
                  office would not excel him in a wiser discharge of duty; for one so selfish would
                  prefer a successor with whom the order might become as much disgusted as a large
                  portion were with him.
               This commanding all to obey, whether right or wrong, till the people would appeal
                  to law for protection, was a condition of things very undesirable, and to continue
                  such a policy by re-election of the great smoking swordsman was to say that the
                  sword and gun should rule, and not law and order.
               It was true that a chief so full of self, and a desire for the aggrandizement of
                  all his poor relations, as to seek them out, that he might put them in a position
                  in the order, where they too could improve their condition, and not hereafter be a
                  disgrace to him, or pensioners upon his bounty, would also receive gifts from the
                  rich, rewarding them with that class of offices which would enable them to doubly
                  save enough to make up for the gift made to the President, beside the salary and
                  honor. We learn by this that after all the poor relations are provided for, those
                  who desire an office must be either able to make a present which would be
                  equivalent to buying it, or they must be so influential in the order that a
                  position of eminence would make them an advantage to the party in power.
                  Relatives, with the rich and influential, then, were the ones eligible to
                  office.
               But the prospect of his re-election was quite good. Thousands upon thousands of
                  office-holders of the minor class, with those holding great ones, would work day
                  and night to bring about this.
               Though the President might meet with the fate of the frog, who thought to swell
                  himself up to the size of the ox, and burst, yet he would not take warning from
                  the common people, but in various ways show his superiority to them.
               How singular that after the common people had elected him as a poor, though
                  fortunate, swordsman, that he should take great delight in magnifying his
                  superiority to them in various ways; though many thought his good fortune like the
                  luck of the miner who finds a big lump of gold, yet is not superior in any respect
                  to his fellow miners.
               One of the most common modes of convincing them that he was a superior piece of
                  human flesh, was to spend much of his time in recreation at popular places of
                  resort of the aristocracy.
               At no time would he feel his greatness more than when riding like a king, with his
                  two great colored slaves and a team of the most valuable horses in the world and
                  his golden chariot, puffing himself into oblivion with his long nine, so far as
                  the interests of his office might affect him.
               Now, is it to be thought that those who had taken him from their own level, and
                  promoted him to office, thinking he would still be a warm-hearted equal in the
                  journey of life, that they would feel satisfied with his magnificent display of
                  his 
                     superioity
                     superiority
                   to them? Nay, verily.
               To his cost, he found too late, that his policy in all things had been a
                  blunder,—a sad failure at last.
               Still, those in office, and others equally interested, sought again to bring him
                  before the people, while the disaffected, with equal zeal for reform in governing
                  the order, looked about among the numerous worthy and able statesmen for an
                  opponent to him, and here they found a great difficulty, for many qualified men
                  who saw the President lacked statesmanship, united in heart and head to move the
                  people to seek reform. Finally, they selected a standard-bearer as an opponent,
                  who had been as much superior in bringing into the present glorious existence, and
                  its continuance in power the great order of the cave, to the present chief, as the
                  pen is mightier than the sword. His name was odd, corresponding with everything
                  else connected with the order: It was Tribune.
               As the President has been described, a description of Hon. Mr. Tribune will be
                  proper and interesting.
               In personal appearance, he was about as interesting looking man as could be found.
                  When you first look him in the face, you at once are reminded of the full moon.
                  Great, grand, noble and mild. His talents
                  were of the first order. None could say he was inferior in any of those great
                  abilities requisite for the greatest office in the order. He was also great in
                  goodness. His great benevolence and great heart of love embraced all mankind. His
                  whole life had been a labor of love for the human race.
               As the sun shines upon the moon, causing it to give light by night to the
                  universal world, so the great eternal light, and fountain of infinite wisdom and
                  goodness so endowed this great statesman, that the reflection through him to all
                  mankind fully showed that he would make a President after God's own heart;
                  ignoring self in his own aggrandizement, grasping in his arms of love, all, both
                  high and low.
               This kind of President was very much needed. Ruin was threatened all around. Help
                  must come, or a sadder time than was ever experienced would be the lot of the
                  order.
               The time was soon to come when the popular vote would declare whether the present
                  smoking swordsman should be reelected, or the Hon. Mr. Tribune should be called to
                  the high position he would so ably fill; and should justice be done, the election
                  would be decided in favor of reform, and a redemption from a condition little
                  better than ruin; and once more that glorious condition of the order so desirable
                  for happiness and prosperity, that was once its pride and beauty, when all the
                  orders of the earth looked upon it as the greatest, wisest, and best, would be
                  restored. With a hope that victory will crown the efforts of the reformers, and
                  they be enabled to bring once more the order out of chaos, and its prosperity be
                  the greater, and more fully appreciated, on account of its past fiery trials, "we
                  will put side and shoulder to the wheel" of reform, and go forward from
                  "conquering unto conquer," till its former glory shines. Then we shall appreciate
                  the restoration, and live happily for having done our duty, and die with the
                  reflection that the order is better for our having lived in it. "So let it
                  be."
